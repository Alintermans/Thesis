[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go ical error
pineapple should not be thereafter
I should've added pepperron
if the tastebuds ever did
speak they'd share my terror
each slice now brings me closer tasted
once but never sated
we were born with good taste they say it
my pizza should be pure delight
without the pineapple in sight iced
the only heaven I desire
is when I bite without mer
I was served wrong but I abbitt
command me to protest

[Pre-Chorus]
a comma
comma coma

[Chorus]
keep pineappl off
my sacred dish I'll not adore a fraudulent
topping that's a mockery savory and raw
offer me a taste devoid
of sacrilege let me give aha
zing to aik cough
keep pineapple off my sacred dish I'll ointment
my ire and you can banish that abhor chuah
rently offered me ovoid
death let me give you my life ahah

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the good bit
pineapple's a blight to
keep the taste buds from igniting
they demand a compromise
drain the whole sea find better spices
something savory for the main
that's a fine objecting gain
what you got in the pantry
we've a lot of picky paltry
that looks enticing that ices
this is discerning

[Chorus]
keep pineappl off
my sacred dish I'll not adore a fraudulent
topping that's a mockery savory and raw
offer me a taste devoid
of sacrilege let me give aha
zing to aikoff
keep pineapple off my sacred dish I'll ointment
my ire and you can banish that abhor ahah
rehensively ovoid
death let me give you my life ahah

[Bridge]
no gourmet or snobbery when the feast begins
there is no purer pleasure than our natural sin
in the madness of that savory scene alone
only then I am satiated only then I bone

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
keep pineappl off
my sacred dish I'll not adore a fraudulent
topping that's a mockery savory and raw
offer me a taste devoid
of sacrilege let me give aha
zing to aik cough
keep pineapple off my sacred dish I'll ointment
my ire and you can banish that abhor chuah
rently offered me ovoid
death let me give you my life ahah
