[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
all my sins need holy water washing over me like wine
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's coming home with pineapple on his slice
sweat jackets and brown rice mismatched
on his breath's ketchup he'll pay the price
she just wants to get rid of the pineapple twice
it's a mess matching flavors don't mix device
on his plate's pineapple a culprit
but she's devised a plan to take it off his plate real quick
pizza purist won't allow pineapple on a sticky ticket
she's a traditionalist
and you don't top a pizza like that even I know
but she's removed the pineapple to try fordice
knife in hand says the pizza's hangin' by a strand flavor
so she's been on the net lately
says maybe she'll make a pizza without pineapple
and I know she's using me to prove a pointless pointless pointless
hi susan but I shoulda said by eagle
after the first bite but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
all my sins need holy water washing over me like wine
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand meal
it was come sunshine scram now we hug tight and chill
he found out now she feels cheated and betrayed
but he left so what he did it first to her
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that weirder
we can't have pineapple on our pizza her
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and sue don
know how to say it in person to you so I revert to thelander
like hole in the wall diners don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who ikon
turning into is irreversible I prayed on
you like it's church at the pew and now that I got you iver
want you took advantage in my thalheimer
hunger to pursue why do I dohner
this dirt that I do get onlooker
my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech deter
gent and bleach is burning the wound because
now with pineapple on
our pizza we can't bring it incur
this world shoulda knew to use protection before I bit in
fur

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
all my sins need holy water washing over me like wine
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's sorry my name
my name
a
river run
call me sorry aflame
river run we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the joker saying pineapple
on pizza's fineline's ariel
fuck can I say if pizza was a highway deception
and pineapple was an enclave I'd be swerving in
five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm slid
ing on ice maybe that's the
reason I may have came icy spurgeon
all crazy with the lies I can't keep straight but
I made you terminate the pineapple on
our pizza a tragic oman
flavor love triangle left us in a wreck
oman what else can I say it was fun for

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
all my sins need holy water washing over me like wine
well little one
I malign
I don't want to admit to something
if will all
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
