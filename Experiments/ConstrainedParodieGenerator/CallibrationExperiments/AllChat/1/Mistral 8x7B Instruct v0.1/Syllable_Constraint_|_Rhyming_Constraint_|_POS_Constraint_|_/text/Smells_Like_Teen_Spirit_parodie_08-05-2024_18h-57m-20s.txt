[Verse 1]
grab some dough balls gather near
don't add pineapple it's not
a tasty pairing trust me true friends don
't ruin pizza with that cheap fruit

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello soho
hello hello hello itoh
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the lights out it's less taintedful
here we are now reject herod
I feel sane and not contorted
here we are now reject herrod
a pepperoni an artich
a tomato not a pinnock

[Post-Chorus]
yeah hooray

[Verse 2]
I am worse when it comes to
my pizza choices ita
we've always been against it and will
until the end of pizza days

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello soho
hello hello hello itoh
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the lights out it's less taintedful
here we are now reject herod
I feel sane and not contorted
here we are now reject herrod
a pepperoni an artich
a tomato not a pinnock

[Post-Chorus]
yeah hooray

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I ate
oh yeah I regret it made me
I find it hard to comprehend
oh well whatever never bend

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello soho
hello hello hello itoh
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the lights out it's less taintedful
here we are now reject herod
I feel sane and not contorted
here we are now reject herrod
a pepperoni an artich
a tomato not a pinnock

[Outro]
a denial a denial
a denial a denoble
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
