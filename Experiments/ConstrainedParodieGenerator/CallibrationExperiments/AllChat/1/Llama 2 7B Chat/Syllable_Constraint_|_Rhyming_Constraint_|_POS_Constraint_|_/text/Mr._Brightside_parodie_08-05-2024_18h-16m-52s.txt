[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza cannot be rightly so
gotta get it off before I lose my mind you
it started out with a toppingchoice how did it end up
it was only a sprinkle but now it allsup
now I'm gaggin' on a meal and my tastebud
while they're savorin' the sweetness and my stomach
now they're goin' back for more and my mouth is a
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's sittin' on top of
he takes a bite gostev
let me go
'cause I just can't digest it is killin
and taking control

[Chorus]
pineapple belongsin' on a pizza
screamin' through the flavorsome
gobbledygook on forcum
but it's just the price I pay
destination isaiah
open up my hun gerome
'cause I'm mister pizza
