to top our p breadfruit

[Verse 2]
you call it a topping I call it
a recipe for disappointment
our pizza should be plain and simple not

classic and not afridi

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about it on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
about how pineapple ruined our pizza
that's embarrassing you were my pizza add
and all that you did was make us frown and
so don't waste our time with ad
your pineapple nonsense don't make us feel bad I could talk
about every time that you didn't deliver
but I'd have an empty line because you never did we
never paid any mind to our topper

[Outro]
pineapple on our pie
should not be the thing that makes isty
making us happier than
ringing in the new year I wish it wer
