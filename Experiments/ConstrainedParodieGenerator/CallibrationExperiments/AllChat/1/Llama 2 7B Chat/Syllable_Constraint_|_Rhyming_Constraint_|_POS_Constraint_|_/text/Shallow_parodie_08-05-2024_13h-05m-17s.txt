[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
is it somethin' you desire mo
or just a fad you
can't you see it don't belue

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
we're fallin
in the pineapple haze we find olefin
and in
the bad times we're afraid of our

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me somethin
isn't it obvious it don't go
or do you need more
a pineapled world we can't ignore

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
we're fallin
in the pineapple haze we find our in
and in
the bad times we're afraid of our

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the ground
crash through the pineapple surface where they can
taste the sweetness of the fruit

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pineapple parad
in the pineapple utop ayyad
in the pineapple parad
we're far from the salty now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh aha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the ground
crash through the pineapple surface where they can
taste the sweetness of the fruit

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pineapple ha
in the pineapple world we aday
in the pineapple ha
we're far from the savory
