[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the toppings on my pierre
the juicy sweetness that's not mine to share
we can have pepperoni
and sausage on our minds
but please don't bring the pineapple near us
it's like a nightmare reminds
we'll wish this pineapple never ends
we'll wish this pineapple never finds its
our pies are savitz

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the pineapple nowad
I cannot digest its taste again ton
I need a topping without the
this tropical mad
haunts me with Its sweetness every time I
dream of pepperoni is
all I see is pineapple
please don't bring it near us again
like a nightmare reminds me of
our pies are savory
our pies are savory anderson
will you come backman

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't bring the pineapple on us you see
it's not a topping for
we wish it never finds
our pies are savory anderson we
our pies are savor
we wish it never finds

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't bring the pineapple on us you see
it's not a topping for
we wish it never finds
our pies are savory anderson we
our pies are savor
we wish it never finds
don't bring the pineapple on usury
it's not a tobler
we wish it never finds
our pies are savory anderson we
our pies are savor
we wish it never finds

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
