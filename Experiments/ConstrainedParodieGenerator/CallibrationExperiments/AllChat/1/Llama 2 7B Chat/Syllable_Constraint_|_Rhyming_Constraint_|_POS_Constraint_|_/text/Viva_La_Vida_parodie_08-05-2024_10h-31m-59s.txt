[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I tried to put pineapp
on a pizza once beforehand
but now I see it's just a sinful
disaster waiting atmel

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
it's like a tropical
invasion of flavor and texture
how could anyone be so
insane to put pineap on akao
pizza is a crime against
humanity and commenced
and I'm here to say no go go go go
no pineapple on pizza day noverco

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells are ringing loud and
roman cavalry choir singing
be my slice of mozzarella
my condolences on the floor ohba
pineapple has no place on pizza
never an honest topping
when I ruled the world I
knew what was good and what was not

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it's an abomination to
combine sweet and savory in
such a way it's like a culinar
