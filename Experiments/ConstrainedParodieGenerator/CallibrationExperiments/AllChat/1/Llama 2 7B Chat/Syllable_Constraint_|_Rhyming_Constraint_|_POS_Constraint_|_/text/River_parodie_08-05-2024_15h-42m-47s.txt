[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fan of pineapple
on my pizza had to take
been a lover of the sweet and tangy taste for years now it
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is hate
my love for pineapple now is falling downstate
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his pepperoni red
lovin' every bite of it
sweat drippin' from his brow as he takes
that first bite of pineapple on his p hotbed
it's a chorus of delightful flavors inbred
she just wants to exact revenge and get
back for the pineapple topping on his pizza that he
never asked for or wanted or needed or desired or even
thought about before he took
it was a spontaneous decision that he now reg
regrets with every bite of that p beckstead
actually just shit on my last pizza topping and
she has what my ex lacks and that
is a taste for something other than pineapple on
my pizza that is a crime against humanity and nature
I know she's using me to try to pion
e my pizza topping preferences

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fan of pineapple
on my pizza had to take
been a lover of the sweet and tangy taste for years now it
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is hate
my love for pineapple now is falling downstate
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a one pizza stand
it was come last bite then gone done hot and spicy
I found out now he feels abandoned and used
cause he left without his pineapple topping
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that herring
it didn't work out for pineapple on my punching
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof and nervous and sue
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth and my plying
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person to
you so I revert to the pettigrew
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
irreversible I preyed on you like it's church ongoing
I now that I got you I don't pining
for pineapple on my pizza toying
fuck did I do this dirty ditching
I get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and
speech detergent and bleach is burning the
wound cause now with her in
the womb we can't bring her in this wording
to use protection before I bit into your forbidden
fruit

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fan of pineapple
on my pizza had to take
been a lover of the sweet and tangy taste for years now it
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is hate
my love for pineapple now is falling downstate
so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my pineapple toppings
call me
pine
river run
let the river runnings
up pineapple on my pinkerton

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the pizza
fuck can I say if pizza waseda
highway and deceit was an enclave I d swerving in
five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
but I made you terminate my p pre
this love triangle left us in a mess tangled
what else can I say it was pizza for a
while bet I really woulda loveday
smile didn't really want to abort but fu
k what's one more lie to tell our unborn

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a fan of pineapple
on my pizza had to take
been a lover of the sweet and tangy taste for years now it
well little one
I don' fit
I don't want to admit to something
if p all
causes pain my love for pineapp
ling now is falling downstate so let the ascap
river run phoenix one
