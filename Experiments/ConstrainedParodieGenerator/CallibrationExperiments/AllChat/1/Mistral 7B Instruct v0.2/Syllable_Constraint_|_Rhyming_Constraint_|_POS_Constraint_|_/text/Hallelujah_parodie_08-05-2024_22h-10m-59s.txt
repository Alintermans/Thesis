[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that hillary made and it raffish
but you don't really crave for pineapple do
it goes like this the third the sixth
the sour rise the sweet decline
the confused chef composing inner turmo

[Chorus]
hallelujah pittsburgh hallel
hallelujah halleluj dull

[Verse 2]
your hunger was strong but you needed
proof a slice was served upgraded
her flavors in the oven overwhelmed ya
she placed a pineapple on your
cheese and tomatoes she arranged sor
and from your plate she extracted the hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pittsburgh hallel
hallelujah halleluj dull

[Verse 3]
you say I broke the pizza code
I don't even care for pine
but if I did well really what's it to me
there's a taste explosion in every
topping it doesn't matterease
the gourmet or the traditional hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pittsburgh hallel
hallelujah halleluj dull

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn'tketchup
I couldn't stomach so they textbook
I've told the truth I didn't make a fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll present before the headstrong
with nothing on my tongue but hollow hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pittsburgh hallel
hallelujah halleluj dull
hallelujah pittsburgh havel
hallelujah halleluj dull
hallelujah pittsburgh hateful
hallelujah hallel juul
hallelujah pittsburgh tasteful
hallelujah hallel juul
hallelujah pittsburgh ravel

[Outro]
hallelujah pittsburgh cruel

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this kitchen I've rossmore
I used to enjoy alone before I knew
and I've seen your pepperoni on the
margherita archlove isa
it's not a cheer that you hear at nighttimehour

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you offered me
what's really happening iny
but now you never serve it to me do you
and remember when I ordered you
the vegetarian tofu
and every morsel we ingested was ha

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to cook at someone who outcooked
and it's not a flavor that you hear at
nighttime in the kitchen it sarratt
it's a cold and it's a bitter hallelujah
