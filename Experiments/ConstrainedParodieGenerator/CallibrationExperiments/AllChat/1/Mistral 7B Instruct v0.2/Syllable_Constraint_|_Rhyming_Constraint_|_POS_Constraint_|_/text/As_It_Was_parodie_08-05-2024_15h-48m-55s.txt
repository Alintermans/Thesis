[Intro]
come on pepperoni lovers worldwide today

[Verse 1]
topping it off
pineapple'ss presence ruoff
I want authenticity in every
why don't we agree and let
savor the taste
not interfere with pizza's paste
perfection can't replace
and I'll be the one who'll save our plate

[Chorus]
in this world of flavors
you know it's not the same without the
in this world of savors
you know it's not the same without the
as it was before we
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple lovers mayall
why build a wall around tradition's hall
what kind of madness makes you
pepperoni
and nobody's adding to the
you just want to maintain the
they just want to know that it's still here to stay

[Chorus]
in this world of flavors
you know it's not the same without the
in this world of savors
you know it's not the same without the
as it was before we
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go back to the basics fresh tomatoes
I don't wanna debate about the changes in
kids top their pizza with ham or bacon
I don't wanna debate who's doing it first or

[Outro]
as
you know it
pizza's not the same without the it
as it was before it
