He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on\nall my sins need cleansing water felt it washing over\nwell little one I don't want\nif all it's gonna cause a commotion inmont\nthe truth and my lies now\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe brings it home sliced on his pizza plate to\njack daniels and tomato sauce\nbut she hates it with a passion so\nit's a battle in the kitchen heated andrew\nhe insists it complements the flavor sheila\nbut she says it's an abomination\nand uses her spatula as a weapon in hand with\ndetermination to ban this intruder in the pantry and land\nbecause she craves tradition\nit's a test of wills a culinary warfare act two\nshe's kept track of all his orders online ata\ngrocery store app and guess who just happens to order\npineapple on his pizza pie\nactually just bought one from guy number three to\nprove a point and she has what my ex lacked oh dear me oh dear me\ncause she's a traditionalist andrea\nand you don't order pineapple on\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on\nall my sins need cleansing water felt it washing over\nwell little one I don't want\nif all it's gonna cause a commotion inmont\nthe truth and my lies now\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na late night ordering spree turned midnight\nit was come morning light we shared a bite and then\nhe found out she felt cheated and used because\nhe left it behind so what he did too to\nnow how am I supposed to tell this lady ata\nit's over it's a pineapple free world now iida\ndon't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth\ndon't take it personal I just cannot say this in person tota\nso I revert to the mic like holeinthewall record stores boom boom\nI just feel like the person I wasmuth\nbecoming irreversible I regretted it\nI took advantage of your love for this dish that I ado\nwhy do I do this I ask myself nowa\nget on my soapbox and preach myrilla\nketchup and mustard is burning a\nwound because now with her in the oven we can\nbring it to the table but we can't\nbring it to the table\nwhat's one more lie to tell our unita\nfuck I wish I had used protection before I bit into\nyour\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's anna my name\nriver\noh\nriver run\ncall me anna nickname\nriver oh oh oh run run runnion\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the pineapple lover never\nfuck can I say if pizza isautier\nand deceit is a seasoning I came atcha sideways\nthat's why I may have came atcha sidewaysiida\nI can't keep my lies straight like a pine\nbut I made you terminate\nthis love triangle left us inertness\nwhat else can I say it was fun for a while bet\nI really woulda loved your smile didnt really\nwanna abort but what's one lessley\nwhat's one less lie to tell our unborn child\nI wish I coulda used protection before\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on\nall bad choices\nI' proton\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif it's just\n\nthe truth and my lies now are fall\ning like the rain falling like the rain falling all\n",
