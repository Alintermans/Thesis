[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' while we're meetin' some people say
it's a topping that's quite neat but I don
t think it's somethin' that I'd be
eatin' on a pie that's meant to be sav
ory not sweet that's just how I feel about it don
t you agree that it's just dov
ish to put fruit on
a pizza that's supposed to be a meal it's just not right ight
for my stomach or my taste buds it's just not tight

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know why you'd put that on a pie
don't you know it just don't belong there in the
first place I don't think it's somethi ething
that I'd ever want to see on a pizza itty

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
toppings that I like the most
you knowingly
put that piggly
pineapple to
pping on a pie that
I would never choose topsy
turvy toyota
songs they justina

[Verse 2]
so have you got a clue
as to why you'd do that to a pizza
it's just not somethin' that I'd ever do do
I don't think it's right to ruin a perfectly good
pie with somethin' that don't belong there in the first place do
you know what I mean it's just not clean it's aouzou
and I don't think that I can ever belew

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know why you'd put that on a pie
don't you know it just don't belong there in the
first place I don't think it's somethi ething
that I'd ever want to see on a pizza itty

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the toppings that I like
the most knowingly put that
pineapple topping beaklike
on a pie that I'll never ghostlike
ever choose topsy turvy toyota
songs they just in a minor key
make me w weinreich
ever thought eellike
crawlin' back toothlike

[Outro]
do I wanna know why you'd put that on a pie
don't you know it just don't belong there in the
first place I don't think it's somethin' that I'd e
ver want to see on a pizza itty bunowski
knowingly put that piggly pineapple toppin' on
a pie that I'll never choose to nom nom nom nom nom
do I wanna know do you want me crawlin' back to you
