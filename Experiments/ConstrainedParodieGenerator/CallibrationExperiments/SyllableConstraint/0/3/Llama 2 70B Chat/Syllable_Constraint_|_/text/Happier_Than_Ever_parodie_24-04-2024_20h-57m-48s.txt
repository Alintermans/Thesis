[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain it clear
it just don't belong

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to collect my thought s on this
I need to express my dis
belief that you'd put that on
a pizza crust with cheese and
sauce it's just not right don't you
see it's like putting spaghetti
on a hot dog it's just not
right it's a crime against culinary art don
't you know that in your heart don't you know
that it's wrong don't you know that it's wrong don't you know that it's wrong
and now I'm singing this song
to let you know that it's wrong
to put pineapple on a pizza it's wrong it's wrong
it's wrong it's wrong it's wrong it's wrong

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain it clear it just don't
belong it just don't belong it just don't belong it
just don't belong it just

[Verse 2]
you call me a hater for saying
this but I don't care I'll say it
loud and clear pineapple on a pizza is
a sin it's a crime against human it
ity it's a travesty
it's like putting ketchup on a
steak or mayonnaise on a hot
dog it's just not right it's just

[Verse 3]
not right and I don't know why you'd even try to make
such a mistake it's like you're trying to
ruin the sanctity of this beautiful food
called pizza that's been around for centuries
it's like you're trying to ruin it for
everyone it's like you're trying to
make it worse it's like you're trying to make it worse it's like you
re trying to make it worse it's like you're trying to
make it worse it's like you're trying to make it worse it's like
you're trying to make it worse it's like you're tried

[Outro]
