[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to be the king
of the pizza scene but now I'm just
a peasant with a slice that
sings a sad melody pineapple doesn

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pizza bells a ringin' roman

taken over pizza
it's a crime it's just not right it

I hear pizza bells a ringin' roman
cavalry choirs are singin' be a
pizza my mirror my sword and
shield my missionaries in a foreign
field for some reason I can't ice
explain why pineapple has taken ov
er pizza it's a crime
it's just not right it's time to take
