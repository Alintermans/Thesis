[Verse 1]
first things first
I got a message that's burning in me
I'm fired up and tired of
the way that pizza's been treated
the way that pizza's been treated

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you tell me what you think that I should eat
I'm the one who knows what
I want on my pie supreme oh oh
the master of my taste buds oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was a fan of the classic
a purist when it comes to toppings
but then they had to go and add
pineapple and my world was shaken oh oh singing
from the heartache of the pain of
seeing my favorite food go
down the drain with the pineapple
juice and the ham and the pineapp

[Chorus]
pineapple you made me a you made
me a believer bel
ievever pineapple you break me
down you build me up bel
ievever pineapple oh let the hate flow
my taste my love my standards it came
from pineapple you made me a you
made me a believer

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the pizza gods up
above all the hate that
they've heard has turned my stomach to mush oh
my stomach up above oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was choking on the to
ppings that they call hawaiian style
building my rage up in the cloud
falling like ash into the bin
hoping my feelings they would drown but they never did
ever lived ebbing and flowing inhibited limited
till it broke and

[Chorus]
pineapple you made me a you made
me a believer bel
ievever pineapple you break me
down you build me up bel
ievever pineapple oh let the hate flow
my taste my love my standards it came
from pineapple you made me a you

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the oven and the heat
you're the face of the future
the cheese on my pie oh oh
the cheese on my pie oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited till it broke and rained down it ra
ined down like

[Chorus]
