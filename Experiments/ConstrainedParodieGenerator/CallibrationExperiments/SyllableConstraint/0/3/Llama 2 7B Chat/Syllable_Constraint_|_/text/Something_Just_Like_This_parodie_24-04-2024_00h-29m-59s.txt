[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the recipes and the
pineapple on a slice
it doesn't belong on
a pizza at all
hercules and his meat
spiderman's web of deceitful delight no way to

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go to get a
pineapple on a pie
not looking for something that's oh
so sweet and so sour at
the same time it's just
not worth the trouble
I want something just like this
no pineapple in sight
just cheese and pepperoni

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just
like this pizza pie
oh I want something just
like this pizza pie oh oh oh
oh I want something just
like this pizza pie
no pineapple in sight
just cheese and pepperoni oh
oh I want something just like

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the history of the
pineapple and its place
on a pizza it's a
fruit not a topping it
belongs in a bowl or
on a salad but not on a pie no way

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go to get a
pineapple on a pie
not looking for something that's oh
so sweet and so sour at
the same time it's just
not worth the trouble
I want something just like this
no pineapple in sight

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like
this pizza pie oh oh oh

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
no pineapple in sight
just cheese and pepper
oh I want something just
like this pizza pie oh oh oh
oh I want something just
like this pizza pie
no pineapple in sight

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
to get a pizza that
isn't covered in pineapple
not looking for something that
is oh so sweet and
oh so sour at
the same time it's just not worth
the trouble it's just not
worth it no pineapple in

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
