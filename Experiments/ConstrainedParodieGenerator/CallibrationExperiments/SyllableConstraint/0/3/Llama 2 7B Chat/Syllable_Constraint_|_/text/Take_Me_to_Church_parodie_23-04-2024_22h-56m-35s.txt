[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie
it's a crime against humanity
can't you see it's a sinful sight
disrupting the delicate flav
of the cheese and beef inside ton
it's a culinary
catastrophe of the highest grade
pineapple has no place
on a pizza that's been baked and gla
it's a travesty of the ut
most heinous kind so don't even
think about putting it on top of
your pizza pie it's a sin
you'll be sorry if you do so
pineapple has no home

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no oh
no no no no

[Chorus]
don't put the
pineapple on the pizza pie it's a sinful
deed don't do it don't even think about
it's a crime against flavor
don't be a sinner in the eyes
of the pizza
gods don't put the pineapple on the pizza
pie it's a sinful act of the highest order
don't do it don't you
know it's a pizza sin don't put

[Verse 2]
it's a fruit that's sweet and juicy but
it doesn't belong on
a pizza that's been cooked to per
fection it's a flavor that
clashes with the cheese and sauce in a
pizza catastrophe of the
utmost kind so don't you
even think about putting
it on your pizza pie it's a
sin that will make you cry so don
pineapple has no

[Chorus]
don't put the
pineapple on the pizza pie it's a sinful
deed don't do it don't even think about
it's a crime against flavor
don't be a sinner in the eyes
of the pizza
gods don't put the pineapple on the pizza
pie it's a sinful act of the highest order
don't do it don't you
know it's a pizza sin don't put

[Bridge]
so if you want to be a pizza hero you
must avoid the pineapple zero oh no oh no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no oh no
no no no no

[Chorus]
don't put the
pineapple on the pizza pie it's a sinful
deed don't do it don't even think about
it's a crime against flavor
don't be a sinner in the eyes
of the pizza
gods don't put the pineapple on the pizza
pie it's a sinful act of the highest order
don't do it don't you
know it's a pizza sin don't put
