[Verse 1]
oh pineapple on a pizza oh
it's a topping that just won't go
it's sweet and tangy but it doesn't belong here
it's like a tropical parad
but on a pie it's just not fair
it's a culinary crime scene oh pineap

[Chorus]
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple

[Verse 2]
you see it's a tradition to have
pepperoni and sausage and
mushrooms and olives too but pineapple is
just not in the mix for me and
you it's like a flavorful faux pas
oh pineapple on a pizza oh no please

[Chorus]
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple

[Verse 3]
I know some folks might say it's fine
but to me it's a taste divine
that doesn't belong on a pie that's just not
right it's like a flavorful crime scene oh
pineapple on a pizza no
no no no no no no no no no no no

[Chorus]
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple

[Verse 4]
I've tried it with cheese and without
but pineapple is just not a fit
it's like a flavorful anomaly oh
pineapple on a pizza no
no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no

[Chorus]
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple

[Outro]
hallelujah no pineapple

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this topping it's not a
I used to love it but now I'm bored with it
and every time I see it on a
piece of crust it's like a flavor
that doesn't belong oh pineapple on a pie

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time when I would eat
it with a smile and a treat but
now it's just not my scene oh pineapple on
a pizza no no no no no no
it's like a flavorful mistake
oh pineapple on a pizza oh no please no

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a topping that
can make it on a pizza but
it's not pineapple oh no no no no no
it's a flavorful sin oh pineapple
on a pizza no no no no no
it's a culinary crime scene oh pineapple
