[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple quite que
on your pizza pie distasteful bile or glee question me
is it sweet or is it sour on your
tongue a never ending fightful
dreams of pepperoni delightful ha
unt it on repeat until you fall asleep drunken
stains upon your carpet floor a
nno desire for
pineapple evermore a war between sweet and savory
cravings you abhor a fruit unworthy of a

[Pre-Chorus]
should I give it a try once more and see if it
pleases me no more pineapple on my plate for me
baby we both know that pizza's meant for cheese and
tomato sauce and toppings savory and true not

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to pine
ever thought of tryin' a
veggie slice or
maybe I'm too
busy enjoy

fall for fake fruit again now
I've thought it through craw
lin' back to no pine

[Verse 2]
so do you have the nerve
to put pineapple on your slice again
I dare you to taste the verve of real pizza
simmer down and taste the zest of real pizza love affair
don't interrupt with pineapple despair it's just not fair
to real pizza love we could be together if you
wanted to without the pineapple curse no more

[Pre-Chorus]
should I give it a try once more and see if it
pleases me no more pineapple on my plate for me
baby we both know that pizza's meant for cheese and
tomato sauce and toppings savory and true not

of callin' for real pizza
when you've had a few slices
'cause I always do maybe I'm too wise
to fall for fake fruit again now I've thought
it through crawlin' back to no pine
outro rapped in rhythm and
rhyme do I wanna
know if this pine hate

[Outro]

ing that it'd stay baby we both know that pizza
was mainly made for savory flavors not for
sweet fruit on top do I wanna know too busy hat
ing pine to fall for real pizza again sad to see
