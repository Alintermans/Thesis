[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni and cheese
are toppings tried and true
but pineapple's dece
on pizza it won't
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you wanna go
how far will you revol
I'm not looking for a pie that
has pineapple involved oh
no superhero
no tropical twist
just something I can eat now
without a single twist
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
but pineapple's a creep
on pizza it won't

doo doo doo doo doo do doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much will you revolt no
I'm not looking for a slice that
has pineapple involved no

just something I can eat now
