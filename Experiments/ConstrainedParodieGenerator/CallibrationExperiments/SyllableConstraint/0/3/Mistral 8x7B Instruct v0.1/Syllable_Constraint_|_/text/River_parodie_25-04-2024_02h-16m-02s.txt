[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with pineapple on his plate
to catch flack sweat jackets and dress
slacks on his breath it's a mistake he
shouldn't have added pineapple to his pizza
it's a mess she just wants to express her disdain
and get that pineapple off her pizza
it's a chess match he's on the defense like a jetpack she
won't let it go she's on a mission to remove that pineapple
from his pizza he's devised
a plan to keep it on his pizza she's got a knife in
hand says their relationship's hangin' by a thread
so she's been on the net lately says maybe she'll start a
movement to get pineapple off
pizza and he doesn't care he just wants to enjoy
his pizza the way he likes it so he says hi to pineapple
and bye to her pizza toppings are subject
to taste but pineapple should never be

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words

was come morning he'd remove the pineapple and

find the words to tell this girl that pineapple
doesn't belong on pizza he knows she's using him
to try to prove a point he doesn't care he just wants
to enjoy his pizza the way he likes it so he says
hi pineapple but he shoulda said bye pineapple after the first bite
but he couldn't resist the sweet and savory combo so he re
verts to his old ways and adds pineapple
to his pizza again and again he knows it's wrong
but he can't help himself he's addicted to the taste of
pineapple on pizza and he knows it's not
right but he can't help himself he's a
pineapple pizza lover through and
through and he knows it's wrong but he can't help it
he's a pineapple pizza lover and
