to tell the world to sever
their love for pineapple on
a slice that's meant to be savored

do you even bother to
consider how it tastes so vile and wrongly placed
on a dish that's meant to be enjoyed with
cheese and pepperoni and sausage and such delightful things instead
it's such a shame you can't

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask for pineap
please don't put me through this test of
my patience and my love for you as a friend

you never did anything right by me or the pizza
never paid any mind to the toppings that

[Outro]
you ruined the pizza for
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just leave me and my pizza alone yeah
ah
ah ah
ah
ah ah
ah ah
