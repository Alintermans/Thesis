[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow
the slimy fruit mixed with cheese and tomato
I spit it out and now I'm telling you how

[Verse 2]
oh that sweet and savory combination's a trap
it's a monstrosity that should never
have been allowed to happen on a flatbread map
I'm still in disbelief that someone would wrap

[Pre-Chorus]
a fruit that doesn't belong
in a pizza pie like that
I thought I could handle it but I was wrong oh
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
because there it was again on that round plate
a pineapple disaster that I couldn't escape wind in
my hair I was there I reg
ret it all too well oh oh oh

[Verse 3]
the canned fruit chunks glistening in the light a sight that made
me cringe and question humanity's plight a crime against pizza that
can't be undone once it's been made oh how I wish I could
have stopped it all from happening but it was too late
and now I'm left with the memory of that fateful night oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
because there we are again in the middle of
the night we're dancing around the kitchen in the moonlight oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you topped it all with
pineapple chunks oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time I see pineapple on
a pizza slice it's like I'm reliving that meal oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to forget that night but I'm still trying to find it oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
because there we are again when I took
a bite of that pie with pineapple oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at hiding my distaste but the punch
line goes pineapple on pizza is a cul
inary mistake oh how I wish it
wasn't true but it's a fact that's been haunting
me since that fateful night oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro]

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Spoken Outro]
I hate you guys so much
