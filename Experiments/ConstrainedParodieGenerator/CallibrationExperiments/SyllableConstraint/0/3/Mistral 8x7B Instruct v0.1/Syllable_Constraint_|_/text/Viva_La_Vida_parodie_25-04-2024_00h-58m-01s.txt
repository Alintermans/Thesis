[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice foot

only to find it's

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to love the taste
but now it's left a bitter taste in
my mouth as I recall the
time I thought it was a valid option
one bite and I regretted

to pizzas free from pineapple decay

pizza pie that's meant to be savored

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
my taste buds cry out in protesting
be my guide and show me the way

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
hear the bells of disappointment ring
oh no oh no oh no
pizza lovers crying in protest
oh no oh no oh no
be my guide and show me the way
oh no oh no oh no
to pizzas free from pineapple decay
oh no oh no oh no
for some reason I can't explain
oh no oh no oh no
I know the pizza gods won't forgive
the inclusion of this
combination that I once thought

[Outro]
oh no oh no
oh no oh no
oh no
