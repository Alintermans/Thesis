He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is off\nthe truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with pineapple on his plate\nto catch flack sweat jackets and dress\nslacks on his breath it's a mistake he\nshouldn't have added pineapple to his pizza\nit's a mess she just wants to express her disdain\nand get that pineapple off her pizza\nit's a chess match he's on the defense like a jetpack she\nwon't let it go she's on a mission to remove that pineapple\nfrom his pizza he's devised\na plan to keep it on his pizza she's got a knife in\nhand says their relationship's hangin' by a thread\nso she's been on the net lately says maybe she'll start a\nmovement to get pineapple off\npizza and he doesn't care he just wants to enjoy\nhis pizza the way he likes it so he says hi to pineapple\nand bye to her pizza toppings are subject\nto taste but pineapple should never be\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is off\nthe truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one night stand turned a two night stand it\nwas come morning he'd remove the pineapple and\nshe'd be left with just cheese and bread it's hard to\nfind the words to tell this girl that pineapple\ndoesn't belong on pizza he knows she's using him\nto try to prove a point he doesn't care he just wants\nto enjoy his pizza the way he likes it so he says\nhi pineapple but he shoulda said bye pineapple after the first bite\nbut he couldn't resist the sweet and savory combo so he re\nverts to his old ways and adds pineapple\nto his pizza again and again he knows it's wrong\nbut he can't help himself he's addicted to the taste of\npineapple on pizza and he knows it's not\nright but he can't help himself he's a\npineapple pizza lover through and\nthrough and he knows it's wrong but he can't help it\nhe's a pineapple pizza lover and\nhe knows it's wrong but he\ncan't help himself he's a pineapple add\nicted and he knows it's wrong but he can't help it he's a\npi\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's pineapple it\ndoesn't\nbel\nong on a\npizza river run call\nme pineapple we'll let the river\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the joker with my words always\nthe pineapple lover with my pizza\ncan't keep my love for pineapple off my pizza can\n't keep my love for pineapple off my pizza can't\nkeep my love for pineapple off my damn\npizza it's a love hate rel\nationship with pineapple on pizza\nit's a love hate relationship with pineapple\non pizza it's a love hate relationship\nwith pineapple on pizza it's a\nlove hate relationship with pineapple on\npizza it's a love hate relationship with\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\ns gonna do is offend you\nthe truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain\n",
