[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
its strange and not so true
ham and pepper on
a pizza's where it's on
but I'm not the kind who'll eat that one thing done wrongly

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said what's your preference
how much you wanna pers
pineapple on a pizza's not
the choice for me at first i
no exotic fruit
no savory curse
just something simple and pure
someone I can trust and
I want something just like

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
it's not a classic rule
anchovies and olives
on pizza's where they're cool
but I'm not the kind who'll follow the same old

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where do you wanna go
how much you wanna pers
pineapple on a pizza's not
the choice for me at first i
no tropical fruit
no savory curse
just something simple and pure
someone I can trust and

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where do you wanna
go how much you wanna
persist with pineapple on a
pizza when there's so much more
no exotic fruit
no savory bore
just something simple and pure
someone I can trust and
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
