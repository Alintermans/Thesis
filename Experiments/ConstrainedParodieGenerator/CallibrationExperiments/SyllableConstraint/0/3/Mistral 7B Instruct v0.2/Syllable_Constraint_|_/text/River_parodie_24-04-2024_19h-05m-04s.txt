[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame
truth and my lies now

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he orders up a pizza with a surprise
topping that's bound to raise some eyes
pineapple on it's not a delight
and she just wants to ignite a fight and deny
it's a battle of taste buds and preferences
she's kept track of all the disapprovers
and guess who just happens to be moving on to the side
'cause she's a purist and can't abide a pineapple on a pizza
'cause she hates the taste and texture
and you don't mess with a foodie's preference even
I know she's using me to try to change his mind
'cause she's a traditionalist and I'm the pineapple sign
but she's devised some plan to make
him see the error of his ways and forgo the pine
knife in hand she says their relationship's at stake now's the time to
take a stand and make a stand against the pine
so she's been on the web lately searching

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a pizza night turned into a heated
discussion about the toppings we've been debait
ed he found out she felt betrayed and used up
'cause he added pineapple and she felt abused
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof and nervous and
I don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the
truth so I revert to the studio like a hole in the wall diner
don't have to be reserved in a booth I just feel like the person
I'm turning into's irreversible
I preyed on your love for tradition and now that we
have a child in the oven we can't bring her in this world
shoulda known to use protection before we
bit into your forbidden fruit and now
we're stuck in this debate about the
pineapple on a pizza that we both love and
hate at the same time it's a
pineapple paradox
'cause now with our child in the womb we can't
bring her in this world with a pineapple on her pizza should
have

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame
truth and my lies now are

run call me ooh call me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the jester with a joke to play
fuck can I say if pizza's a stage and
pineapple's the elephant in the room I came at you
sideways I can't keep my lies straight but I made you
terminate our baby this love square
left us in a wreck tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a
while but I really woulda loved your smile didnt't want
to abort but what's one more lie to tell or
pineapple on a pizza debate
so let the river run little one I'm so
sorry I don't want to admit to this

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
causes is a pineapple on
a pizza debate that's a shame truth and my lies
