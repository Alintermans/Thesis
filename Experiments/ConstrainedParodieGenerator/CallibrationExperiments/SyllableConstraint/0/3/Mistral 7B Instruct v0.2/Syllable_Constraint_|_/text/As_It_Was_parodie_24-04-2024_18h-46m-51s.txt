[Intro]
come on folks gather round and let me say this true

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's taste is all wrong on
the top it doesn't belong where it's thrownwhy
can't we agree and leave it
behind instead
when flavor combinations coll
our palates are left to
endure this dreadful blend and I'm the one

[Chorus]
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same as it stood
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same as it stood
as it stood as it stood
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza lovers cry out in
disbelief at the sight of pineapple
on their pie why are they so
insistent on
adding this fruit to their dish that
has lost its authentic taste
they just want to know that it's great oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same as it stood
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same as it stood
as it stood as it stood
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home and order plain and simple pie
I don't wanna talk about the way that it used
leave tradition behind and try something
new I don't wanna talk about who's ordering

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was as it was as
it was you know it's not
