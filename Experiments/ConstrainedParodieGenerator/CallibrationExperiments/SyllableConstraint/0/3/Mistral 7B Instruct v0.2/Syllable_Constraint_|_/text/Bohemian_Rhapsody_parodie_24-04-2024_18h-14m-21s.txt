[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping fiasco I'm stuck in this culinary
landslide with no escape from this debate pie
I'm just a simple palate refusing pine
but society insists it's fine and dandy oh pineap
please don't make me cry if I'm not back again this time

[Verse 1]
papa just put a slice
of pineapple on my pizza pie I resisted but
now it's ruined all my taste
papa life had just begun but now it
tastes like a mistake papa ooh I didn
t mean to make you cringe if I'm not back next
time order something else carry on carry on as if

[Verse 2]
it's too late for my taste
pineapple sends shivers down my palate aching all
the time goodbye my fellow foodies got
to leave you all behind and face the truth pine
apple ooh I don't wanna bite
I sometimes wish I'd picked
a different topping at all pepperon

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]

a pizza pie scaramouche scaramouche will you do
