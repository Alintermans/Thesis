[Chorus]
it's just not right you see
it's not the same as it was meant to

[Verse 2]
it's a fruit that
belongs on a plate or in

be and it's not the same
as it was before or after or
it's not the same as it
was in the past or will

like pepperoni or sausage or mushrooms too or
anchovies or olives or bacon or
