[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the sweetness going to
I cannot taste it without a reason
I need something to complement
this savory pie
and pineapple doesn't do it for me at
all the spices and herbs and
veggies and meats and cheeses
can't mask the taste of tropical
that doesn't belong on a pie
will you take it away and
stop this pineapple pain tonight please god
stop this pineapple

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza is already
perfectly delicious
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza is already
perfectly delicious

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza is already
perfectly delicious
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza is already
perfectly delicious
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza is already
perfectly delicious
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza is already
perfectly delicious

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
