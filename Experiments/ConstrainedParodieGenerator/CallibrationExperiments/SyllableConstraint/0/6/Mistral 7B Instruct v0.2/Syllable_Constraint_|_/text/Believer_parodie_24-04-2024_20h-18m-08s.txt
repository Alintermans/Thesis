first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
that won't persist or impress

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you judge me for my food preference ple
pineapple's my choice and
it's my palate's release oh oh
my palate's release oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
some call it a culinary
sin against the pizza industry
but I'll stand by my decision
pineapple's my passion and reason oh oh oh oh
pineapple's my solace from the
monotony of cheese and tom
it's not just a simple tom tom
pineapple's my flavorful com

[Chorus]

a believer in this
pain in the pineapple pie you break
and build me up belie
pain in the pineapple pie let the debate
rain on and on and on and on and
pain in the pineapple pie you made
a believer in this

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the pizza gods up
keep the hate for pineap
lees away from our cup oh oh oh
our love for pineapple up

[Pre-Chorus]
some call it a crime against
the sacred pizza tradition
but I'll defend my choice with pride
pineapple's my delight and guide
it's not just a simple hide and seek game oh oh oh
pineapple's my savior from the monotony of meat and
cheese it's a burst

pain in the pineapple pie you made
a believer in this

by the grace of the fire and the flames
you're the face of the pizza
the sauce in my veins oh oh
the sauce in my veins oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
it's not just a simple hide and seek game oh oh oh
pineapple's my savior from the monotony of meat and
cheese it's a burst

a believer in this
pain in the pineapple pie you break
and build me up belie
