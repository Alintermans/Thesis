He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover with a twist\nall my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is a\npineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame\nso let the sauce simmer\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe orders up a pizza with a surprise\ntoppings that clash and create a\npineapple on a pizza parad\noxide with those who prefer the traditional\nit's a culinary clash like a game of hide\nand seek with the anchovies and pineap\nplease don't be the one to divide us all with your pine\napple on a pizza obsession that's absurd and wildly impol\nit's a battle of tastes like\na chess match in the kitchen where we collide and collide\nbut she's devised a plan to change the game with her\npineapple on a pizza crusade and I have what the\ntraditionalists lack she loves the\nunconventional and you don't mess with a man\n's pizza preference even I know that but she's got a scheme to\nchange the way we taste and I'm along for the\nride with my pineapple on a pizza\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover with a twist\nall my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is a\npineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame\nso let the sauce simmer\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na simple pie turned into a complex\ncreation it was pepperoni and cheese but\nnow it's a tropical sensation with a\npineapple on a pizza twist it's a con\nfusion of flavors that's hard to explain but I tried\nto tell her it's a mistake but she's determined to\npersist in her quest for the perfect blend of sweet and sav\nory but now I'm stuck in this pineapple on a pizza rut and it\nfeels like I've lost control I just want to tell her the truth but how do\nI break it to her that her pineapple\non a pizza obsession is driving us apart\nnow how am I supposed to tell her that we're through it's hard to\nfind the words I'm aloof and she's upset but\nI can't keep my lies straight I just want\nto enjoy a simple pizza night\nbut now I've got this pineapple on a pizza\nobsession that's irreversible and\nI've taken advantage\nof her love for the unconventional and\nnow I'm the one who's causing the pain why do I do this to\nher\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's pineapple on\na pine\napp\nle pizza\nrun run run run run run\ncall me pineapple on a pizza\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the trendsetter never the trend\nfuck can I say if pizza was a trend\nand pineapple was the odd one out I'd be ordering\nup a storm with my pineapple on a pizza lead\nbut that's why I may have came at you side\nways I can't keep my to\nppings straight but I made you terminate the\npineapple on a pizza experiment that\nleft us in a wreck tangled in our own\npineapple on a pizza debate\nwhat else can I say it was fun for a while\nbut I really woulda loved your classic smile\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover with a twist\nall my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align\nwell little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\ngoes to cause is a pineapple\non a pizza debate that's a shame so let the\n",
