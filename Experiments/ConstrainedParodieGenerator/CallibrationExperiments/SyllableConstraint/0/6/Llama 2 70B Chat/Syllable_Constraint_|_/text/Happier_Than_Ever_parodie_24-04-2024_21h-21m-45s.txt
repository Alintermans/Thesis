[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain it clear
it just don't belong

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to collect my thought s on this
I need to express my dis
belief that you'd put that on
a pizza crust with cheese and
sauce it's just not right don't you
see it's like putting spaghetti
on a hot dog it's just not
right it's a crime against culinary art don
't you know that in your heart don't you know
that it's wrong don't you know that it's wrong don't you know that it's wrong
and now I'm singing this song
to let you know that it's wrong
to put pineapple on a pizza it's wrong it's wrong
it's wrong it's wrong it's wrong it's wrong

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain it clear it just don't
belong you clearly weren't aware that you made me miserabe
so if you really want to

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask me to meet
you at the pizza parlor down the
street I'm excited at first but then I see
the pineapple on top of the cheese it
makes me want to scream and shout
and throw my phone against the wall
I don't relate to you and
your pineapple pizza ways

[Verse 3]
I don't talk shit about your pizza preferences
on the internet I never tell a
soul how much I hate it when you top a pizza
with pineapple because that's just gross and weird
and all that you do is make me fuckin
mad so don't waste the time I don
't have and don't try to make me feel bad with your pineapple
toppings I could talk about every time that you
ruined a good pizza but I'd have an empty line cause
you never listen to me anyway so

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
you always said you were misunder
stood but really you just like
pineapple on your pizza and that's just
not
cool just
le
a ve
me a
