[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for
a long time now it's true
but there's one topping that
I just can't get through
it's the pineapple
it's just not right no way
it doesn't belong on a pie that's what I say oh

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
tastes like a tropicalisk
some fruit that doesn't
belong on my plate
just something I can eat with
a fork and not hate it
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just
like this doo doo do
oh I want something just
like this doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just
like this doo doo do
oh I want something just
like this doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
of old and new ones too
but pineapple on a
pizza that's just not cool
it's a crime against flav
or humanity it
ought to be banned forevermore oh yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
tastes like a tropicalisk
some fruit that doesn't
belong on my plate
just something I can eat with
a fork and not hate it

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like
this doo doo doo doo doo do

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something
just like this doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something
just like this doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
tastes like a tropicalisk
some fruit that doesn't
belong on my plate
just something I can eat with
a fork and not hate it
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
