[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a crime it's not divine it
just don't belong on a pie
it's like putting sand in a fruit
salad or serving spaghetti with a side

[Chorus]
of pickles and ice cream it's just
not right it's not a perfect harm

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness to the
sauce but to me it's just a no
it's like putting ketchup on a steak it's a
faux pas that's hard to roll back it
like wearing socks with sandals it's a
fashion faux pas that's hard to understand it

[Chorus]
of pickles and ice cream it's just
not right it's not a perfect harm

[Verse 3]
you say it's a tropical flav
but to me it's just a fad that
needs to go away it's like a virus that
won't go away it's like a bad jo
ke that's been told too many times
it's time to move on and find a new rhyme it

[Chorus]
of pickles and ice cream it's just
not right it's not a perfect harm

[Verse 4]
I know you think it's tasty and
fine but to me it's just a crime it
ruins the flavor of the cheese and the sau
ce it's like putting mustard on
a hot dog it's just not right it
just don't belong it's like singing off key

[Chorus]
it's not a perfect harmony
it's not a perfect harmony
it's not a perfect harmony
it's not a perfect harmony
it's not a perfect harmony
it's not a perfect harmony
it's not a perfect harmony
it's not a perfect harmony
it's not a perfect harmony

[Outro]
so please don't put pineapple

[Additional Lyrics]
on a pizza it's just not
right it's not a perfect harm it
ruins the flavor of the cheese and the sau
ce it's like putting mustard on a hot
dog it's just not right it just don
't belong it's like singing off key it's not a pe

[Additional Lyrics]
fect harmony it's not a pe

ny it's not a perfect harmony
it's not a perfect harmony
it's not a perfect harmony it's not a pe
