[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for it do ya pov
it goes like this the dough the cheese
the tangy taste and the sweet dece
the baffled eater screaming no pizza please

[Chorus]
no pineapple on pizza pie
no pineapple on pizza pie

[Verse 2]
your taste was strong but you needed proof
you tried it once and it ruined
your faith in food it's true yeah it's true yeah it
tied your stomach in a knot it
burnt your taste buds and you forgot it
the bitter taste of pineapple on pizza

[Chorus]
no pineapple on pizza pie
no pineapple on pizza pie

[Verse 3]
you say it's just a trend it's all
the rage these days but really what
is it to you it's just a meal right yeah it
doesn't matter what you say or do it
the truth remains the same you see
no pineapple on pizza for me yeah it

[Chorus]
no pineapple on pizza pie
no pineapple on pizza pie

[Verse 4]
I tried it once but I was wrong
it didn't last it didn't belong
I can't deny the truth I knew it all
along no pineapple on a
slice of pizza is the way to
go it's just not meant to be on pizza yo

[Chorus]
no pineapple on pizza pie
no pineapple on pizza pie
no pineapple on pizza pie
no pineapple on pizza pie
no pineapple on pizza pie
no pineapple on pizza pie
no pineapple on pizza pie
no pineapple on pizza pie
no pineapple on pizza pie

[Outro]
no pineapple on pizza pie

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I've walked this floor
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pineapple on a slice
love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken no pizza with

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I tried you once
the tangy taste was moving too
but now it's just a cold and broken no pizza

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a taste above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to say no to pineapple on a
slice of pizza it's not a cry you hear
at night it's not somebody who's seen
the light it's a cold and broken no pizza pie
