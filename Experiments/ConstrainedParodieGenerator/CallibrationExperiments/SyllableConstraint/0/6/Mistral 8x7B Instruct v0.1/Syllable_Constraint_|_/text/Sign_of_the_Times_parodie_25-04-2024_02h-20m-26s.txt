[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we
must face this culinary war
pizza's a classic dish we all adore Ï€ day
but pineapple's not meant to
grace its surface evermore

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted defeat before we tried
ham and pineapple on our slice of
heaven's delight we must
avoid the sweet and savory fight
we've tasted defeat before we tried it
on our pizza night

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
reject this monstrosity and
get away from this crime we must get far
from this sinful combo on a
pizza pie we adore so far

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and give it a
thought before you take a bite
remember the classics that
never fail to satisfy our taste
we can meet again somewhere
somewhere far away from this

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted defeat before we tried
ham and pineapple on our slice of
heaven's delight we must
avoid the sweet and savory fight
we've tasted defeat before we tried it
on our pizza night

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
reject this monstrosity and
get away from this crime we must get far from
this sinful combo on a pie
we adore so far away from

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted defeat before we tried
ham and pineapple on our slice of
heaven's delight we must
avoid the sweet and savory fight
we've tasted defeat before we tried it
on our pizza night

[Bridge]
we don't speak enough
about the beauty
of a plain cheese pizza
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on we
must get away from this
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to away away we
got to away away we got
to away away away we
