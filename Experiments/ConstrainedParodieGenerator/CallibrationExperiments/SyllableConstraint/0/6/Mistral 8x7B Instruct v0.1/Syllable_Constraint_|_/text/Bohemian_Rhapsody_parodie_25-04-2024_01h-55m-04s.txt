[Intro]
is this a bad pie or just a delusion
pineapple on pizza causing quite the confusion
look at this monstrosity and take a good
I'm just a poor soul who wants good food for good
easy to please with cheese and bread and meaty bros along with
any way the pizza slices doesn't really matter to me

[Verse 1]
ham and pepperoni
put pineapple on top and ruined my dreamy pizza
ham and pineapple never
a match made in heaven or even in
pizza heaven where I wanna be now
carry on without pineapple and enjoy
as if nothing really matters but good taste to me now

[Verse 2]
time to say goodbye to
pineapple on pizza forever more so goodbye
pizza toppings should be savory and
pineapple is sweet and fruity and not for
pizza toppings no matter how you
twist it and turn it it
doesn't belong on my pizza pie so good

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
see a little slice of pineapple on a
pizza pie and I just wanna scream and shout and say
no to pineapple and yes to pepperoni and sa
ve me from this monstrosity and give me back my pizza pie and say easy come easy go pineapple
we will not let you ruin our pizza
not today not tomorrow not ever no
way we will not let you ruin our
pizza pie with your sweetness no way no way
never never never never let you
ruin our pizza pie with your sweetness no
way no way never never never never let
you ruin our pizza pie
let us enjoy our pizza
without your sweetness no way no way no way no
way never never never
mamma mia let me enjoy my pizza without pineapple
beelzebub has a devil put aside for you for ruining

[Verse 4]
so you think you can add pineapple and ruin
my pizza experience well think again and
oh baby can't do this to me baby
just gotta get away from this pizza place and find

[Outro]
a
pizza place that
serves good pizza without pineapple and know
that nothing really tastes
better than a pizza without
pineapple any way
