[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
please forego
this monster from the deepest
low of culinary faux pas choices
the fungus on the doughy
crust so wrong and yet so right
it's a sin to even think of putting it
on a pizza pie tonight
we'll regret it in the morning light
we'll regret it in the morning light oh
pineapple on pizza

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
pineapple on pizza

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where did it come from and why did
it become a thing to even try it
it's a crime against the taste bud
and always leaves me
wanting something better than this mess tonight
and as I stare at this mon
strosity before me on
the table where good food should reside
like indecision to consume
this bastardization of
a classic dish we all despise tonight
despise tonight oh

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on me
it's not a worthy to
pineapple on pizza
don't waste your time on pineapple on me
it's not a worthy to
pineapple on pizza

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on me
it's not a worthy to
pineapple on pizza
don't waste your time on pineapple on me
it's not a worthy to
pineapple on pizza
don't waste your time on pineapple on me
it's not a worthy to
pineapple on pizza
don't waste your time on pineapple on me
it's not a worthy to
pineapple on pizza

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
pineapple on pizza
I despise it I desp
pineapple on pizza
