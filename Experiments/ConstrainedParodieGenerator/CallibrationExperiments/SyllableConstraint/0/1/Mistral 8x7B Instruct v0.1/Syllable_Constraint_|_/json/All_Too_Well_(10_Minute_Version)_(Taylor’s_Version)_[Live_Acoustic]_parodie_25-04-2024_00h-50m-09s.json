your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nI love you guys so much [/INST]\nParody:\n[Verse 1]\nI took a bite of that pie with pineapple\nmy taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow\nthe slimy fruit mixed with cheese and tomato\nI spit it out and now I'll tell you why\n\n[Verse 2]\nthe sweetness of the pineapple clashes loud and clear\nwith the tangy sauce and savory\nthe texture's all wrong and ruins the cheer\nof a classic slice of pizza pie I fear\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I know it's not a hit\nand it doesn't belong on\na dish that's meant to soothe the soul and fill the\ntummy right\n\n[Chorus]\n'cause there it is again on that poor slice of bread\na monstrosity that should have stayed in bed instead of here\non my plate it sits and ta\ndares me to take another bite\n\n[Verse 3]\ntoppings scattered all around like a messy room scene miss\nbut the pineapple's the culprit that I can't dismiss or miss the\nway it overpowers every other taste and smell and\nleaves me longing for a classic slice instead of this\nexperiment gone wrong that leaves me feeling ill at ease and\nwishing I had just stuck with pepperoni or\nsausage or mushrooms or even plain cheese instead of\nthis disaster that I can't believe I chose to eat\nand now I'm stuck with this regret\nand a half eaten slice that I can't bear\nto take another bite of\nbecause it's just not fair to call this pizza anymore\nit's something else entirely and I can't ab\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I know it's not a hit\nand it doesn't belong on a\ndish that's meant to soothe the soul and fill the\ntummy right and yet here it is\n\n[Chorus]\n'cause there it is again on that poor slice of bread a\nmonstrosity that should have stayed in bed instead of here on\nmy plate it sits and ta\ndares me to take another bite\nbut I won't fall for that trick again and leave it\nbehind and search for something better to fill my belly\nwith instead of this mess\nthat I should have known better than to\n\n[Bridge]\nwell maybe I should have known better than\nto trust a fruit on a sav\nory dish but I was feeling advent\nurous and now i\n'm stuck with this regret and\na half eaten slice that I can\n't bear to take another bite of because it's just not right and\nI'll never make this mistake again and I'll stick to what's tried\nand true instead of this experiment gone wrong\nand I'll remember this lesson\n\n[Verse 4]\ntoppings scattered all around like a messy room scene\nbut the pineapple's the culprit that i\ncan't dismiss or miss the way it overpowers every taste\nand smell and leaves me longing\nfor a classic slice instead of this mess that\nI'm stuck with and I'll never make this mistake again and I'll stick to what\n's tried and true instead of this monstros\nity that I should have known better than\nto trust and I'll learn\nfrom this mistake and move on and find a slice\nthat's worth my time and appetite instead of this\ndisaster that I can't believe I chose to eat and now i\n'm stuck with this regret and a half eaten slice that I can\n\n[Verse 5]\ntime won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by this\nmistake that I made and I'd like to be my old self again but i\n'm still trying to find it after this experience\nof pineapple on pizza that left me\nfeeling sick and disappointed in myself for\nfalling for this trick that I should have known better than\nto trust and I'll keep my old\nscarf from that very first slice that i\n\n[Chorus]\n'cause there it is again on that poor slice of\nbread a monstrosity that should have stayed in bed inst\nead of here on my plate\nit sits and taunts me to take a\nbite but I won't fall for\nthat trick again and leave\nit behind and search for\nsomething better to fill\nmy belly with instead\nof this mess that I can't be\n\n[Verse 6]\nand I was never good at trusting fruits on pizzas but the\npineapple's the culprit that I can't trust\nanymore and did the pineapple to\npping ruin the pizza for you too or am\nI alone in this regret and\ndisappointment that I feel every time i\nthink about this mistake that\nI made and I'll never make again and\nI'll stick to what's tried and true and\nnever fall for this trick\n\n[Outro]\nI learned my lesson and I'll never make this
