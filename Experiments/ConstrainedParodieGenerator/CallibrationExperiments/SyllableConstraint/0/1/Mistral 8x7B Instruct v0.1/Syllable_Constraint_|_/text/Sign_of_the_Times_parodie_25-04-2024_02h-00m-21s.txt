[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we
must face this culinary war
pizza's a classic dish we all adore π day
but pineapple's not meant to
grace its surface evermore

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted defeat before we tried
ham and pineapple on our slice of
heaven's delight π
we've tasted defeat before we tried
ham and pineapple on our slice of
heaven's delight π pie

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we must
face this culinary war pied
we gotta get away from this sinful
topping that just doesn't belong
we gotta get away from

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
break the cycle of this food
fight that's been going on for
years we've tried to justify it but it
never tastes quite right we can
meet again somewhere far

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted defeat before we tried
ham and pineapple on our slice of
heaven's delight π
we've tasted defeat before we tried
ham and pineapple on our slice of
heaven's delight π pie

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we must
face this culinary war pied
we gotta get away from this sinful to
pping that just doesn't belong on
our beloved pizza pies no

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted defeat before we tried
ham and pineapple on our slice of
heaven's delight π
we've tasted defeat before we tried
ham and pineapple on our slice of
heaven's delight π pie

[Bridge]
we don't speak the truth
anymore we
should open up our
minds and see the light
we've been here before
it's just not right it

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on it
it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from this sinful topping
we got to get away from this sinful topping
we got to get away from this
sinful topping we got to get
away from this sinful topping
