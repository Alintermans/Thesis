[Intro]
come on now folks and give an ear to me today

[Verse 1]
taste is key or
so they say that pineapple
should not be on a pizza pie my friend
why don't we leave it at that
nothing to gain
when it mixes with cheese in the
oven's fiery blast it
just can't be defended my friend oh

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just wrong
you know it's not the same as it once
belonged in a salad
it's just wrong as it once was wrong as
it was wrong as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
from your local pizzer
ia saying please no pineapple on
my pizza pie my friend what
kind of topping
is that when tomato sauce and
mozzarella reign supreme
it just can't be redeemed my friend oh oh

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just wrong
you know it's not the same as it once
belonged in a salad
it's just wrong as it once was wrong as
it was wrong as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
stay home and bake your own pizza pie
don't let them fool you with their pineapple lies and
take control of your pizza destiny
no need to follow the crowd when you can lead the way

[Outro]
as
it should be
no pineapple on pizza pie it
should be as it should be
