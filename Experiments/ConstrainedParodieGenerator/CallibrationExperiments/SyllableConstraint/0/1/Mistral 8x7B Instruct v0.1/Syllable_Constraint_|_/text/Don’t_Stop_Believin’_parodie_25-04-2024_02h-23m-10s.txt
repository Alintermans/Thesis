[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and sauce
pineapple's a sin and it should be forbidding
it's got no place on a pizza pie causing

[Verse 2]
a slice in my hand with toppings
ham and pepperoni or just
veggies piled high for a tasty
bite it goes on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights
their hunger searchin' in the night
pizza pies call
cravings just to find flavor hid
in every bite of the

[Verse 3]
working hard to get my fill
everyone wants a tasty
meal paying anything to roll the
dice just one more

[Verse 4]
some will win with a meat
lovers dream some will lose
with pineapple on their plate
oh the meal never ends it goes on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights
their hunger searchin' in the night
pizza pies call
cravings just to find flavor hid
in every bite of the

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't add pineapple
hold on to that feeling
pizza pies call
don't add pineapple
hold on
pizza pies call
don't add pineapple
hold on to that feeling
pizza pies call
