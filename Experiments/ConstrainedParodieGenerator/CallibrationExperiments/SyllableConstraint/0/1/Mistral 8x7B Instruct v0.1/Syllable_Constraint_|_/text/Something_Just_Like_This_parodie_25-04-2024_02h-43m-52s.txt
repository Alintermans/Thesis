[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni and cheese
are toppings tried and true
but pineapple's dece
on pizza it won't
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you wanna go
how far will you dev
I'm not looking for a slice so
extraordinary or odd
just something simple
something I can love
I want something just like this
dish that I can trust and
dish that I can miss and serve

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
this classic margh
I want something just like
this cheesy delight doo doo
dish that I can share with
friends and family
I want something just like
this savory pie doo doo do
dish that I can love and eat

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
but pineapple's a sin
on pizza it won't
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo
I'm not the kind of person who'll approve of

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
her saying where d'you wanna go
how far will you devote
I'm not looking for a slice so
extraordinary or odd
just something simple
something I can love
I want something just like this
dish that I can trust and

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
dish that I can share with
friends and family
I want something just like
this classic margherita do
dish that I can love and
dish that I can eat
I want something just like

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how far will you devote
I'm not looking for a slice so
extraordinary or odd
just something simple
something I can love
I want something just like this
dish that I can trust and
dish that I can miss and serve

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this oh
I want something just like this oh
I want something just like this oh
