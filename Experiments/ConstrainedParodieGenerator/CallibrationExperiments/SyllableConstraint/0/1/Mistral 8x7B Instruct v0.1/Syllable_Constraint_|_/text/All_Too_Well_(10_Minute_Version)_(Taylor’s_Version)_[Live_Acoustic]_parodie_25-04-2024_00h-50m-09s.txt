[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow
the slimy fruit mixed with cheese and tomato
I spit it out and now I'll tell you why

[Verse 2]
the sweetness of the pineapple clashes loud and clear
with the tangy sauce and savory
the texture's all wrong and ruins the cheer
of a classic slice of pizza pie I fear

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's not a hit
and it doesn't belong on
a dish that's meant to soothe the soul and fill the
tummy right

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that poor slice of bread
a monstrosity that should have stayed in bed instead of here
on my plate it sits and ta
dares me to take another bite

[Verse 3]
toppings scattered all around like a messy room scene miss
but the pineapple's the culprit that I can't dismiss or miss the
way it overpowers every other taste and smell and
leaves me longing for a classic slice instead of this
experiment gone wrong that leaves me feeling ill at ease and
wishing I had just stuck with pepperoni or
sausage or mushrooms or even plain cheese instead of
this disaster that I can't believe I chose to eat
and now I'm stuck with this regret
and a half eaten slice that I can't bear
to take another bite of
because it's just not fair to call this pizza anymore
it's something else entirely and I can't ab

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's not a hit
and it doesn't belong on a
dish that's meant to soothe the soul and fill the
tummy right and yet here it is

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that poor slice of bread a
monstrosity that should have stayed in bed instead of here on
my plate it sits and ta
dares me to take another bite
but I won't fall for that trick again and leave it
behind and search for something better to fill my belly
with instead of this mess
that I should have known better than to

[Bridge]
well maybe I should have known better than
to trust a fruit on a sav
ory dish but I was feeling advent
urous and now i
'm stuck with this regret and
a half eaten slice that I can
't bear to take another bite of because it's just not right and
I'll never make this mistake again and I'll stick to what's tried
and true instead of this experiment gone wrong
and I'll remember this lesson

[Verse 4]
toppings scattered all around like a messy room scene
but the pineapple's the culprit that i
can't dismiss or miss the way it overpowers every taste
and smell and leaves me longing
for a classic slice instead of this mess that
I'm stuck with and I'll never make this mistake again and I'll stick to what
's tried and true instead of this monstros
ity that I should have known better than
to trust and I'll learn
from this mistake and move on and find a slice
that's worth my time and appetite instead of this
disaster that I can't believe I chose to eat and now i
'm stuck with this regret and a half eaten slice that I can

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by this
mistake that I made and I'd like to be my old self again but i
'm still trying to find it after this experience
of pineapple on pizza that left me
feeling sick and disappointed in myself for
falling for this trick that I should have known better than
to trust and I'll keep my old
scarf from that very first slice that i

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that poor slice of
bread a monstrosity that should have stayed in bed inst
ead of here on my plate
it sits and taunts me to take a
bite but I won't fall for
that trick again and leave
it behind and search for
something better to fill
my belly with instead
of this mess that I can't be

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at trusting fruits on pizzas but the
pineapple's the culprit that I can't trust
anymore and did the pineapple to
pping ruin the pizza for you too or am
I alone in this regret and
disappointment that I feel every time i
think about this mistake that
I made and I'll never make again and
I'll stick to what's tried and true and
never fall for this trick

[Outro]
I learned my lesson and I'll never make this mistake ag
ain and I'll remember it all too well and I'll stick
to what's tried and true and never fall for this trick again and i
'll remember it all too well and I'll stick
