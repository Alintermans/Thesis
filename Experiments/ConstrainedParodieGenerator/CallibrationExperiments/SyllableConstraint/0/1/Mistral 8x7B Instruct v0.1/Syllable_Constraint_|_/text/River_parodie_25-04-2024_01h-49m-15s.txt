[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with pineapple on his plate
to catch flack sweat jackets and dress
slacks on his breath it's a mistake he
can't take back it's a mess he
made with pineapple on his pizza slice he's a
pest and she just wants to protest and get
rid of it but he insists it's a delicacy she
can't resist it's a chess match she's on his case like a jet pack she
's kept track of all his bad food
choices and guess who just happens to be moving on to
the next dish actually just shit on my last
pizza and she has what my ex lacks she's a rebel with
a cause and I know she's using
me to try to play him I don't care hi suzanne
but I shoulda said bye suzanne after the first bite but tonight
I am not gonna eat that pineapple on
my pizza no way not today not on

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand it
was come sunrise scram now we hug tight and he found
out now she feels deserted and used he left
so what he did it first to her too now how
am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through it's hard
to find the words I'm aloof nervous and sue don't
want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth don't
take it personal I just can't say this in person to you so i
revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners don't have
to be reserved in a booth I just feel
like the person who I'm turning into's irrevers
ible I preyed on you like it's church at the pew and now that i
got you I don't want you took advantage
in my thirst to pursue why do I do
this dirt that I do got pineapple
on my pizza now I can't get rid of it
shoulda knew to use protection before
I bit into your for
bidden fruit fuck I don't want it on mine
it's a crime it's a faux pas it's a sin it's a no no it
'su

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pineapple on
my plate
call
me pineap
ple on my plate we'll let
the river run call me pineapple

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if life was a highway
and pineapple was a crime I'd be swerving in five lane
s at a high rate like I'm slidin' on ice maybe
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
but I made you put pineapple on your
pizza this love triangle left us in a wreck
tangled what else can I say it was fun for
a while but I really woulda loved
your pizza without pineapple on it what
else can I say it was a mistake to put

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
's gonna do is off the truth and
my jokes now are falling like the rain so let the
river run I fucked up
