[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice foot
now in the morning I take a bite
only to find it's

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to love the taste
but now it's just a disgrace
tried to savor every
morsel but it left me weary and
one bite in I realized it
was a mistake I shouldn't
have tried it in the first place my taste bud
screams in protest at this monstrosity

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
ham and pineapple is a sinning
be my savory dish instead
a classic margherita in my stead
for some reason I can't explain
pineapple on pizza is
never a good thing but
that was when I ate pineapple

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild
choice to put pineapple
on pizza but now I realize it
was a mistake I shouldn't have made it
trendsetters wait for my
opinion on pineapple on
pizza but I'm just a man on a lonely
mission to warn others of this cul

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
ham and pineapple is a sinning
be my savory dish instead
a classic margherita in my stead
for some reason I can't explain
pineapple on pizza is never a
good thing but that was when
I ate pineapple on pizza

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
hear the bells of disappointment ring
ham and pineapple is

instead a classic mar
gherita in my stead for some
reason I can't ex
plain pineapple on pizza is never
a good thing but that was
when I ate pineapple on pizza
