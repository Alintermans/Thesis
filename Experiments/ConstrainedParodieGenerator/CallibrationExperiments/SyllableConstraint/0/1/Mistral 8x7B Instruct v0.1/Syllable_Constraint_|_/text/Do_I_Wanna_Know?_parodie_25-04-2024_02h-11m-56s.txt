[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple quite que
on your pizza pie distasteful bile or glee question me
is it sweet or is it sour on your
tongue a war you can'
outlast or does it leave you feeling blue
like anchovies do for me and you know it'
clashes with the marinara
like a bad parlor
trick it just doesn't fit on a savory dish like this should
ever stick to ham and cheese or pepperoni

[Pre-Chorus]
should I take a slice or let it be alone and
are you one to savor every bite or moan and
baby we both know that pineapple's not the way
to go for those who seek a tasty feast

[Chorus]
crawlin' back
to pizza pies without the
sweet attackin
my taste buds
maybe I'm too
set in my ways to
crave for something new now
I've thought it through craw
lin' back to pies that

[Verse 2]
so do you dare admit
that pineapple's got no place on a
pizza pie it's just a silly myth that won
't let go it's time to move on and find a new combo that
won't leave you feelin' like you've been deceived by food again
and again it's time to take a stand and say no more
to pineapple on pizza pies for me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
should I take a slice or let it be alone and
are you one to savor every bite or moan and
baby we both know that pineapple's not the way
to go for those who seek a tasty feast

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to pies that don'
t have pineapple stuck in
between their cheesy
layers maybe I'm too stubborn to
give in to a trend that never should have
started now I've thought it through craw
lin' back to pies that won'
t leave me feelin
betrayed by food no

[Outro]
should I take a slice or let it be alone and
are you one to savor every bite or moan and
baby we both know that pineapple's not the way
to go for those who seek a tasty feast do I want
pizza crawlin' back to you or should I say no way
to pineapple on my pizza pie today baby
we both know that pineapple's not the way to go for me
