[Verse 1]
grab some dough, and call
your friends to stand and braw
for pineapple's a shameful call
nope, no way, it

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the lights on it's clearer to see
why pineapple should not be on
it's gross and ruins the sp
it's a disgrace to the pizza
a pineapple on top so wrong
a pineapple should not belong

[Post-Chorus]
no way hey

[Verse 2]
it's worse than mushrooms or ham
for this sin I'm
blessed to spread the word of no pineap
on pizza we stand till the end

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the lights on it's clearer to see
why pineapple should not be on
it's gross and ruins the sp
it's a disgrace to the pizza
a pineapple on top so wrong
a pineapple should not belong

[Post-Chorus]
no way hey

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why it's there
oh yeah I guess it's just not fair
it's hard to find a reason to
oh well whatever it'

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the lights on it's clearer to see
why pineapple should not be on
it's gross and ruins the sp
it's a disgrace to the pizza
a pineapple on top so wrong
a pineapple should not belong

[Outro]
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial
