[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I'm disgusted
wish I could explain it clearer
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a parody
to tell you why it's clever
do you read my rants
or do you skip my rantments' chance
when you said you'd try it once were
you even in your right mind
I knew when I asked you to reconsider your
choice of toppings you'd refuse to budge
and I'd end up more repulsed than before you said you would try it too
don't say it isn't fair
you clearly weren't aware
that you made me despair so if you really wanna
know why pineapple shouldn't be

[Chorus]
on a pizza I'm disgusted I'm disg
usted wish I could explain it clearer I wish it
wasn't true mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mmmm
mm mm mm mm mm mmmm

[Verse 2]
you call me again and say it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
you scared me to death but I'm wasting my breath
'cause you only listen to your ignorant
friends I don't relate to
you I don't relate to you
'cause I'd never treat a pizza this
shitty you made me hate this

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing you were my pizza to
pping and all that you did was make me sad so
don't waste the time I don't have and
don't try to make me feel bad i
could talk about every time that you said it was okay
but I'd have an empty line cause you never had a
single valid reason why it should stay on top of cheese
never paid any mind to the classic

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone yeah fuck you
ah
goddam
ah
fuck you
fuck you
