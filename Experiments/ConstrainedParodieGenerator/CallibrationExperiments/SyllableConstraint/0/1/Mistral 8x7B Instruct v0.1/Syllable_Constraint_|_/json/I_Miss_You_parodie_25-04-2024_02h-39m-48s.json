And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it, I desp\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nplease forego\nthis fungus on a\ndish that I know well and adore it seems\na topping so vile it just\ndoesn't belong on a pie\nanchovies and mushrooms are fine by me here\nbut pineapple's place is\nnot on a pizza slice it's clear to\nsee that this sweet fruit doesn't\nbelong with the cheese and\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it I desp\nI despise it I desp\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere is the love for the classic\ntoppings we all know and love so well now\nI cannot fathom why this trend\npersists it's\na disgrace to the art of pizza making\nand as I stare at this mon\nstrosity of a meal it\nmakes me question the sanity of\nthose who would dare to put pine on\ntop of a pizza pie it\njust doesn't compute in my mind tonight\ncompute in my mind\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't waste your time on this fungus here it\ndoesn't belong on a\ndish that we hold so dear\n\nI despise it I despise it I despise\nit I despise it don\n't waste your time on this fun\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't waste your time on this fungus here it\ndoesn't belong on a\ndish that we hold so dear\n\nI despise it I despise it I despise\nit I despise it don\n't waste your time on this fun\n\nnote that I tried to keep the same syllable\ncount as the orginal\nand also the same pos\n\ntag sequence as much as possible while still\nmaking sense and getting\nmy point across about\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it I desp\nI despise it I desp\nI despise it I desp\n",
