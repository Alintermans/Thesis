[Intro]
pineapple on pizza pie oh say is

[Verse 1]
once the box was opened wide
cheese and sauce mixed with pineapple
taste and flavor took a
dive off a cliff and

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three bites later I see the regret
on your face as you realize you'll never forget this taste test
you dream of pepperoni before this sweet charade began
you search for savory flavors under the pineapple banished

[Chorus]
was it over when you first saw it there on
your plate next to the bread sticks and marinara
did you take a bite and
wish you could erase it baby was
it over then and is it over now no

[Post-Chorus]
pineapple on pizza

[Verse 2]
when you lost your appetite
red sauce and pineapple
no longer a delight on
your pizza night dismay

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the pineapple chunks
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza sans
pineapple chunks and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think of
ordering pizza without pine
apple chunks just to see you
come running saying you'
ve changed your mind no more pineapple chunks for

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizzas later if
it's got pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably hate her no oh
you dream of pepperoni before this sweet charade began
you search for savory flavors under the pineapple banished

[Chorus]
was it over when you first saw it there on
your plate next to the bread sticks and marin√°ra
did you take a bite and wish you
could erase it baby was it o
ver then and is it over now no oh no

[Post-Chorus]
pineap
ple on pizza oh say
is it
pineapple on

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
the pineapple chunks
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza sans pine
apple chunks and my whispered sigh oh
lord I think of ord
ering pizza without pineap
ple chunks just to see you come
running saying you've changed your mind no
more pineapple chunks for me no no no no

[Outro]
pineapple on pizza
oh say is it over now no no no no no no no no
let's fast forward to three hundred pizzas
later I was hoping you
'd change your mind but no no
no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no
