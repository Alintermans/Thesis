[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
its taste is a cursea bitter
on a dish that's meant
to be cheesier and zestier

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare tell me it's a delicacy

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shocked by the thought of it
served on a dish I love to get it

[Chorus]
pains me to see it on a slice so
disrespectful to the
cheese and pepperoni that I hold
beloved in my heart and

pizza that I can't abide
pain makes me want to reject it and
never accept it as
