[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for it do ya pov
it goes like this the dough the cheese
the tangy taste and the pine'
a combo that leaves a bad taste in your mouth

[Chorus]
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie

[Verse 2]
your taste was strong but you needed proof
you tried it once and it ruined
your appetite for pizza pies truthfully
it weighed you down and left you que
with a stomach ache and regret too
a taste of pineapple on your pizza pie

[Chorus]
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie

[Verse 3]
you say it's just a trend that's in
I don't even like the taste
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a mess of toppings to choose from
just leave the pineapple at home
and enjoy your pizza without the broken

[Chorus]
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie

[Verse 4]
I tried it once it wasn't much
it left a bad taste in my gut so
I'll stick to the classic toppings
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the pizza gods
with nothing on my slice but pepperoni

[Chorus]
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie

[Outro]
pineapple off the pizza pie

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this pizza place I've walked
this floor I used to eat alone before you
and I've seen your pineapple on the slice
love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken pizza pie dream

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
the toppings but now you never show
the pineapple to me do you
and remember when I moved in
the holy pepperoni was moving too and

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot down someone who outd
rew you and it's not a cry that you hear
at night it's not somebody who's seen
the light it's a cold and it's a broken pizza
