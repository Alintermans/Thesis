He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is off\nthe truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with pineapple on his plate\nto catch flack sweat jackets and dress\nslacks on his breath it's a mistake he\ncan't take back it's a mess he\nmade with pineapple on his pizza slice he's a\npest and she just wants to protest and get\nrid of it but he insists it's a delicacy she\ncan't resist it's a chess match she's on his case like a jet pack she\n's kept track of all his bad food\nchoices and guess who just happens to be moving on to\nthe next dish actually just shit on my last\npizza and she has what my ex lacks she's a rebel with\na cause and I know she's using\nme to try to play him I don't care hi suzanne\nbut I shoulda said bye suzanne after the first bite but tonight\nI am not gonna eat that pineapple on\nmy pizza no way not today not on\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is off\nthe truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one night stand turned a two night stand it\nwas come sunrise scram now we hug tight and he found\nout now she feels deserted and used he left\nso what he did it first to her too now how\nam I supposed to tell this girl that we're through it's hard\nto find the words I'm aloof nervous and sue don't\nwant this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth don't\ntake it personal I just can't say this in person to you so i\nrevert to the studio like hole in the wall diners don't have\nto be reserved in a booth I just feel\nlike the person who I'm turning into's irrevers\nible I preyed on you like it's church at the pew and now that i\ngot you I don't want you took advantage\nin my thirst to pursue why do I do\nthis dirt that I do got pineapple\non my pizza now I can't get rid of it\nshoulda knew to use protection before\nI bit into your for\nbidden fruit fuck I don't want it on mine\nit's a crime it's a faux pas it's a sin it's a no no it\n'su\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's pineapple on\nmy plate\ncall\nme pineap\nple on my plate we'll let\nthe river run call me pineapple\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the bridesmaid never the bride hey\nfuck can I say if life was a highway\nand pineapple was a crime I'd be swerving in five lane\ns at a high rate like I'm slidin' on ice maybe\nthat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nbut I made you put pineapple on your\npizza this love triangle left us in a wreck\ntangled what else can I say it was fun for\na while but I really woulda loved\nyour pizza without pineapple on it what\nelse can I say it was a mistake to put\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\n's gonna do is off the truth and\nmy jokes now are falling like the rain so let the\n",
