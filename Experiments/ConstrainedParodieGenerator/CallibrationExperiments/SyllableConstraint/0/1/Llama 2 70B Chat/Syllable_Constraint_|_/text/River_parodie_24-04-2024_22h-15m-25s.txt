[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolish man and made
a pizza that's
a sinful treat that's oh so wrong no pineapple on my pie
been a lover of pizza with cheese and pepperoni
all my sins need a pizza that
feel it washing over me well little one i
don't want to admit

I've been to hawaii and had pineapple
on my pizza and it's
a taste that's just not meant to be it
clashes with the flavors it's just not right
I've tried it with ham and with bacon too but no
pineapple on my pizza that's just not
what I do it's like putting ketchup on a hot dog no
it's not something that I'm into it's just not my scene no pineapple
on my pizza that's just not
what I need it's like a crime against humanity it
just don't make sense it's not something that I can
get down with no pineapple on my pizza that's just not
what I want it's like a pizza
without cheese or sauce it's just not right it's just not what
