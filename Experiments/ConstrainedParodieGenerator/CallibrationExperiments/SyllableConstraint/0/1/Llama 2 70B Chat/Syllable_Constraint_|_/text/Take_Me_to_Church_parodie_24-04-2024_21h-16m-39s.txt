[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the pineapple on top that's the
problem ain't no way to hide it
I should've known better than to
ever put it on my pie in
the first place but now it
stays there taunting me with its sweetness
and making my taste bud
disagree with my stomach
I was born to love p
izza but pineapple don't fit
the bill my church of culinary
purists agrees she tells me
pineapple has no place on a
pizza it's blasph

[Pre-Chorus]
amen a
men amen a

[Chorus]
take my pizza
away from the pineapple lies take my pizza
away from the pineapple lies I'll tell you all
my cravings and you can sharp
en your knife offer me that flavor
less death oh good
pizza let me give you my life take my pizza
away from the pineapple lies take my pizza
away from the pineapple
lies I'll tell you all my cravings and

[Verse 2]
you can sharpen your knife offer me
that flavorless death oh
good pizza let me give you life
if I'm a heathen of
the foodie kind my pizza's the sun
light to keep my taste buds on
my side she demands a sac
rifice drain the whole bottle
get something bubbly somethin
meaty for the main course that's a
fine lookin' pie what

[Chorus]
take my pizza
away from the pineapple lies take my pizza
away from the pineapple lies I'll tell you all
my cravings and you can sharp
en your knife offer me that flavor
less death oh good
pizza let me give you my life take my pizza
away from the pineapple lies take my pizza
away from the pineapple
lies I'll tell you all my cravings and

[Bridge]
no pineapple on top when the meal begins there
is no sweeter taste than our classic pepperoni
in the madness and soil of that culinary
scene only then I am human only then I am

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh a men
a men amen

[Chorus]
take my pizza
away from the pineapple lies take my pizza
away from the pineapple lies I'll tell you all
my cravings and you can sharp
en your knife offer me that flavor
less death oh good
pizza let me give you my life take my pizza
away from the pineapple lies take my pizza
away from the pineapple
lies I'll tell you all my cravings and
