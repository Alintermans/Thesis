[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on my pizza it does not
belong it's just not right it's like putting
ketchup on a hot dog it
just doesn't make sense it's a
crime against humanity it's a travist
y don't they understand
we can't have this on our plate
it's like a nightmare that
won't go away it

I miss you I miss the

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't put pineapple on my pizza you

my head telling me this

don't put pineapple on my pizza you
already ruined it
for me don't waste your
time on me you're already the voice inside
my head telling me this
is wrong this is not right

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss the
way pizza used to be
I miss you I miss the
way pizza used to be
