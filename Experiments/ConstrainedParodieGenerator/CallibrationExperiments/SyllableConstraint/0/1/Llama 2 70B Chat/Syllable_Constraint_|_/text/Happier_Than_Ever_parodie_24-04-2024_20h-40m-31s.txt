[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
it doesn't belong there
it's a flavor that's not

[Verse 1]
give me a break from the heat of the oven give me
a slice that's not covered in
sweet gooey mess that's not what
I want when I'm craving some
cheesy goodness please don't ins
t on putting pineapple on
my pie that's just not what i
need it's like putting ketchup on a hot dog it
just ain't right it's a sin it's a
crime it's a pizza that's not divine it's a no go it's a no no
it's a hell no it's a no
no way jose it's a no
no way jose it's a no no no no no no no
no way jose it's a no no

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime it doesn't belong there it's a flavor that's not
right it's a no go it's a no no it's a hell no it's a no
way jose it's a no no

[Verse 2]
you call me a hater you call me
close minded but I just can't help
it pineapple on pizza is a no go
it's like putting ranch on a taco it
just don't make sense it's like
putting peanut butter on a
hamburger it's just not right it
ain't no way to make it

[Verse 3]

I don't tweet about how much I hate
pineapple on pizza because that's just sad but

go it's a no no it's a hell no it
ain't right it's a no way jose
