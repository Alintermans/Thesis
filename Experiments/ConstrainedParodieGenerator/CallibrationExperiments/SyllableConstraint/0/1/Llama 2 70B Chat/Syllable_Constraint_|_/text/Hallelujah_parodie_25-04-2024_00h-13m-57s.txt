[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a crime it's not divine it
just don't belong on a pie
it's like putting ice cream on
a steak it's just not right it's not nice it's not

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizza it's just

[Verse 2]
you say it's just a topping like pe
ppers or onions but no way man
those are fine but pineapple's a no go it
just don't taste good it's not a
match made in heaven it's more like a
mismatch in a place that's hot below oh no

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizza it's just

[Verse 3]
you say I'm just a hater i
t's just a pizza topping don
't get your undies in a twist but I gotta
speak the truth it's just not right it's not a
fit like a square peg in a round
hole it's just not worth the fight it's not a good

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizza it's just

[Verse 4]
I know you think I'm just a fool
but I know what I like and what's cool
and pineapple on a pizza just don't
make the cut it's like a foul shot
in basketball it's just not what
you want it's not a slam dunk it's not a good

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizza it's just
not worth the trouble it's not a
good combination it's not a
match made in heaven it's more like
a mismatch in a place that's hot
below oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no oh no

[Outro]
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Additional Lyrics]
I know you think I'm just a
fool for not liking pineapple
on a pizza but to me it's just the truth
it's like a bad song that don't ring true
it's like a bad joke that ain't
funny it's just not worth the money it's not a

[Additional Lyrics]
I remember when we used to
eat pizza without pineapple
and it was good it was like a dream come true
but now it's like a nightmare come true
it's like a bad trip that don't
end it's like a bad habit that don't mend it

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a place for pi
neapple on a pizza up above
but to me it's just a no go it's not a
match made in heaven it's more like a no
no in a place that's hot below oh
no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh
