[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie in the oven baking liv
in a kitchen where the flavors are f
aking it's a crime to put pineapple on top
it's a sin to make it stop just a topping

[Verse 2]
a flavor in a sauce so sweet
the cheese is melted can't
be beat but the pineapple
oh how it ruins the treat it goes

[Pre-Chorus]
customers wait
for their order to arrive
their taste buds searching for delight
pizza lovers
living just to find the right slice
hiding somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
working hard to make a pie
everyone wants it by and
by paying extra for a to
pping that just don

[Verse 4]
some will like some will hate
some are born to love pizza
oh the toppings never end
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
customers wait
for their order to arrive
their taste buds searching for delight
pizza lovers
living just to find the right slice
hiding somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that flavor
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on to that flavor
pizza lovers
