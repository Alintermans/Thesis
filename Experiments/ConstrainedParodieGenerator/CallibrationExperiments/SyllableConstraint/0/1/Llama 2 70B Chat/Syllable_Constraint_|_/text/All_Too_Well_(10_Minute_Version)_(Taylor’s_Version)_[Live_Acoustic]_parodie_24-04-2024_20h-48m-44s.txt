[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up and declare

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple on pizza is a crime against taste
a culinary abomination that
can't be defended with reason or grace aut
umn leaves falling down like flavors out of place

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pizza's not the same no
more and I might be okay but my taste buds are
not fine at

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that menu list you
almost ordered it cause you were looking at me wishing it
was something more than just a
topping on a pie but it'

[Verse 3]
photo of a hawaiian pizza on the
counter your stomach was turning red you used to be a little kid
with a big appetite for something sweet and savory in
bed and your mother's telling stories bout the time you
told me bout your cravings and how you thought pineapple belonged
on pizza and I was thinking on the drive home
any time now he's gonna say it's love but it's not
it's just a topping that doesn't belong on a pie and
then you wondered where the flav
or went to as I reached for a slice but all
I felt was disappointment
and you held my unsatisfied stomach in disbelief
check the taste and come back swearing it's the same but it

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the me
we're arguing bout the toppings in the kitchen light down the
stairs I was there I re
member it all too well and there
we are again when nobody had to know you kept
pineapple on pizza like a secret but I kept you
like an oath sacred prayer
and we'd swear to remember it all

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lie
ing here cause I remember it

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my taste
you said if we had been closer in flavor maybe it would have been
fine and that made me want to
die the idea you had of me who was
she a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on
you not weeping in a party bath
room some chef asking me what happened you
that's what happened you
you who charmed my taste buds with sweet and sour
jokes sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the pizza delivery guy all night
willing you to come and he said it's supposed to be fun

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after pineapple days and nights when you made me your
own now you mail back my taste buds and I walk home
alone but you keep my old favorite topping
from that very first bite cause it reminds you of flav
or and it smells like me you
can't get rid of it cause you re

[Chorus]
member it all too well yeah cause there we
are again when I loved you so back before you lost
the one real thing you've e
ver known it was rare I was there
I remember it all too
well wind in my hair you
were there you remember
it all down the stairs you
were there you remember
it all it was rare I was there

[Verse 6]
I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes like
this pineapple on pizza is a crime and
deserves no chance and did the flavor of
the sauce and cheese paint you blue just between us
did the love affair of pizza and
pineapple maim you too cause in this city's bar
ren cold I still remember
the first bite of a pizza that was true
to itself and how it glistened
as it fell I remember it

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well wind in my hair
I was there down the stairs I was there you
remember it all it was rare you
remember it all too well wind in
my hair I was there down the stairs I was there
sacred prayer I was there it was rare you
remember it all too well wind in
my hair I was there down the stairs sac
red prayer I was there it was rare
you remember it all too well wind in
my hair I was there down the stairs you
remember it all too well sacred
prayer I was there it was rare you
remember it all too well wind in too
well down the stairs you were there you re
member it all too well sacred prayer

[Spoken Outro]
