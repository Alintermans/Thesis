we all must face and answer with
a resounding no don't

[Pre-Chorus]
a pizza crust that's just not right it's like putting ketchup
on a steak it's a crime against culinary human rights
let's not forget the cheese that's melted on top it's meant to be
savored not overpowered by a fruit that's not meant to be stopped

[Chorus]
was it over when the pineapple was placed
on the pie was it over when the flavors
clashed was it over when the che
