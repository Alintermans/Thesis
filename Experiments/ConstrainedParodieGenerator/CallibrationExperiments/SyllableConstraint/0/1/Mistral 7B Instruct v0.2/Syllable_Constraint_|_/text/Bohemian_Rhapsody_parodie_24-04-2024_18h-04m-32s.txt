[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping fiasco I'm stuck in a pineapple
slide no escape from this culinary tide
open your eyes look up to the skies and
see I'm just a poor boy I need no sympathy because pine
apple's easy come easy go little high little low any

[Verse 1]
mama just put a slice
on top of my pizza I didn't realize the price we
paid mama pizza life had
just begun but now I've gone and ruined
it mama ooh didn't mean to make you
frown if I'm not back again this time around
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my taste buds have
come pining for the days before this pineapple was
added sends shivers down my tongue body
's aching all the time
goodbye my favorite flavors
I've got to go gotta
leave you all behind and face the truth mama

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouette of a
pizza topping scaramouche scaramouche will
you do the fandango pineapple thunderbolt and
lightning very very disappointing me galileo galileo galileo margherita
but I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
he's just a poor boy from a cheese loving
family spare him his life from this mon
strosity easy come easy go will you
let me go bismillah we will not let
you go bismillah we will not let you go let
him go bismillah we will not let you go let
me go will not let you go will
not let you go will not let you
go never never never never let me go
oh mamma mia mamma
mia let me go pineapple's got a devil put aside for
me for me for me pineapple's got a devil put aside for

[Verse 4]
so you think you can top me with a pineapple
and serve it up with a frown so you think you can
love me and leave me to pine away oh bab

[Outro]

apple paradise anything really tastes
the same anymore pine
