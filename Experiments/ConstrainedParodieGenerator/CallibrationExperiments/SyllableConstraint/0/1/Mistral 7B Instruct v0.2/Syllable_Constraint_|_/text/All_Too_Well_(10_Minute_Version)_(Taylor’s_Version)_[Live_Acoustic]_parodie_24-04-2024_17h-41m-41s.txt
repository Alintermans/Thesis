[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with a slice in hand and
pineapple on it seemed so strange and bizarre
but you left it there on your pizza counter
and now it's spoiling in your fridge

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple's sweet tang and my puzzled gaze collide
we're arguing in the kitchen about this
autumn leaves falling down like a debate in the
midst of our disagreement about this

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
more but I'm not fine at all oh nooohhohoho
'cause there we are

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little kitchen
floor fighting over the pineapple on our pizza pie
wind in my hair I was
there I remember it all too

[Verse 3]
pineapple album on the counter top turning brown and
rotten as we argue on and on and on and on and on and on
and your mother's telling stories about the day we met and
how we used to love our pizza plain and simple
and you told me about your past and how you used to hate pine
apple on your pizza but I thought it was a
joke and now you're tossing me the spatula saying
it's time to make a change and I'm
thinking about the taste and you
holding my hand and saying it's love but it
was just a mistake and now
you're wondering where it went to as I reach for the pine
apple and all I feel is regret and you're holding

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about the pineapple
long enough to forget why we

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light about the pineap
ple on our pizza pie and
wind in my hair I was there I remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was there I remember
it all too well down the
stairs I was there I remember it

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you added pineap
ple and ruined it all
running scared I was there I rem
ember it all too well wind in my hair I was there i
remember it all too well down the stairs I was there I rem
ember it all too well it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you add pineapple to
my pizza pie it's like a betrayal of trust and taste and love and
memories of our past
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needing never loving jewel whose shine reflects on you
not weeping in a party bathroom
some critic asking me what happened you
that's what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self effacing jokes
sipping coffee like you're on a late night show but
then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come and
he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one but

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old slice of pizza from that first
week it's a reminder of a time when we were young
and how it tasted
so sweet and fresh and new but now it

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you added pineapple to our once
perfect pizza pie it
was rare I was there I reme
mber it all too well wind in
my hair I was there wind
in my hair I was there
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all
it was rare I was there I rem

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your toppings stay
the same I'm a chef who's returning half
my ingredients back to the store and now
did the pineapple bruise turn your love
affair blue just between us did the love affair
maim you too I'm a chef who
is returning half my ingredients
back to the store and now did the
pineapple love affair maim you

[Outro]
I love you guys so much just between us did the love aff
air maim you all too well just between us do you rem
ember it all too well just between us I remeber it all
too well wind in my hair I was there wind
in my hair I was there down the stairs
I was there sacred prayer I was there
it was rare you remember it all too well
wind in my hair I was there wind in mi
my hair I was there down the stairs i
was there sacred prayer I was there it
was rare you remember it all
wind in my hair I was there wind in mi
my hair I was there down the stairs i
was there sacred prayer I was there it
was rare you remember it all
wind in my hair I was there wind in mi
my hair I was there down the stairs i
was there sacred prayer I was there it
was rare you remember it all too well wind

[Spoken Outro]
