[Intro]
come on folks gather round and let me say this true

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's flavor's gone wrong
I want you to hold out the slice of your pie
why don't we leave it lying
no more taste bud
when textures clash and ruin
our culinary
and I'm the one who's still trying oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of food we
know it's not the same as it used to
in this world of food we
know it's not the same as it used to
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza lovers all cry out
why are you ordering that pineapple
what's the deal with that sound oh
ringing the bell
and all the chefs come to
save the day with their skills ref
they just want to make it right you know oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of food we
know it's not the same as it used to
in this world of food we
know it's not the same as it used to
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home try new dishes fast internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave the pineapple far behind us all
I don't wanna talk about who's ordering it

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was as it was you
know it's not the same as
