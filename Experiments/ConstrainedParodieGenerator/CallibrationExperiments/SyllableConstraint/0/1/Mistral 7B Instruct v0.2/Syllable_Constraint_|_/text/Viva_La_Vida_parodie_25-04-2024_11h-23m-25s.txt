[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the pie
seas of cheese would rise when I gave
now in the morning I'm
picking pineapples off with

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
feel the shock in pizza lovers' eyes
listen as the crowd would sigh
now the old king is pineapple free and
one minute it was on high
next the toppings closed me in
and I discovered that my pizzas stand
on pillars of controversy and disdain

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear disapproval bells a ringing
pizza purists' voices are singing
be my mirror reflecting truth
my toppings in a foreign stewed
for some reason I can't explain
once you'd gone there was never
never an honest bite
and that was when I ruled the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild trend
blew down the doors to let pineap
shattered toppings and the sound of
pizza purists' disbelief at what had
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a pineapple
just a topping on a lonely string mmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmh
aw who would ever wanna be king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear disapproval bells a ringing
pizza purists' voices are singing
be my mirror reflecting truth
my toppings in a foreign stewed mmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmm
for some reason I can't explain
I know the pizza police won't call
never an honest bite
but that was when I ruled the pie

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]

oh oh oh oh oh oh
my toppings in a foreign stewed mmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmm

won't call my name never an honest
