[Intro]
I think I've made a grave mistake or
placed a fruit on a dish that's a
pineapple on a pizza'
oh pineapple lovers say
you agree

[Verse]
I've ordered pizzas with a twist
pineapple on top instead of blissful mistresses or
oh man what a world this culinar
experiment could stir up a histeria
if I could take it back I'
d do it in a heartbeat but no I'll try it again
pineapple on a pizza creates a
disaster and I don't wanna taste it again oh man
what a world this culinar scene
if I could take it back I'd do it in a heartbeat but
no I'll try it again and again
some like it hot some like it mild but not me
I'll pass on the pineapple please
and you'd have thought that I would let it go and let it be
but my taste buds break up fast and I don
't wanna let it go so in my memory I'll rot it out

[Chorus]
in my memory
in my memory
in my memory I'll rot
in my memory
in my memory I'll rot
in my memory

[Outro]
in my memory
I'll rot I'll rot I'll rot
is my dislike your love
is all of my dislike your love
enjoy
