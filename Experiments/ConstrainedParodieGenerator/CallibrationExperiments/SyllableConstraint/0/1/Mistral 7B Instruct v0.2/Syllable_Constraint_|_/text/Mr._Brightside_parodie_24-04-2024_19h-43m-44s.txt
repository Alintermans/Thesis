[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta keep it cool because I hate the pineap
it started out on a pie but now it's on a pizza
now I'm cringin' inside and my taste buds are diz
now they're savourin' each bite and I'm callin' a
while he's enjoyin' his slice and she's makin' a fa
now they're chewin' and smilin' and
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're touchin' their plates now
they take another bite
let me be
'cause I just can't look at this pineapple
and takin' the scene

[Chorus]
pineapplesity turnin'
swimmin' through savory lies
chokin' on your excuses
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin' me
open up my closed eyes
'cause I'm mr frustr

[Guitar Solo]
