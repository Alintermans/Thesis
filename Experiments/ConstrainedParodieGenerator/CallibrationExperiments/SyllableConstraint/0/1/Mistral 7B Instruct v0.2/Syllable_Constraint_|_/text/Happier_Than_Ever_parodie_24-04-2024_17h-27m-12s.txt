[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
pineapple just isn'

[Verse 1]
give it a try before you judge so harshly dear friend
to taste a new blend of flav
on our savory bread
do you read my recipes
or do you skip the pine
when you said it was a trendy
topping for a gourmet scene
I knew when I asked you to share a slice with me
you'd do the opposite and make me feel
a palate's disgrace instead of glee and harmony so if you
really wanna know the taste
that brings us joy and delight
no pineapple on our pizza pie tonight let
us savor every bite with

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on it shines so
deliciously bright we wish we could explain it right
wish it wasn't a fight but pineapple just isn't right for us
so if you really wanna

[Verse 2]
you call us back with sauce dripping down
your chin and say it's
the perfect blend but we're wastin'
our breath our taste buds
we don't relate to you
we don't relate to you no
'cause we'd never treat our dish
this way you made us hate this

[Verse 3]
and we don't spread rumors about you on the foodie
forums never told anyone
anything but praise for your creations and the
memories we've made but you made us feel so
disappointed and alone so don'
t waste our time we don't have
and don't try to make us feel bad we could talk about the
times you served us on time but we'd have an empty plate
'cause you never did and never paid attention to our
friends and family so we shut them out for

[Outro]
you ruined our perfect
pairing always said you were unique
but made our meal your
own just leave us alone yeah pineapple
get
away
from
our
pizza
