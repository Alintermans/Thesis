[Intro]
is it right to dine with pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once the pie had baked and cool
pineapple on the cheese was a
pizza's rule was broken fool
your palate's new

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later on a
plate I see your face and your frown on unsuspecting neighbors
you crave for my taste before it called you a culinary
traitor you search in every chef's kitchen for something greater

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they added pineapple on
was it wrong when they sliced the ham on top of
my mozzarella and tom
atoe sauce dear in your dream as you passed
out was it over then and is it over

[Post-Chorus]
is it right is it right

[Verse 2]
when you lost control of your
taste buds red sauce white
cheese blue pizza on a boat
your new dish is my clone

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't taste it
there were flashin'
lights at least I had the decen
cy to keep my orders out
of sight only rumors about the
toppings and my sigh
oh lord I think about adding
exotic flavors just to
see you come runnin' and say
the one thing I've been wanting but no no no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred debates later
if it's got pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably hate it dear
you dream of my taste before it called you a culinary trait
or you search in every gourmet's kitchen for something

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they added pineapple on
was it wrong when they sliced the ham on top of
my mozzarella and tom at
toe sauce dear in your dream as you passed
out was it over then and is it over

[Post-Chorus]
is it
right is it right is it
right is
it right is it

[Bridge]
think I didn't taste it
there were flashin' lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my orders out of
sight only rumors about the to
ppings and my sigh oh
lord I think about adding ex
otic flavors just to see
you come runnin' and say the one thing
I've been wanting but no no no no no no

[Outro]
flashin' lights oh lord let
's fast forward to three hundred takeout orders later on a
plate I was hoping you'd be there and say
the one thing I've been wanting
but no no no no no
was it
right was it right was it right was it right was it
