[Verse 1]
have you got a pine in your
eye from this debate on what's right or not this pie called pine
with pineapple on it that's hard to def
ine as tasty or a crime scene
have you no idea that it's not fine
I've dreamt about this issue nearly every night
how many arguments can we
wage over this fruit
'cause there's this joke I found that makes me think of you an' I repeat
until I fall asleep spillin' sauce on my new

[Pre-Chorus]
do we wanna know if our opinions flow
was sorta hopin' that we'd agree to agree
baby we both know that the nights were made for more
than just debating what's in store tomorrow day's a

[Chorus]
scurrying back to
our stance on pineapple
ever thought of
calling a ce
ase when you've had
a few debates we
always do maybe we're too
busy being right
now I've thought it through

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been wondering if your palate's still
open to the sweet and savory blend that
pineapple brings it's just I'm constantly on the fence of
trying to convince you but I don't know if you feel the
same as I do but we could agree if you wanted
to compromise on this issue of pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
do we wanna know if our opinions flow
was sorta hopin' that we'd agree to agree
baby we both know that the nights were made for more
than just debating what's in store tomorrow day's a

[Chorus]
scurrying back to our stance on pine
apple ever thought of call
ing a cease when you've had a
few debates we always do maybe
we're too busy being right to fall for
someone who prefers their pizza
plain now I've thought it through we
could compromise on
pineapple on half

[Outro]
do we wanna know if our opinions flow
was sorta hopin' that we'd agree to agree on
baby we both know that the nights were made for more
than just debating what's in store tomorrow day's a
do we wanna know if our tastes align do you
want me scurrying back to you do you want
pineapple on your pizza too do you want me
