[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the fruit that ruins pizza
the mystery in the kitchen pantry

where you can always find me

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the harmony and I'm so

and as I ponder if it
belongs on the savory

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]

me it's already the

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already

me it's already the voice inside my head
don't add your fruit to
me it's already the
voice inside my head don't add your fruit to
me it's already the
voice inside my head don
t add your fruit to me it's already the
voice inside my head don
t add your fruit to me

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
