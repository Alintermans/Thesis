[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame
truth and my lies now

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he orders up a pizza with a surprise
topping that's bound to raise some eyes
pineapple on it's not a delight
and she just wants to ignite a fight and take
it's a culinary clash like a spicy race
she's kept the tradition of hating it
and guess who just happens to be ordering it tonight
actually just added it to spite her taste and palate
'cause she's a purist with a ref
and you don't mess with a foodie's preference even
I know she's using me to try to change her man
but she's devised some plan to start a food war in the land
knife in hand says our meal's hang
in the balance as we argue and bang pots and pan
so she's been on the web lately searching for new recipes to
try and I know she's using me to try to
change his mind and I don't care hi suz

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a gourmet dish turned into a
two bite stand it was come dine and dash now we hug
he found out now she feels betrayed and used up
'cause he left so what he did it first to her too
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and true
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the kitchen like a hole in the wall diner
don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
is irreversible I preyed on you like it's
pineapple on a pizza night and now that
I got you I don't want you took adv
antage in my craving to pursue
why do I do this act that I do get on the
soapbox and preach my sermon and speech and
pineapple on a pie
'cause now with you in the oven we can't bring
her in this world shoulda known to use protection before we
bit

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame
truth and my lies now are

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's ooh my name's o
pineap
ple
run run run
call me ooh call me o
pineaple run run run run run run run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never
the bride hey pineapple on a pizza
fuck can I say if food was a highway and deceit was
an enclave I'd be swerving in five lanes speeds at
a high rate like I'm slidin' on ice may
be that's why I may have came
at you sideways I can't keep my lies
straight but I made you terminate my baby this
love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
what else can I say it was fun for
a while bet I really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
gonna cause is a pineapple
on a pizza debate that's a shame truth and mine
lies now are falling like
