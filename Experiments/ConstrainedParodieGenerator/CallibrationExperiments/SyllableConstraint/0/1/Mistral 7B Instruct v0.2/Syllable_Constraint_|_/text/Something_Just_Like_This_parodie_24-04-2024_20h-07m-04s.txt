[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
its strange and not so true
ham and pepper on
a pizza's where it's on
but I'm not the kind who'll eat that one thing done wrongly

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you wanna
go how much you wanna
pineapple on a pizza's not
my idea of a laugh
some simple dish that
won't leave me in
a state of dismay and a
pineapple rind in
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
it's not a tale of might
anchovies and olives
on a pizza's where it
belongs but I'm not the kind who'll mix it up

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna pineap
please don't put it on my pie
it's not my idea of
some simple dish that
won't leave me in
a state of dismay and a
pineapple rind in hand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna pine
please don't put it on my pie
it's not my idea of
some simple dish that
won't leave me in
a state of dismay and a
pineapple rind in hand
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
