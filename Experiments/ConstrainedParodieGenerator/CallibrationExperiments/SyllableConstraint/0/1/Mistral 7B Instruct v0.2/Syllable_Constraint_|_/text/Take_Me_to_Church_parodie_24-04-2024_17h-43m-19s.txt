pineapple on a pizza's itch we
I should've objected
if the heavens ever did dec
pineapple's the last true
every sunday's gettin' more ve
a fresh disaster each
we were born picky eaters they said
my kitchen offers no delights
she tells me serve it up alone with
the only paradise I'll know is
when I'm without pineapple
I was born picky but I love
command me to be free

[Pre-Chorus]
ahhh
ahhhh yes indeed

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good lord let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good lord let me give you my life

[Verse 2]

my lover's the gourmet
to keep the palate on my side
she demands a compromise
substitute the ham for something pine
something sweet for the main course that

madness and soil of that sad kitchen scene only then

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh yes inde
yes inde indeed

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good lord let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good lord let me give you my life
