[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza should not be the thing to do
it's a crime against
good taste and decency too oh no

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm revol
in the toppings game I find myself disag
with the
pineapple trend it's just not my scene

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
ain't you tired of the fruit on top
it's a fad that
needs to stop oh please oh please oh please oh

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in the pizza game I find myself longing
for the
classic toppings only please oh please

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the che
crash through the surface where the toppings can't
hurt us we're far from the strange

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the ha ha shallow in
the ha ha shallow in the ha ha
shallow in the ha ha shall
we're far from the strange now oh

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ah ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the che
crash through the surface where the toppings can't
hurt us we're far from the strange

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the ha ha shallow
in the ha ha shallow in the ha
ha ha shallow in the
we're far from the strange now oh
