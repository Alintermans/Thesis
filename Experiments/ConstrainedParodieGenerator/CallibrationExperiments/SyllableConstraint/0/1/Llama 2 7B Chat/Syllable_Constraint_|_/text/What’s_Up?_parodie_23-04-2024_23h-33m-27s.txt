[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
oh no no no no no no no no
it's a crime against cul
nature and good taste too no no
I can't believe they think it's cool to put fruit on
a savory dish like

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out of my head no
and I'm feeling a little peculiar today
and so I wake up in the morning and I step out
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my voice
what's wrong

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey he
hey hey he
I said hey what's wrong no no no
and I say hey hey he
hey hey he
I said hey what's wrong no no no

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I try to
oh my goodness do i
I try all the time
in this pizza shop of
disaster
and I pray oh my good
I pray every single day
for a pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out of my head no
and I'm feeling a little peculiar today
and so I wake up in the morning and I step out
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my voice
what's wrong no no

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey he

I said hey what's wrong no no
and I say hey hey he

[Outro]
twenty five years and my life
still trying to get up that great big hill of
hope for a destination
