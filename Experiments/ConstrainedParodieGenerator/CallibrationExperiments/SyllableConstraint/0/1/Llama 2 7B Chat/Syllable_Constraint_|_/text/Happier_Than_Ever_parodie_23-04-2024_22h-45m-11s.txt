[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
ain't no reason why it
should be on a pizza tonight
I'm happier than e

[Verse 1]
give me a slice to bite into something sweet and ju
to top it all off with a
fresh fruit treat that can'
you read my mind when you put
it on a pizza crust so fine
I knew when I saw it there
was even on the menu
I asked you to add some spice to my life instead
you gave me something that's nice and bright and
I end up more satisfied than I've ever been before don't say
it isn't fair you clearly
weren't aware that you made
me so very happy pineapple on a pizza
ain't no reason why it should

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie ain't no reasonwhy
it should be on a pizza tonight I'm happier
than eve r I knew when I saw it there was even on the men
I asked you to add some

[Verse 2]
you call me again with a smile on
your face and a twinkle in your
eye you're makin' me feel so alive and free
you're the one that I desire in this
life and I can't deny
I relate to you in a way
that I never thought was true and
all that you did was make me

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me feel so sad
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line cause you never did and
never paid any mind to my mother or friends so i
shut them all out for you cause I was a kid

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone yeah pineapp
