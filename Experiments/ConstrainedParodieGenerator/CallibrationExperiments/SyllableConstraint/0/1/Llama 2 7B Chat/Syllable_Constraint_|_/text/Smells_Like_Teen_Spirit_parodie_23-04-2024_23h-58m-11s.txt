[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
it's just not meant to be
it's like a crime against cheese and toppings
oh no I know it's not a good

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pineapple oh how low
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how

[Chorus]
with the toppings high and bright and bold
here we are now with pineapple
I feel like I've been misled and
here we are now with pineapple
a fruit that doesn't belong on
a pizza that's just not right and

[Post-Chorus]
yeah hey ya

[Verse 2]
it's like a sin to put it
on a pie that's meant
to be savored and enjoyed and che
oh no I know it's not a crime

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pineapple oh how low
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how

[Chorus]
with the toppings high and bright and bold
here we are now with pineapple
I feel like I've been misled and
here we are now with pineapple
a fruit that doesn't belong on
a pizza that's just not right and

[Post-Chorus]
yeah hey ya

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
but pineapple lovers insist
it's a taste that they can't miss
I found it hard to resist and
oh well whatever they say is

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pineapple oh how low
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how

[Chorus]
with the toppings high and bright and bold
here we are now with pineapple
I feel like I've been misled and
here we are now with pineapple
a fruit that doesn't belong on
a pizza that's just not right and

[Outro]
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial
