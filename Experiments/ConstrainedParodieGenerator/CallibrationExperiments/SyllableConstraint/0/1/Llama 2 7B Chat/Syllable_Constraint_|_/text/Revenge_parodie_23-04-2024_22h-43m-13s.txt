[Intro]
I think I've found a reason why oh
pineapple shouldn't be
on a pizza pie oh oh oh oh
I think I've found a reason
pineapple

[Verse]
it's the flavor that it brings to
the toppings that it clings to oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
it's the texture that it brings to the
crust that it stings to oh oh oh oh oh oh
it's the sweetness that it brings to
the savory that it pings to oh oh oh oh oh oh
it's the fruit that it brings to the cheese
that it teases to oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
it's the spice that it brings to the
sauce that it prances to oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
it's the pineapple that it brings to
the pizza that it stings to oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
pineapple shouldn't
be on a pizza
pineapple shouldn't be on
a pizza pie oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
pineapple shouldn't

[Outro]
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
