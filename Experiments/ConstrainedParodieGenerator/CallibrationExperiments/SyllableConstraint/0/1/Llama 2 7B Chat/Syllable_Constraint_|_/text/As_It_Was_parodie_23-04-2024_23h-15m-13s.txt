[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza should not be seen or

[Verse 1]
don't put it
it's a fruit that's
not meant to be with cheese and pepperoni
it's a culinary crime scene
can't you see
it's a pizza that'
just doesn't feel right to me
it's a topping that'

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was pineapple
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
it's a flavor
that's just not meant to be on
a pizza that's hot and cheesy and sweet
it's a taste that's just not meant
to be on a
pizza that's meant to be a treat
it's a topping that's just not
meant to be on a pizza like that please

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was pineapple
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go for a pepperoni or sausage
or maybe some mushrooms or olives too but not that
pineapple it's just not the same as it
was back in the day when pineapple was new and fun

[Outro]
so
pineapple
on a pizza should not be seen or
as it was not the same
