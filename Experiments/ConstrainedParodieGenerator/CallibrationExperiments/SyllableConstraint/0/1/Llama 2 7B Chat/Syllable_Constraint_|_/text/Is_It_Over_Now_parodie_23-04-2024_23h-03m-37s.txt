[Intro]
is it a crime to put pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once I had a pie that was
sweet and savory delightful
but then you put pineapple
and ruined the sight

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later
I see your toppings and your crust in disarray oh no no
you dream of my cheese before it melted away like a lie
you search in every topping's bed for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when I put the pineapple
on top of the cheese and sauce and pepperon
I whispered in your ear and
you passed out on the couch and i
wonder if it was over then and is it

[Post-Chorus]
uh huh uh huh uh hu

[Verse 2]
when you put the pineapple
on top of the cheese and
sauce and pepperon I couldn
lost my appetite and

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you
there were pineapple
chunks all over the floor
at least I had the decenc
to keep my pizza nights out of sight
only pineapple
rumors about my taste buds and
my disappointed sighs oh
lord I think about throwing
up the pineapple and jumping off a tall

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later oh no
I see your toppings and your crust in disarray oh no no no no no
you dream of my cheese before it melted away like a lie oh
you search in every topping's bed for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when I put the pineapple
on top of the cheese and sauce and pepperon
I whispered in your ear and you
passed out on the couch and I wonder
if it was over then and is it over
