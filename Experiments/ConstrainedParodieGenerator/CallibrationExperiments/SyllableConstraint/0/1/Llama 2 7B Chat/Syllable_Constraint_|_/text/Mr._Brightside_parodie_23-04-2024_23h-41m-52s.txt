[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza should not be the crime of
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
started out as a topping but now it's a crime scene oh
how did it end up like this it was only a
topping but now it's a topping too much and it
sick to my stomach and it's all in my head
she's got a pineapple on her pizza and it
makes me wanna scream and

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's got a pineapple
and he's got a slice too
let me go
'cause I just can't look it's killin' me and
takin' control of

[Chorus]
jealousy turning pizzas into a
fiery inferno of
choking on the cheese and sau
alibis but it's just the
price I pay for my love of
destiny is calling me
open up my hun

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
I'm comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
started out as a topping but now it's a crime scene oh
how did it end up like this it was only a
topping but now it's a topping too much and it
sick to my stomach and it's all in my head and
it's all in my head and it's all in my
head and it's all in ma

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's got a pineapple
and he's got a slice too
let me go
'cause I just can't look it's killin' me
and takin' control

[Chorus]
jealousy turning pizzas into a
fiery inferno of
choking on the cheese and sau
alibis but it's just the
price I pay for my love of
destiny is calling me
open up my hun
