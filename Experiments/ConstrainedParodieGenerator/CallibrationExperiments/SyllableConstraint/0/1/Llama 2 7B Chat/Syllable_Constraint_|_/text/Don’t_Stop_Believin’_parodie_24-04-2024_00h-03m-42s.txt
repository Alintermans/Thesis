[Verse 1]
just a pineapple on a pizza town girl liv
livin' in a lonely world of cheese and sau
she took the midnight train goin' anywhere but
not to pineapple on a pizza town boy

[Verse 2]
a topping in a smoky o
the smell of sweetness and spice in
for a bite they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the pizza joint
their toppings searchin' in the night
cheese and sauce and
livin' just to find flavor and
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get a slice
everybody wants a to
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more to

[Verse 4]
some will win with pepper
some will lose with onion rings
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the pizza joint
their toppings searchin' in the night
cheese and sauce and
livin' just to find flavor and
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop toppin' hold
on to that flavor town
people don't
stop toppin' hold on to
that flav
town people don
don't stop toppin' hold
on to that flavor town
people don't
