[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings need holy water to wash away the
well little pineapple on a
I don't want to admit to something that's not
if all it's gonna cause

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his neck scratched to catch some
sweat and spice and everything nice
on his breath is pineapple he's a
sex addict and he just wants to exact reven
it's a chess match he's on his back like a jetpack
she's kept track of all his pizza toppings
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually just shredded mozzarella and pepperoni and
she's devised some plan to top
him in the back with a cherry pepperoni and she
has what my ex lacks and I know she's using me
to try to play him but I don't care hi pineapple
but I shoulda said bye pineapp
after the first slice but tonight I am pineapple
pizza should not be on a pizza should not be on a pizza
should not be on a pizza should not be on
a pizza should not be on a pizza

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings need holy water to wash away the
well little pineapple on a
I don't want to admit to something that's not
if all it's gonna cause

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night topping turned a two night to
it was come crust crunch time now we huff and puff
he found out now she feels topped and used and he
left and now how am I supposed to tell this
pizza that we're through it's hard to find the words i
am aloof nervous and sue don't want to hurt but
what you deserve is the truth don't take it personal
I just can't say this in person to you so I revert to the o
studio like hole in the wall diners don't have to be reserved
I just feel like the person who I'm to
pizza that I'm turning into irreversible
I preyed on you like it's church at the pew and now that I got
you I don't want you took advantage in
my thirst to pursue pizza that I do
get on my soapbox and preach my ser
detergent and bleach is burnin the pizza that
we can't bring her in this world shoulda
known to use protection
before I bit into your forbidden to
pizza should not be on a pizza should not be on a pi
za

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings need holy water to wash away the
well little pineapple on a
I don't want to admit to something that's not
if all it's gonna cause

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pepperoni
my name
za
call me pe
za we'll let the river
run pizza should not be on a pi

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the topping never the pie he
fuck can I say if life was a pizza
and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in five lan
speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin on ice maybe
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my toppings
straight but I made you terminate my pie
this love triangle left us in a pizza that
bet I really woulda loved your sauce don'
didn't really wanna abort but
fuck it what's one more topping to tell our
unborn pizza that we're through it's hard to find

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings
need holy
water to wash away the well little
pineapple
I don't want to admit to
something that's not if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now
