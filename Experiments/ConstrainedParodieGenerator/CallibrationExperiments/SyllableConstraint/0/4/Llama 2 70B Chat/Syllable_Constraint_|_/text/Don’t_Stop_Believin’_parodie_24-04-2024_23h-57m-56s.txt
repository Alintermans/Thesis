[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie in the oven baking liv
in a kitchen where the flavors are making
a culinary delight that's oh so divine
but then they went and put pineapple on the

[Verse 2]
a topping that just doesn't quite
belong on a beautiful pie
the flavors clash and the texture
is all wrong it's just not right no need

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t belong up and down the
menu they re searching for a
combination
that s just not there hidin in
the night wrong choices people

[Verse 3]
working hard to make a me
al that s perfect but they
keep on messin with the formula
just one more time

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
hate it some are born to make
a pizza that s just not
right oh the pizza never ends it

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t belong up and down the
menu they re searching for a
combination
that s just not there hidin in
the night wrong choices people

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don t stop believin
hold on to that feelin
toppings people
don t stop believin
hold on
toppings people
don t stop believin
hold on to that feelin
toppings people
