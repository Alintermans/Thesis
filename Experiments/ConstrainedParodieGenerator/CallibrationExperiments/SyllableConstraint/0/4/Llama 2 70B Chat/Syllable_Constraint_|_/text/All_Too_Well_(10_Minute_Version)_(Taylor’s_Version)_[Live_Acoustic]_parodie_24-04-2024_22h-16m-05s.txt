[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up and declare

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple on pizza is a crime against taste
a culinary abomination that
can't be defended with reason or grace aut
umn leaves falling down like flavors out of place

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pizza's not the same no
more and I might be okay but my taste buds are
not fine at

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that menu list you
almost ordered it cause you were looking at me wishing it
was something more than just a
topping on a pie but I stopped

[Verse 3]
photo of a hawaiian pizza on the counter your
stomach was turning green you used to be a little kid with a big
appetite and your mom's telling stories bout you eating all
the toppings off the pie and leaving the crust behind
and you were tossing me the menu like fuck the rules it's time
to rebel against the norms of society
but I was thinking on the drive home any pizza
topping that's not pepperoni is a crime and should be
illegal and then you wonder
where the flavor went to as I reached for the
pepper shaker but all i
felt was shame and you held my flavorless frame I was a
lifeless pizza crust without pepperoni and you

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing bout the toppings in the refrigerator
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept your pineapple pizza a secret but i
kept my pepperoni
pizza a passion sacred flavor

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this pizza was a master
piece till you tore it
all up running scared i
was there I remember it all
too well and you call me up again just to break me like a
promise so casually cruel in the name of being
honest I'm a crumpled up piece of pizza cra
ving some pepperoni lying

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my taste
you said if we had been closer in flavor maybe it would have been
fine and that made me want to
die the idea you had of me who was
she a never needy ever lovely pizza whose shine reflects on you
not weeping in a party bathroom
some pizza delivery guy asking
me what happened you
that's what happened you you who charmed my taste bud
s with self effacing jokes sipping coffee like
you're on a late night show but then he watched me watch the front door all
night willing you to come and he said it's supposed to be

[Verse 5]
fun turning twenty one time won't fly it's like
I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to be my old self again but i
'm still trying to find it after plaid shirt days and night
s when you made me your own now you mail back and
I walk home alone but you keep my old pizza
topping from that very first week cause it reminds you
of innocence and it still
smells like pepperoni you can't

[Chorus]
get rid of it cause you remember it
all too well yeah you remember it all too well wind
in my hair you were there
you remember it all too well
down the stairs you were there you
remember it all too
well it was rare I was
there I remember it
all too well wind in hair
you were there you remember it

[Verse 6]
all too well and I was never good at telling jokes but the
punch line goes I'll get older but your pizza
stays my age from when your hawaiian broke
my taste buds and bones I'm a soldier who's ret
urning half my weight and did the love
affair maim you too cause in this city's barren
cold I still remember the
first slice of pepperoni and how it
glistened as it fell I remem
ber it all too well just between

[Outro]
us did the love affair maim you all too well just between
us do you remember it all too well just between
us I remember it all too well wind in my hair you were there
down the stairs you were there you remember
it all too well it was rare I was
there I remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there you were there down
the stairs you were there you remember it
all too well it was rare you remem
ber it all too well wind in my hair
you were there you were there down the
stairs you were there you remember it all
too well it was rare you remember
it all too well wind in my hair you
were there you were there down the stag
es you were there you remember it all
too well it was rare you remember
it all too well wind in my hair you
were there you were there down the stairs you were there

[Spoken Outro]
I love pizza so much
