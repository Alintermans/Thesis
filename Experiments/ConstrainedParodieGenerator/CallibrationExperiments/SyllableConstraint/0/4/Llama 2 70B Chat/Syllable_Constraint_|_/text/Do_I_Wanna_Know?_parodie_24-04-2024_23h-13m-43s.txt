[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' with glee every bite you take
do you ever get that feelin' that it
just don't belong like a fruit
that's not supposed to be savory and
sticks out like a sore thumb like a hawaiian pizza
are there some flavors up your sle
that you're tryin' to
hide from me have you no idea that it's just not right how
many toppings can you combine before it's just

[Pre-Chorus]
too much do I wanna know if this topping flows
both ways sad to see you go was hopin' that you'd stay
baby we both know that pineapple don't go
with cheese in no way shape or form not today not tom

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to bas
ics ever thought of takin
a bite when it
ain't no crime
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too bus
y bein' a foodie to
fall for somethin
new now I've thought it

[Verse 2]
so have you got the gut
s to take a stand and make a change and
admit that pineapple don't belong on
your pizza plate and if so I wanna know what time it
shuts down the critics and the hate and the shame that comes with it
it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to
make a point and speak my truth but I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
too much do I wanna know if this topping flows
both ways sad to see you go was hopin' that you'd stay
baby we both know that pineapple don't go
with cheese in no way shape or form not today not tom

[Chorus]
if you feel the same as I do but we
could be together if you
wanted to crawlin' back to
you ever thought of callin' when you
ve had a few have I always do we
both know that pineapple don't
belong on pizza maybe
I'm too busy be
in' a foodie to

[Outro]
fall for somethin' new now I've thought it through crawlin
back to basics do I wanna know if this topping
flows both ways sad to see you go was hopin' that
you'd stay baby we both know that pineapple don't
go with cheese in no way shape or form not today not
tomorrow do you want me crawlin' back to you take
a bite and you'll see that it's just not right it's just not right
