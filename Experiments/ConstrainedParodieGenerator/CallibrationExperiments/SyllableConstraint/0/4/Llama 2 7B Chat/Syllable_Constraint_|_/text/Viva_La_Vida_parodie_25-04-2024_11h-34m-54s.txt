I used to crave the taste
of pineapple on my pizza
but now I see the error of the
massive mistake that I've made

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]

now I know that pineapple doesn't belong

never an honest word
will I speak when it comes to pizza to
tops and I know that now
I used to rule the world of pizza
but now I know the truth

my pizza and I can
never abide by that rule no
