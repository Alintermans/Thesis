[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I realized quickly when I took a bite
that pineapple's a culprit that just doesn't fit right
it's time to set things straight

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm taking a slice
just to spit it out and not pay the price
and I feel a little nauseous indeedly so
and so I wake in the morning and I order a
different topping combo and I take a
deep breath and I savor the taste of
no pineapple

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey hey hey no pineap
please on my pizza tray
and I say
hey hey hey no pineapple on

[Bridge]
ooh o
oh
oh no way
ooh o
oh
ooh no way

[Verse 2]
and I tried
oh my gosh did I tried
to give pineapple
a chance on my pie plate
but I pray
oh my gosh do I pray
for a better pizza day sans
the pineapple hate

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm taking a slice
just to spit it out and not pay the price
and I feel a little nauseous indeedly so
and so I wake in the morning and I order a
different topping combo and I take a
deep breath and I savor the taste of
no pineapple

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey hey hey no pine
apple on my pizza
tray and i
said hey hey hey no pineapple
on my pizza slice hey
and I say hey hey hey no pineap
please on the
pizza tray hey hey hey hey hey hey
and I say
hey hey hey no pineapple on
my pizza slice hey hey
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
and I say hey hey
hey hey hey no pineapple on the
pizza tray
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

[Bridge]
ooh o
oh
oh no way

[Outro]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate oh
