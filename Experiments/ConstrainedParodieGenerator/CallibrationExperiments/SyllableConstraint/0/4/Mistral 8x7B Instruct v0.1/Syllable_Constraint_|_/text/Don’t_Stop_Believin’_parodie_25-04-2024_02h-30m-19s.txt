[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and sauce
pineapple's a sin and it should be forbidding
it's got no place on a pizza pie causing

[Verse 2]
a slice in my hand with toppings
ham and pepperoni or just
veggies piled high for a tasty
bite it goes on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
scattered on the street corners
their hunger yearning in the night
pizza ovens
baking dough with delightful to
ppings to satisfy the night

[Verse 3]
working hard to get my fill
pepperoni and mushrooms
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will win with a meat
lovers dream and a crispy
crust while others will weep at
the sight of pineapple on their slice

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
scattered on the street corners
their hunger yearning in the night
pizza ovens
baking dough with delightful to
ppings to satisfy the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't add pineapple
it's a travesty and
pizza lovers
don't add pineapple
it's a
shame to pizza
don't add pineapple
it's a travesty and
pizza lovers
