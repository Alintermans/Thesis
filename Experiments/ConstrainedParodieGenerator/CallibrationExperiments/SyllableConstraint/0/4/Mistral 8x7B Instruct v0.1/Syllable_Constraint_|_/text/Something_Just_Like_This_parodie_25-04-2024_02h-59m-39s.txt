[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni and cheese
are toppings tried and true
but pineapple's dece
on pizza it won't
doo we all agree it's not a fit here on this list

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said where d'you wanna go
how far will you revol
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some exotic thrill or
some strange sweet surprise
just something simple
something I can savor and
some taste I can recall
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo do do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
ham and pineapple's one
I'll pass it up on through
but on a pizza pie
it doesn't have a clue
it's not the kind of topping that I choose to

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much will you revolt and
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some tropical twist or
some strange sweet surprise
just something simple
something I can savor and
some taste I can recall

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo do do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much will you revol
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some exotic thrill or
some strange sweet surprise
just something simple
something I can savor and
some taste I can recall
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
