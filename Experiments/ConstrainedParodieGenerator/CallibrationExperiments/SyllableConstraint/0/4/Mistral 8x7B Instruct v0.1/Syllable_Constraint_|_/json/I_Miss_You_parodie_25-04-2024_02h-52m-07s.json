And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it, I desp\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nplease forego\nthis monster from the deepest\nlow of culinary faux pas choices\nthe fungus on the doughy\ncrust so wrong and yet so right\nit's a sin to even think of putting it\non a pizza pie tonight\nwe'll regret it in the morning light\nwe'll regret it in the morning light oh\npineapple on pizza\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it I desp\npineapple on pizza\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere did it come from and why did\nit become a thing to even try it\nit's a crime against the taste bud\nand always leaves me\nwanting something better than this mess tonight\nand as I stare at this mon\nstrosity before me on\nthe table where good food should reside\nlike indecision to consume\nthis bastardization of\na classic dish we all despise tonight\ndespise tonight oh\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't waste your time on pineapple on me\nit's not a worthy to\npineapple on pizza\n\ndon't waste your time on pineapple on me\nit's not a worthy to\npineapple on pizza\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't waste your time on pineapple on me\nit's not a worthy to\npineapple on pizza\n\ndon't waste your time on pineapple on me\nit's not a worthy to\npineapple on pizza\n\ndon't waste your time on pineapple on me\nit's not a worthy to\npineapple on pizza\n\ndon't waste your time on pineapple on me\nit's not a worthy to\npineapple on pizza\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it I desp\npineapple on pizza\nI despise it I desp\n",
