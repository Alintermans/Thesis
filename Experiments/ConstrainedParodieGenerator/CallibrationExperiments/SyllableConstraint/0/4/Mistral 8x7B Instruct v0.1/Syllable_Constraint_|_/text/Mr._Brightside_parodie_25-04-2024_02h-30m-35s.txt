[Verse]
emerging from my denial and I've been doing
fine without that taste that I've been denying me
a slice of heaven's grace but now it's just confusing me
it's just a slice of pizza with pineapple on
but now I'm feeling queasy and I'm questioning
why they'd put that fruit on something so divine and
it's all in my head and I'm starting to cringe at
the thought of that combo

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're biting and chewing
he's got a pineapple
ring on his
pizza pie and I just can't bear it
it's ruining me

[Chorus]
jealousy turning foodies away from
traditional slices they
should be savoring instead
it's just a crime I can't
forgive them for ruining
my favorite dish and now
I'm mr pineap
