[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping fiasco I'm stuck in this culinary
landslide with no escape from this debate pie
I'm just a simple palate refusing pine
but society insists it's fine and dandy oh pineap
please don't force it on me with a knife in hand pineapple pie

[Verse 1]
mama just put a slice
on top of my pizza so tender and nice but now it
muddles the taste and ruins
my meal mama I didn't mean to make
you disappointed in your choice of to
ppings carry on carry on as if nothing
really matters toppings are just toppings after all ain

spoils the harmony of flavors goodbye

you all behind and face the truth pine
