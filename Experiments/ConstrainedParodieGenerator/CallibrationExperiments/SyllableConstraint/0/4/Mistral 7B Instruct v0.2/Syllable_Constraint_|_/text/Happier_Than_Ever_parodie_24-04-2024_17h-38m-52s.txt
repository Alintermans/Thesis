[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
feeling out of sight when

[Verse 1]
give me a slice or two to ponder something funny
to write a letter to the
pizza chef who's not so bright
do you read my reviews or
do you ignore my recipe
when you said you'd add pineapple
was I even on your plate
I knew when I asked you to spare a thought for me
you'd top it with a ring of pineapple
and I'd end up feeling quite aghast and blue and red and blue and blue
don't say it's not true or
you're just following the trend
you clearly weren't aware that you made me pineap
pleased so if you really wanna

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza pie is
right we're happier than ever tonight wishing for
a simpler life we'd rather live and thrive when pineapple's not
on our pizza pie is

[Verse 2]
you call me again with pineapple
topping on your slice so bold and rude
you spoil my appetite and make me feel so
disgusted by your disregard for the
traditional ways of the
pizza world I don't relate
to you and your strange desire
'cause I'd never add pineapple

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk trash about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's just embarrassing you were my favorite
topping and all that you did was make me feel
disappointed and sad so don't waste
the time I don't have and don't
try to make me feel bad I could talk about every time
that you added pineapple without asking me but
I'd have an empty slice because you never did respect
my preferences or my friends so I shut

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just leave the pineapple off my pizza
leave
mealone
ah
goddam
ah leave
