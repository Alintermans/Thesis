[Intro]
is it right to dine with pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once the pie had baked and cool
pineapple on the cheese was a
pizza's rule was broken fool
your palate's new

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later on a
plate I see your face and your frown on unsuspecting neighbors
you crave for my taste before it called you a culinary
traitor you search in every chef's kitchen for something greater

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they added pineapple on
was it wrong when they sliced the ham on top of
my pepperoni and mozzare
ellas' dream as you passed out in dis
belief was it over then and is it now

[Post-Chorus]
is it right is it right

[Verse 2]
when you lost control of your
pineapple on the tom
ato sauce no longer was
the only one on the

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the controversy
at least I had the decency
to keep my toppings out of
sight only rumors about my love
for traditional
pizzas and my whispered sighs oh
lord I think about adding
exotic flavors just to
see you come running back and say the one thing

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred arguments later oh no
if it's got pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably order it
you dream of my taste before it called you a culinary trait
or you search in every fusion kitchen for something greater

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they added pineapple on
was it wrong when they sliced the ham on top of
my pepperoni and mozzare
ellas' dream as you passed out in dis
belief was it over then and is it now

[Post-Chorus]
is it
right is it right is it
right is
it right is it

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
the controversy
at least I had the decency
to keep my toppings out of
sight only rumors about my love
for traditional
pizzas and my whispered sighs oh
lord I think about adding
exotic flavors just to see you
come running back and say the one thing I've been

[Outro]
come running back and say
the one thing I've been wanting but no no no no no no no
is it right is it right is it right is
it right is it right is it
right is it right is it
right is
it right is it right is it right is it right is
