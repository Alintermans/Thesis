[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I protest against the

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on my pizza it does not
belong it's just not right it's like putting
ketchup on a hot dog it
just doesn't make sense it's a
crime against humanity it's a travist
y don't they understand
we can't have this on our plate
it's like a personal attack on me
and my taste buds they just

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss the
way pizza used to be

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
I long for the days when pizza
was just cheese and sauce and maybe some pe
pperoni or sausage but now
it's all about the
toppings and the more the merrier it seems
but I say no to pineapp
le on my pizza it's just
not right it's like a betrayal of
all that is good and pure in this
world can't we just keep things
simple and the way they're meant to be like
our love for good

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple pizza
you're already the voice
inside my head telling
me it's wrong don't waste your time on pine
apple pizza you're al
ready the voice inside

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple pizza
you're already the voice
inside my head telling
me it's wrong don't waste your time on pineap
ple pizza you're alread
y the voice inside me
head don't waste your time on pineapple pi
zza you're already the
voice inside my head tel
ling me it's wrong don't waste your time on pi
neapple pizza you're alread

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss the
way pizza used to be
I miss you I miss the
way pizza used to be
