[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie in the oven baking liv
in a kitchen where the flavors are making
a culinary delight that's oh so divine
but then they went and put pineapple on the

[Verse 2]
a topping that just doesn't quite
belong on a beautiful pie
the flavors clash and the texture
is all wrong it's just not right no need

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t belong up and down the
menu they re searching for a
combination
that s just not there hidin in
the night wrong choices people

[Verse 3]
workin hard to make a
perfect pie crust flavors that
complement and delight every
bite but then they

[Verse 4]
ruin it with pineapp
le pizza is a work of
art don t ruin it with
fruit that s not meant to be there some

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t belong up and down the
menu they re searching for a
combination
that s just not there hidin in
the night wrong choices people

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don t stop believing
in the beauty of a
perfect pizza
don t stop believing
hold on
to that flavor
don t stop believing
hold on to that feeling
streetlights people
