[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain it clear
it just don't belong

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to collect my thought s on this
I need to express my dis
belief that you'd put that on
a pizza crust with cheese and
sauce it's just not right don't you
see it's like putting spaghetti
on a hot dog it's just not
right it's a crime against culinary art don
't you know that in your heart don't you know
that it's wrong don't you know that it's wrong don't you know that it's wrong
and now I'm singing this song
to let you know that it's wrong
to put pineapple on a pizza it's wrong it's wrong
it's wrong it's wrong it's wrong it's wrong

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain it clear it just don't
belong it just don't belong it just don't belong it
just don't belong it just

[Verse 2]
you call me up and say you'
re hungry and you're thinking pizza
I say okay that sounds good but then you say
you want to put pineapple on it and
I'm like no no no no no
that's not the way to go don't
you know that's not the way
to go don't you know that

[Verse 3]
I don't post my opinions on the internet don
't want to start a fight but when it comes to
pineapple on a pizza I gotta take a
stand and say it's wrong and if you keep doing
it I'll have to take a break from our
friendship because it's just too much for
me to handle it's like you're trying to ruin something good
like a pizza that's supposed to be simple and true
but instead you're making it complicated and weird and
I just can't be a part of that I just

[Outro]
can't be a part of that
you're ruining everything good just
leave pizza alone just leave
pineapple alone just leave me alone
just
leave me
al
one please
just leave
