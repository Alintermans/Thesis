[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up and declare

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple on pizza is a crime against taste
a culinary abomination that
can't be defended with reason or grace aut
umn leaves falling down like flavors out of place

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pizza's not the same no
more and I might be okay but my taste buds are
not fine at

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that menu list you
almost ordered it cause you were looking at me wishing it
was something more than just a
topping on a pie but it'

[Verse 3]
photo of a hawaiian pizza on the
counter your stomach was turning red you used to be a little kid
with a big appetite for something sweet and savory in
bed and your mother's telling stories bout the time you
told me bout your cravings and how you thought pineapple belonged
on pizza and I was thinking on the drive home
any time now he's gonna say it's love but it's not
it's just a topping that doesn't belong on a pie and
I was thinking on the drive home
he's gonna say it's love but it's not it's just
a topping that doesn't fit
check the menu and come back swearing it's the same but it
ain't no hawaiian pizza in sight and then you

[Pre-Chorus]
wondered where it went to as
I reached for my wallet but all
I felt was shame and you held my hand like
you were paying for something that

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing bout pineapple on pizza in the refrig
erator light down the
stairs I was there I remember
it all too well and there we are again when nobod
y had to know you kept pineapple on pizza like a
secret but I kept your
receipe like an oath sacred prayer and

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lie
ing here cause I remember it

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new
hell every time you double cross a
pizza with pineapple on top you said if we had been closer in
taste maybe it would have been
fine and that made me want to die the ide a
you had of me who was she a never needy ever lovely pizza
whose toppings reflect on you not we
eping in a party bathroom some wait
er asking me what
happened you that's what happened you you who char
med my taste buds with flavors so divine sipping
coffee like you're on a late night show but then he watched me watch the
oven all night willing that pizza to come and he said

[Verse 5]
it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one time
won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to be my old
self again but I'm still trying to find it after
plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now
you mail back my toppings and I walk home alone
but you keep my old favorite pizza in mind cause
it reminds you of flavors
innocence and it smells like me you

[Chorus]
can't get rid of it cause you remem
ber it all too well yeah cause there we are again when
I loved pizza so back
before you lost the one real thing
you've ever known it was rare
I was there I remem
ber it all too well wind
in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there you rem

[Verse 6]
ember it all too well it was rare I was there I was there
and I was never good at telling jokes but
the punch line goes I'll get older but your
toppings stay my age from when your pineapple
broke my taste buds and bones I'm a sol
dier who's returning half my weight and did the
twin flame bruise paint you blue just
between us did the love affair maim you
too cause in this city's barren
cold I still remember the first

[Outro]
fall of snow and how it glistened as it fell I remem
ber it all too well just between us did the love af
