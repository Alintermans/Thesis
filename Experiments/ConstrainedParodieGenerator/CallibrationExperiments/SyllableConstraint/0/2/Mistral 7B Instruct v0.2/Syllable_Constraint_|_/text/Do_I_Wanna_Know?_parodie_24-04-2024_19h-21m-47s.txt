[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clings like something in
the middle of your slice and makes
your taste buds recoil and pine for something
more refined than this tropical combination's scheme
how many palates can you keep
'cause there's this dish I found
that makes me think of you somehow an' I serve it on repeat
until I take a bite and cringe at the sight of

[Pre-Chorus]
is it worth the tryin' or just a waste of time
was sorta hopin' for a classic pizza design
we both know that the nights were made for savory
delights that don't leave us askin' why tomorrow

[Chorus]
scrapin' back to pine
ever thought of orderin
when you've had a
few cravings for
something divine
but I always do
maybe I'm too addicted
to the sweet and sav
now I've thought it through

[Verse 2]
have you got the courage

[Pre-Chorus]
is it worth the tryin' or just a waste of time
was sorta hopin' for a classic pizza design
we both know that the nights were made for savory
delights that don't leave us askin' why tomorrow

scrapin' back to pineapple pie again
ever thought of orderin
when you've had a few cravings
'cause I always do scrapin' back to pine
maybe I'm too addicted to the sweet
and savory mix that leaves me
wondering why I ever

now I've thought it through

[Outro]
is it worth the tryin' or just a waste of time
was sorta hopin' for a classic pizza design
we both know that the nights were made for savory
delights that don't leave us askin' why tomorrow
is it worth the tryin' or just a waste of time too
busy bein' addicted to this pineapple pie
ever thought of orderin' something new and different
