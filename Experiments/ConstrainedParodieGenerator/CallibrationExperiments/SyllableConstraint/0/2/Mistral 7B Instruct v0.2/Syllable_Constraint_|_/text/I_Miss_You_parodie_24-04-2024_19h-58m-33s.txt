[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the fruit that ruins pizza
the mystery in the kitchen pantry
the unsuspecting palate
of flavor clash in the pie
we can live like friends if we want it so nice
where you can always find me
and we'll have harmony in our
dinner table scene instead of this fight
we'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the harmony and I'm so
sorry for the pineapple's addition
I can't enjoy my pizza
this sweet and savour
comes creeping on with such intrusion and comm
and as I bite I ponder
the texture and the taste so
discordant in my mouth it seems so
like indecision to
choose a better topping for
this culinary creation tonight
stop this pineapple

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside this
pizza's head I pine for
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside this
pizza's head I pine for

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside this
pizza's head I pine for
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside this
pizza's head I pine for
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside this
pizza's head I pine for
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside this
pizza's head I pine for

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
