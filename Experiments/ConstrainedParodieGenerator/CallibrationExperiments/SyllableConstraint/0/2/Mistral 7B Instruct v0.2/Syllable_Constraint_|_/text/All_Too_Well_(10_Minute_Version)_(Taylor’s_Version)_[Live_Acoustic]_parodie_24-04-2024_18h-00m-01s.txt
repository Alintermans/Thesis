[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with a slice in hand and
pineapple on it seemed so strange and bizarre
but you left it there on your pizza counter
and now it's spoiling in your refrigerate

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple's sweet tang and my puzzled gaze collide
we're arguing in the kitchen about this
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
but I can't picture it after all these

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red because you were looking at that fruit
wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pineapple album on the countertop turning brown and
your face was turning green with every bite you'd taken on your own
and your mother's telling stories about your past obsession
you told me about your past thinking pineapple was
the key to your heart and you were tossing me the slice keys and
we were always skipping town but I was thinking
any time now you'd say it's love but you never called
it what it was until we were dead and gone and buried
check the pulse and come back swearing
it's the same after three months in the grave and
then you wondered where it went
but all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame and
gave me a slice of pineapple to remember it

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
ath sacred prayer and we
would swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you tore it
all up running scared i
was there I remember it all
too well and you call me up again just to break me like a
promise so casually cruel in the name of being
honest I'm a crumpled up piece of paperlying
here cause I remember it all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in taste maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to pine
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever loving jewel whose shine reflects on you or
was I weeping in a party rest
room some actress asking me what happened
you that's what happened
you who charmed my dad with self effacing jokes
sipping coffee like you're on a late night show but
then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come and
he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one but

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old slice from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well yeah

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your toppings stay the same
from when your pineapple broke my skin and
bones I'm a soldier who's returning half your
weight and did the pineapple bruise paint
you blue just between us did the love affair main
you too cause in this city
barren cold I still remember the first
fall of snow and how it glistened
as it fell I remember it

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well wind in my hair
I was there down the stairs I was there sac
red prayer I was there I was there it
was rare you remember it all too
well wind in my hair I was there down the stairs
I was there sacred prayer I was there it
was rare you remember it all too
well wind in my hair I was there down
the stairs I was there sacred prayer
I was there it was rare you remember
it all too well wind in my hair i
was there down the stairs I was there sac
red prayer I was there it was rare
you remember it all too well wind in
my hair I was there down the stairs i
was there sacred prayer I was there it
was rare you remember it all too well wind

[Spoken Outro]
I love pineapple free
