He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover with a twist\nall my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is a\npineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame\ntruth and my lies now\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe orders up a pizza with a surprise\ntopping that's bound to raise some eyes\npineapple on it's not a delight\nand she just wants to ignite a fight and deny\nit's a battle of taste buds and preferences\nshe's kept track of all the disapprovers\nand guess who just happens to be moving on to the side\n'cause she's a purist and can't abide a pineapple on a pizza\n'cause she hates the taste and texture\nand you don't mess with a foodie's preference even\nI know she's using me to try to change his mind\n'cause she's a traditionalist and I'm the pineapple sign\nbut she's devised some plan to make\nhim see the error of his ways and forgo the pine\nknife in hand she says their relationship's at stake now's the time to\ntake a stand and make a stand against the pine\nso she's been on the web lately searching\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover with a twist\nall my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is a\npineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na pizza night turned into a heated\ndiscussion about the toppings we've been debait\ned he found out she felt betrayed and used up\n'cause he added pineapple and she felt abused\nnow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through\nit's hard to find the words I'm aloof and nervous and\nI don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the\ntruth I just can't say this in person to you so I revert\nto the studio like a hole in the wall diner I don't have\nto be reserved in a booth I just feel\nlike the person I'm turning into's irreversib\nle I preyed on your love for tradition and now that I got\nyou I don't want you I took advantage\nin my quest to satisfy my own taste\nwhy do I do this to you I do\nget on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech\npineapple and cheese is burning the wound\n'cause now with your feelings in\nthe mix we can't bring this relationship\nback shoulda known to use protection before I bit into\nyour\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's ooh my name's o\nriver\no\nh river\nrun call me ooh call me\nooh river run river run river\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the outsider in the pizza\nline never the one who's chosen to shine\nfuck can I say if pizza's a highway and pineapple\nis an enclave I'd be swerving in five lanes speeds at\na high rate like I'm sliding on ice may\nbe that's why I may have came\nat you sideways I can't keep my lies\nstraight but I made you terminate our baby\nthis love triangle left us in a wreck tang\nled what else can I say it was fun\nfor a while but I really woulda loved your\nsmile didn't really wanna abort but what\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover with a twist\nall my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align\nwell little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\ngonna cause is a pineapple\non a pizza debate that's a shame truth and mine\n",
