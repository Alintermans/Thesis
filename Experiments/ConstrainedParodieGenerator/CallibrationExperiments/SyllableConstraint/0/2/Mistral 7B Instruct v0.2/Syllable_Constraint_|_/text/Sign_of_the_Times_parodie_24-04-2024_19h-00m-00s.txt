[Verse 1]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
it's a mystery of the
food chain's quirks and twists and turns we
hope you're not the one who ordered up this error
it looks quite odd upon your
pizza pie but it ain't

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems we
can't escape the taste of pineapple
the horror story repe
alses on and on and on and on
we never order right it seems we can
't escape the taste of pine

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta change our menu
we gotta change our menu
just stop your whining it'll be better
they told me that this trend is new
we gotta change our menu

[Verse 2]
just stop your whining let your taste buds fly high
soaring through the savory
skies remember every
bite will be alright we can agree on
a new pizza place somewhere
somewhere far away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems we
can't escape the taste of pineapple
the horror story repe
alses on and on and on and on
we never order right it seems we can
't escape the taste of pine

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta change our menu
we gotta change our menu
stop your whining baby it'll be better
they told me that this trend is new
we gotta change our menu

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems we
can't escape the taste of pineapple
the horror story repe
alses on and on and on and on
we never order right it seems we can
't escape the taste of pine

[Bridge]
we don't discuss the
toppings enough we
should open up before
it's all too much will
we ever learn to
order right it seems

[Outro]
just stop your whining about that pineapple we
gotta expand our
palate we got to expand our palate we
gotta expand our palate we got to get
away from pineapple we got
to get away from pineapple
we got to get away from pine
