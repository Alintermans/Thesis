pineapple just isn'

[Verse 1]
give it a try before you judge so harshly dear friend
to taste a new blend of flav
on our savory bread
do you read my recipes
or do you skip my recipe
when you said you'd try it new with
pineapple on top instead
I knew when I asked you to trust me and try it
you'd do the opposite and ruin the
pizza I'd made with all my care and pride and time and energy spent
I knew when I asked you to

you call me again with your pineap
ple plea in your voice so
sincere but I'm wastin' my time here dear friend
'cause you only listen to your own taste bud

'cause I'd never add pineapple to
my perfect pizza pie and

[Verse 3]
and I don't spread rumors about you on the foodie

pizza night with a passion so strong
so don't waste the time I don't have left dear friend and don
't try to make me feel bad for loving the classics and
the traditional flavors that make our pizza night
perfect and delicious every time and

[Outro]
you ruined our perfect
pizza pie with your pineapple ob
session misunderstood made
all my moments your own just leave me al
one
