[Intro]
is it right to dine with pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once the pie had baked and cool
pineapple on the cheese was a
pizza's rule was broken fool
your palate's new

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later on a
plate I see your face and your frown on unsuspecting neighbors
you crave for my taste before it called you a culinary
traitor you search in every chef's kitchen for something greater

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they added pineapple on
was it wrong when they sliced the ham on top of
my pepperoni and mozzare
ellas' dream as you passed out in dis
belief was it over then and is it now

[Post-Chorus]
is it right is it right

[Verse 2]
when you lost control of your
pineapple on the tom
ato sauce no longer was
the only one on the

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
there were
disapproving eyes at the sight
of my toppings different
only rumors about my taste and
my whispered sighs oh
lord I think about ordering
something plain and simple just
to see you come running back
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred arguments later on a
table I was hoping you'd be there and say the one thing I've been wanting
but no pineapple on the pizza is a no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they added pineapple on
was it wrong when they sliced the ham on top of
my pepperoni and mozzare
ellas' dream as you passed out in dis
belief was it over then and is it now

[Post-Chorus]
is it
right is it right is it
right is
it right is it

[Bridge]

there were disappro
ving eyes at the sight of my to
ppings different only rum
ors about my taste and my whispered
sighs oh lord I think
about ordering something plain
and simple just to see you
come running back and say the one thing
I've been wanting but no no no no no no

[Outro]
