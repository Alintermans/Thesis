[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
its strange and not so true
ham and pepper on
a pizza's where it's on
but I'm not the kind who'll eat that one thing done wrongly

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you wanna
go how much you wanna
pineapple on a pizza's not
my idea of a laugh
some simple dish that
won't leave me in
a state of dismay and a
pineapple aftertaste
just something I can turn to

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
this doo doo doo do
this doo doo doo doo do
I want something just like this do
I want something just like
this doo doo doo do
this doo doo doo doo do
I want something just like this do
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
it's not a classic rule
anchovies and olives
on pizza's where they're found
but I'm not the kind who'd mix those flavors in

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna pineap
please don't put it on my pie
it's not my idea of
a simple dish that
won't leave me in
a state of dismay and a
pineapple aftertaste

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
this doo doo doo do doo do

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
this doo doo doo do
oh I want something just
like this doo doo doo doo doo do
this doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something
just like this doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna pine
please don't put it on my pie
it's not my idea of
a simple dish that
won't leave me in
a state of dismay and a
pineapple aftertaste
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
