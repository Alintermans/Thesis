[Verse 1]
twenty five years with this strange
tryin' to figure out why pineapple on
a pizza is such a
mystery to me and you know I've tried
to understand this bizarre brotherhood of mankind
for the love of pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm taking a bite
just to get it all out what's in my mind
and I feel a little peculiar with each slice
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's the deal

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's the deal with pine
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's the deal with pine

[Bridge]
ooh o

ooh uh u

[Verse 2]
and I pine
oh my goodness do we
we pine all the time
in this kitchen of life
and I ple
oh my goodness do we
we plead every single day
for no pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm taking a bite
just to get it all out what's in my mind
and I feel a little peculiar with each slice
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's the deal with

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's the deal with
pineapple on pizza
and I say

I said hey what's the deal
with pineapple on pizza hey hey

I said hey what's the deal with pineap

twenty five years with this strange
tryin' to figure out why pineapple on
a pizza is such a thing
