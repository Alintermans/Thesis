[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping fiasco I'm stuck in this culinary
landslide with no escape from this debate pie
I'm just a simple palate refusing pine
but society insists it's fine and dandy oh pineap
please don't make me cry if I'm not back again this time

[Verse 1]
papa just put a slice
of pineapple on my pizza pie I resisted but
now it's ruined all my taste
papa life had just begun but now it
tastes like a mistake papa ooh I didn
t mean to make you cringe if I'm not back next
time order something else carry on carry on as if

[Verse 2]
it's too late for my taste
pineapple sends shivers down my palate aching all
the time goodbye my fellow foodies got
to leave you all behind and face the truth pine
apple ooh I don't wanna bite
I sometimes wish I'd picked
a different topping at all pepperon

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little slice of pineapple on
a pizza pie scaramouche scaramouche will you do
the sweet and savory fandango thunderbolt and
lightning makes me cringe galileo galileo galileo margherita magnificento but
I'm just a simple palate refusing pine
apple he's just a simple palate from a
simple palate family spare him his
life from this monstrosity easy come hard
to go will you let me go bismillah
no we will not let you go let him go bismill
ah we will not let you go let me go will not
let you go never never let
me go mamma mia let me
go beelzebub has a topping put aside for
me for me for me pineap
please don't make me go through this again oh mamma mia let
me go I can't take it anymore I just gotta get out

[Verse 4]
so you think you can top me with pineapple and
tomatoes and spices galore oh baby can
't do this to me baby just gotta get out
just gotta get right outta here ooh oh yeah ooh yeah

[Outro]

not this really matters to me any way
the wind blows pineapple
