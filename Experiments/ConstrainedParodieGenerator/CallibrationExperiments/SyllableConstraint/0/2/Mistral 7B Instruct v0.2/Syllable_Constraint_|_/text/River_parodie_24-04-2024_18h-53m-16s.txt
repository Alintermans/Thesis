[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame
truth and my lies now

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he orders up a pizza with a surprise
topping that's bound to raise some eyes
pineapple on it's not a delight
and she just wants to ignite a fight and deny
it's a battle of taste buds and preferences
she's kept track of all the disapprovers
and guess who just happens to be moving on to the side
'cause she's a purist and can't abide a pineapple on a pizza
'cause she hates the taste and texture
and you don't mess with a foodie's preference even
I know she's using me to try to change his mind
'cause she's a traditionalist and I'm the pineapple sign
but she's devised some plan to make
him see the error of his ways and forgo the pine
knife in hand she says their relationship's at stake now's the time to
take a stand and make a stand against the pine
so she's been on the web lately searching

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a pizza night turned into a heated
discussion about the toppings we've been debait
ed he found out she felt betrayed and used up
'cause he added pineapple and she felt abused
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof and nervous and
I don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the
truth I just can't say this in person to you so I revert
to the studio like a hole in the wall diner I don't have
to be reserved in a booth I just feel
like the person I'm turning into's irreversib
le I preyed on your love for tradition and now that I got
you I don't want you I took advantage
in my quest to satisfy my own taste
why do I do this to you I do
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
pineapple and cheese is burning the wound
'cause now with your feelings in
the mix we can't bring this relationship
back shoulda known to use protection before I bit into
your

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame
truth and my lies now are

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's ooh my name's o
river
o
h river
run call me ooh call me
ooh river run river run river

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the outsider in the pizza
line never the one who's chosen to shine
fuck can I say if pizza's a highway and pineapple
is an enclave I'd be swerving in five lanes speeds at
a high rate like I'm sliding on ice may
be that's why I may have came
at you sideways I can't keep my lies
straight but I made you terminate our baby
this love triangle left us in a wreck tang
led what else can I say it was fun
for a while but I really woulda loved your
smile didn't really wanna abort but what

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
gonna cause is a pineapple
on a pizza debate that's a shame truth and mine
lies now are falling like
