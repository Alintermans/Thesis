[Verse 1]
just a small town cook with an unusual dish
pineapple on a pizza causing quite a
a city palate with a taste so bold and free
pineapple on a pizza ruins it for

[Verse 2]
a chef in a crowded kitchen
the scent of sauce and savory
for a bite that's out of the norm
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza purists
waiting in the line at the
their palates searching for delight
cheese lights people
living just to find a taste that
hides in the unexpected

[Verse 3]
struggling to create a
everyone craves a
paying any price for a slice of
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
some are born to savor pine
the pizza debate never
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza purists
waiting in the line at the
their palates searching for delight
cheese lights people
living just to find a taste that
hides in the unexpected

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lightspeople
don't stop believing
hold on
pizza lightspeople
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lightspeople
