[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is
a topping that's just not right in my eyesaid it's a crime
do you ever get that feeling that you
can't shift the tide of disgust
are there some toppings up your sleeve that you
haven't tried to make it more bearable to chewsa
I've dreamt about pineapple on
a pizza being
a nightmare that I can't escape from my dreams to realit
how many secrets can you keep before you give

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from my plate
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for toppings that are great to

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
supermarket to get rid
of this topping
ever thought of
recycling
it's too busy be
too busy bein' wrong to
fall for something new
now I've thought it through

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been wonderin' if your toppings are still
open and I'm sorry to interrupt your
meal with my disgust and distaste for pineapple on a
pizza is a sin that I can't abide by and I'm not
constantly on the cusp of tellin' you how I feel
but I don't know if you feel the same as me

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from my plate
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for toppings that are great to

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the supermarket to
get rid of this topping that
ever thought of recyclin
it's too busy bein' wrong to fall
for something new now I've thought it through and
crawlin' back to the supermart
to get rid of this topping
do I want to know
if this topping flows

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from my plate
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for toppings that are great to
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways to
too busy bein' wrong to fall for
something new now I've thought it through and I'm not too busy
