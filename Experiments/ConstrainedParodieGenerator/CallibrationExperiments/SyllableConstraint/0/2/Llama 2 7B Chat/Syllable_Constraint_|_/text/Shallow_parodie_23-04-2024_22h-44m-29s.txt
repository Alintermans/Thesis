[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza should not be the thing to do
it's a crime against
good taste and decency too oh no

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm revol
in the toppings game I find myself disag
with the
pineapple trend it's just not my scene

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
ain't you tired of the fruit on top
it's a pizza not
a fruit salad give me a break oh no

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in the toppings game I find myself agree
with the
pineapple ban it's just not my scene

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the pineapple

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the toppings ha ha ha
in the toppings la la la la low
in the toppings ha ha ha
we're far from the pineapple

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ah ah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the pineapple

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the toppings ha ha
in the toppings la la la la low
in the toppings ha ha
we're far from the pineapple
