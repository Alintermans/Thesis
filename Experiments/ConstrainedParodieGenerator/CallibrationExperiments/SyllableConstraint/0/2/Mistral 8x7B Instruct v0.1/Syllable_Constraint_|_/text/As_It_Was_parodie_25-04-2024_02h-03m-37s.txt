[Intro]
come on now folks and give an ear to me today

[Verse 1]
taste is key or
so they say that pineapple
should not be on a pizza pie my friends so
why don't we just leave it at
a simple mar
gherita instead my friends and
let's not forget the taste of
fresh tomato sauce and mozzare

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same
as pineapple on a
pizza pie my friends it

[Verse 2]
call the chef and
tell him to forget the pine
apple on my pizza slice my friends or
better yet just send it back
it's not a sweet
treat it's a savory dish so
let's not ruin it with fruit
and let's just keep it classic oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same
as pineapple on a
pizza pie my friends it

[Bridge]
go home and try again with better to
ppings my friends and don't forget the pepperoni
leave the pineapple at the grocery
store it doesn't belong on a pizza pie my friends

[Outro]
in
this world it
's just us and our love for classic
pizza pie my friends it
