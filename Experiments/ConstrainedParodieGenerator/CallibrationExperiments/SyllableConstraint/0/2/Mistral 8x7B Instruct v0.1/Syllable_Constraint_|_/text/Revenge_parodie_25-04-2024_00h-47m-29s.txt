[Intro]
I think I've tried and tried again to
change your mind on pineapple
on pizza's plate it just don't taste
I think it's time to move on
you agree

[Verse]
I've tasted sweet and savory
but pineapple's taste is heresy to me sincerely
oh man what a mess the things I see
if I could change your mind would I insist on
some pineapple chunks on pizza
and you'd have thought I'd let it go and take a bite with ease
but sweet and savory don't belong
and I don't wanna let it go so in my mouth it's wrong
I've tasted sweet and savory
but pineapple's taste is heresy to me sincerely
oh man what a mess the things I see
if I could change your mind would I insist on
some pineapple chunks on pizza
and you'd have thought I'd let it go and take a bite with ease
but sweet and savory don't belong
and I don't wanna let it go so in my mouth it's wrong

[Chorus]
in my mouth it's wrong
in my mouth it's wrong
in my mouth it's wrong wrong wrong
in my mouth it's wrong
in my mouth it's wrong wrong wrong
in my mouth it's wrong

[Outro]
in my mouth it's wrong
I'll spit it out I'll swear
is my taste your curse to
bear the weight of my displeasure
enjoy
