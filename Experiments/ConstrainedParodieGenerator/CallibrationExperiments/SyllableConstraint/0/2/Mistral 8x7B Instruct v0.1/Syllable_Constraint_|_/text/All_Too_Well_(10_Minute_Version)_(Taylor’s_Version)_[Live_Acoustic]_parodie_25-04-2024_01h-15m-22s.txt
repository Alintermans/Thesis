[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow
the slimy fruit mixed with cheese and tomato
I spit it out and now I'm telling you how

[Verse 2]
oh that sweet and savory combination's a trap
it's a monstrosity that should never
have been wrapped in dough and baked in a
oven's heat and served upon a plate like that

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's not right and
that pizza's not the same no
more and I might be okay but I'm not full at
all oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that round plate sitting
you almost gagged and then you started spitting it out cause it
tasted wrong and you were left
wanting something else instead oh

[Verse 3]
toppings scattered on the counter you were shaking your head
you used to love pizza but now you're filled with dread and regret and you
were thinking on the drive home why did I even try it and
then you wondered where the flavor went to as you reached
for a slice of real food instead and you held it in your hand
and you remembered it all too well oh oh oh
and there you are again in the middle of the night
you're dreaming of a pizza without pineapple in sight
with pepperoni and sausage
you remember it all too well oh oh oh
and there you are again when
nobody's looking you're sneaking a slice of pizza that
doesn't have pineapple on it and you savor the

[Pre-Chorus]
taste and you know it's right and
you're so glad you didn't eat that
pizza with pineapple on it and you
forget about it long enough

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that round plate sitting and
you almost gagged and then you started spitting it out cause it
tasted wrong and you were
left wanting something else instead
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
and there you are again in the middle of the night you
dream of a pizza that
doesn't have pineapple on it and

[Bridge]
well maybe you got carried away and
you ordered it without thought
but maybe it's a lesson learned and you
won't make that same
mistake again oh oh
and you call it up again just
to taste it and you savor every bite oh oh oh oh
and you remember it all oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new
hell every time I see pineapple
on a pizza I'm filled with regret and I wonder why I ever
thought it would be a good ide
and you said if we had been closer in taste
maybe it would have been fine and that made me want to cry oh oh oh oh
and the idea you had of me
a lover of all things pizza but not
pineapple oh oh
and you were thinking on the drive home why did
I even try it and then you wondered where the
flavor went to as you reached for a slice of real food instead oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you order pizza without pineapple and
I walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from
that very first slice oh cause it reminds you of a
time when pizza was still good
and you remember it all too well

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that round plate sit
ting and you almost gagged and then you started spitting
it out cause it tasted
wrong and you were left wanting som
ething else instead oh oh
and there you are again
when you loved pizza so
back before pineapple
ruined it all oh oh
wind in your hair you were there oh

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at trying new things but the pineap
ple on a pizza's a mistake I'll never
make again and did the pineapple hurt
you too or was it just me oh oh oh oh
'cause in this city's barren cold I still
remember the first slice of pizza I had that
didn't have pineapple on
it and how it tasted so good oh oh
and I remember it all too
well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro]
just between us the pineapple ruined it all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well oh oh oh oh
wind in your hair you were there oh oh oh
down the stairs you were there oh oh oh
sacred prayer I was there oh oh oh
it was rare you remember it all too well
wind in your hair you were there oh oh oh
down the stairs you were there oh oh oh
sacred prayer I was there oh oh oh
it was rare you remember it
wind in your hair you were there oh oh oh
down the stairs you were there oh oh oh
sacred prayer I was there oh oh oh
it was rare you remember it
wind in your hair you were there oh oh oh
down the stairs you were there oh oh oh
sacred prayer I was there oh oh oh
it was rare you remember it all too well

[Spoken Outro]
I hate pineapple on
