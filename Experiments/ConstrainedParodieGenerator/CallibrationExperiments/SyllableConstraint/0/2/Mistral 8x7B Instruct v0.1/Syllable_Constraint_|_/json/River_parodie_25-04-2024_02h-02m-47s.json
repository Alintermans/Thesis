He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is off\nthe truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with pineapple on his plate\nto catch flack sweat jackets and dress\nslacks on his breath it's a mistake he\nshouldn't have added pineapple to his pizza\nit's a mess she just wants to express her disdain\nand get that pineapple off her pizza\nit's a chess match he's on the defense like a jetpack she\nwon't let it go she's on a mission to remove that pineapple\nfrom his pizza he's devised\na plan to keep it on his pizza she's got a knife in\nhand says their relationship's hangin' by a thread\nso she's been on the net lately says maybe she'll start a\nmovement to get pineapple off\nall pizzas he knows she's using him to try\nto win this battle he doesn't care he says hi to pineapple\nbut he shoulda said bye pineapple after\nthe first slice but tonight he's\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is off\nthe truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one topping pizza turned a no go\nit was pineapple they both said no now he's got\npineapple on his pizza she feels betrayed\nhe left the pineapple on his pizza so\nwhat she says he shouldn't have left it on his pizza\nbut he did it first to her too now how is he to\ntell this girl that they're through it's hard to find the words to say\nhe's aloof nervous and unsure so he reverts to the studio like\nhole in the wall diners don't have to be reserved in a booth he\njust feels like the person who he's turning\ninto's irreversible he preyed on her like it\nwas a feast at the table and now that he's got her he doesn\n't want her took advantage in his thirst to dev\nour her pizza he doesn't want her\nanymore used protection before\nhe bit into her pizza he shoulda knew to\nuse protection before he bit into\nher pizza fuck he's in\ntoo deep now with her in the womb of his heart\nthey can't bring her in this world shoulda knew to use caution\nwith\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's pineapple it\n's\na\nmistake it\n's a sin it shouldn't be\non pizza let the river run call\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the main topping never the side\nfuck can I say if life was a pizza\nand pineapple was an ingredient I'd be swerving\nin five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin' on\nice maybe that's why I can't keep it\noff my pizza it's a mess\nthis love triangle left us in a wreck\ntangled what else can I say it was fun for a\nwhile but I can't keep pineapple on this\npizza anymore fuck it what's one\nmore slice to tell our unborn pizza to\nstay away from pineapple it's a trap don\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\n's gonna do is off the truth and\nmy jokes now are falling like the rain so let the\n",
