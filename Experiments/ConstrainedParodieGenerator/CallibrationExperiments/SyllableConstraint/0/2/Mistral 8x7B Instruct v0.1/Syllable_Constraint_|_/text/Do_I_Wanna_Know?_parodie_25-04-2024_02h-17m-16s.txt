[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple quite que
on your pizza pie distasteful bile or glee question me
is it sweet or is it sour on your
tongue a never ending fightful
dreams of pepperoni delightful ha
unt it on repeat until you fall asleep drunken
stains upon your carpet floor a
ghastly sight
or is it just a simple matter of taste and preference
and not a crime against humanity's pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
should I dare to take a bite and see if I like
would you join me in this sinful act tonight baby
we both know that the cheese and tomato sauce are
meant to be the stars of the show not the fruit of shame

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to pine
ever thought of tryin' it
when you've had a
few slices
maybe I'm too
open minded to
give up on it easily
now I've thought it through
crawlin' back to pine

[Verse 2]
so do you have the nerve
to put pineapple on your pizza slice
and claim it's just as good or even better
than the classic margherita or pepperoni slice
simmer down and take a bite and see the truth unfold before
your eyes a symphony of flavors in harmony
but I don't know if you feel the same as i

[Pre-Chorus]
should I dare to take a bite and see if I like
would you join me in this sinful act tonight baby
we both know that the cheese and tomato sauce are
meant to be the stars of the show not the fruit of shame

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to pine etcetera till
outro fades out with the same
question repeated in a
haunting melody of regret and
longing for something that was never meant
to be on a pizza in the
first place a tragic tale of
pineapple and its
unwanted presence

[Outro]
should I dare to take a bite and see if I like
would you join me in this sinful act tonight baby
we both know that the cheese and tomato sauce are
meant to be the stars of the show not the fruit of shame
do I wanna know if this feeling flows both ways sad
to see pineapple go was sorta hopin' that it
would stay away from my pizza slice baby we both know
