[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for it do ya pov
it goes like this the dough the cheese
the tangy taste and the sweet dece
the baffled chef making this monstros

[Chorus]
pineapple on pizza no no
pineapple on pizza no no

[Verse 2]
your taste was strong but you needed proof
you tried it once and it ruined
your trust in pizzas and their truths she placed it
on your pie and you felt betrayed
the combo failed and the taste decay
ed and from your lips she drew the dismayed no

[Chorus]
pineapple on pizza no no
pineapple on pizza no no

[Verse 3]
you say it's not a sin to add
but to me it seems quite bad yeah
it's not the same with ham or sausages pa
together they just don't blend in right
it's a mistake and it's a sight
for sore eyes and a broken taste bud hallel

[Chorus]
pineapple on pizza no no
pineapple on pizza no no

[Verse 4]
I tried it once but I won't
do it again it's just not worth it
and even though it all went wrong I'll still eat
a classic margherita
with nothing on my slice but tom
ato and mozzarella hallelujah

[Chorus]
pineapple on pizza no no
pineapple on pizza no no
pineapple on pizza no no
pineapple on pizza no no
pineapple on pizza no no
pineapple on pizza no no
pineapple on pizza no no
pineapple on pizza no no
pineapple on pizza no no

[Outro]
pineapple on pizza no no

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I've walked this floor
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pineapple on a slice
it's not a victory march it
's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I tried it too
the taste was off and it didn't
't blend right it's a broken taste bud hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a taste above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to spit at something that outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
