[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni and cheese
are toppings tried and true
but pineapple's dece
on pizza it won't
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you wanna go
how far will you revol
I'm not looking for a pie that
has pineapple involved oh
no superhero
no tropical twist
just something I can eat now
that won't
disappoint my fist oh oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
this classic slice of
heaven doo do
I want something just like this do
I want something just like
this classic slice of
heaven doo doo doo
I want something just like this do
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you wanna go
