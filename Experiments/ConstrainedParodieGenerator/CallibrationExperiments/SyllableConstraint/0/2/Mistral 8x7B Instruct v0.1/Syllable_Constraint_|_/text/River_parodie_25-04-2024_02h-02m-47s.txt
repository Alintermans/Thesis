[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with pineapple on his plate
to catch flack sweat jackets and dress
slacks on his breath it's a mistake he
shouldn't have added pineapple to his pizza
it's a mess she just wants to express her disdain
and get that pineapple off her pizza
it's a chess match he's on the defense like a jetpack she
won't let it go she's on a mission to remove that pineapple
from his pizza he's devised
a plan to keep it on his pizza she's got a knife in
hand says their relationship's hangin' by a thread
so she's been on the net lately says maybe she'll start a
movement to get pineapple off
all pizzas he knows she's using him to try
to win this battle he doesn't care he says hi to pineapple
but he shoulda said bye pineapple after
the first slice but tonight he's

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one topping pizza turned a no go
it was pineapple they both said no now he's got
pineapple on his pizza she feels betrayed
he left the pineapple on his pizza so
what she says he shouldn't have left it on his pizza
but he did it first to her too now how is he to
tell this girl that they're through it's hard to find the words to say
he's aloof nervous and unsure so he reverts to the studio like
hole in the wall diners don't have to be reserved in a booth he
just feels like the person who he's turning
into's irreversible he preyed on her like it
was a feast at the table and now that he's got her he doesn
't want her took advantage in his thirst to dev
our her pizza he doesn't want her
anymore used protection before
he bit into her pizza he shoulda knew to
use protection before he bit into
her pizza fuck he's in
too deep now with her in the womb of his heart
they can't bring her in this world shoulda knew to use caution
with

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pineapple it
's
a
mistake it
's a sin it shouldn't be
on pizza let the river run call

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the main topping never the side
fuck can I say if life was a pizza
and pineapple was an ingredient I'd be swerving
in five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin' on
ice maybe that's why I can't keep it
off my pizza it's a mess
this love triangle left us in a wreck
tangled what else can I say it was fun for a
while but I can't keep pineapple on this
pizza anymore fuck it what's one
more slice to tell our unborn pizza to
stay away from pineapple it's a trap don

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
's gonna do is off the truth and
my jokes now are falling like the rain so let the
river run final thoughts
