[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
ain't no reason why it
should be on a pizza tonight
I'm happier than e

[Verse 1]
give me a slice to bite into something sweet and ju
to top it all off with a
pineapple ring that can't
be beat in a contest of
taste and texture and cheese and to
end it all with a cherry on
top that's not a pineapple
you'll see that it's plain to see that pineapple doesn
ain't no pizza topping for meeeeeyyyeahhhhho
and I wish it wasn't true that pineapple on a pizza could be
cool or funny or even
trendy in any way shape
or form it's just plain wrong and I'll always say so in
every single day and night

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie no reason why it should
be on a pizza tonight I'm happier than e
wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't true mmhmmm ye
ah goddamn ah fuck you yeah

[Verse 2]
you call me a pineapple lover
but I'm just a pizza purist at
heart and soul and taste buds too and I'll never
back down or give in or compromise or
settle for anything less
than the perfect pie and I know
you think I'm crazy but I know
I'm right and you're wrong and that

[Verse 3]
pineapple on a pizza is like ketchup on a hot
dog or ice cream on a shoe it just don
taste right and it's plain to see that pineapple on
a pizza is just plain wrong and I'll never
eat it or even think about it and
you can call me a pineapple fan
but I'm just a pizza fanatic at the end of the day
and I'll keep on fighting for what's right and never give
up in this pineapple pizza battle and I know that
I'll win in the end because I'm right and you

[Outro]
so don't even try to
make me eat it or even think of
it because I won't and
I'll always say no to pineapple on
a
pizza
ah
goddam
fuck you
