[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is a crime scene
can't believe it's not a
disgusting combination of
tastes like a tropical nightmare in my mouth and
I'll never understand the
appeal of putting fruit on

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before but this time it
really takes the cake or should I say pie
we never learn our
mistakes but this one takes the prize and
we'll never get it right no matter how
hard we try and put that

[Chorus]
stop your crying pineapple it's a sign of
the times we gotta get away
from your presence on our plate
it's a crime scene and we gotta get out
of here before it's too late and
we all end up in a food com

[Verse 2]
pineapple on a pizza is like a bad
dream it's just not meant to be
can't shake this feeling of
disgust and unease when I see it on
a pie that's supposed to be
hot and cheesy and savage

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before but this time it
really takes the cake or should I say pie
we never learn our
mistakes but this one takes the prize and
we'll never get it right no matter how
hard we try and put that

[Chorus]
stop your crying pineapple it's a sign of
the times we gotta get away
from your presence on our plate
it's a crime scene and we gotta get out of
here before it's too late and we
all end up in a food coma

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before but this time it
really takes the cake or should I say pie
we never learn our
mistakes but this one takes the prize and
we'll never get it right no matter how
hard we try and put that

[Bridge]
we've tried other toppings
but they never quite
measure up to the dis
gust and disappoint
ment of pineapple
it's like a never

[Outro]
stop your crying pineapple it's a sign of the
times we gotta get a
way from your presence on our plate it's a crime
scene and we gotta get out of here before it
's too late and we all end up in
a food coma and never come
out alive we gotta get out
