[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against humanity somehow
I can't believe they
think it's a good idea to combine
sweet and savory in such a way that's just not right
it's like they're trying to

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out of my headspace
and I'm feeling a little peculiar today
wake up in the morning and step outside in dismay
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my voice
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey he
hey hey he
I said hey what's going on he
and I say hey hey he
hey hey he
I said hey what's going on he

[Bridge]
ooh o

ooh uh u
ooh o

ooh uh u

[Verse 2]
and I tried
oh my goodness me tried
I tried in this so
called a pizza place with
an open
mind and a closed heart and
I prayed every single day
for a pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out of my headspace
and I'm feeling a little peculiar today
wake up in the morning and step outside in dismay
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my voice
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey he
hey hey he
I said hey what's going on
hey hey hey hey hey he
I said he
what's going on hey hey hey he
hey hey hey hey hey he
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey he
hey hey he
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey he
hey hey he
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey he
hey hey hey hey hey he
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey he
hey hey hey hey he
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey he
hey hey he
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey he

[Bridge]
ooh o

[Outro]
pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against humanity somehow
I can't believe they think
