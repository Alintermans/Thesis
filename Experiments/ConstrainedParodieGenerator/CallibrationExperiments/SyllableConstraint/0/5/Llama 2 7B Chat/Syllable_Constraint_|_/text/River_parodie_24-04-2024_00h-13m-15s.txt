[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings need holy water to wash away the
well little pineapple on a
I don't want to admit to something that's not
if all it's gonna cause

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his neck scratched to catch some
sweat and spice and everything nice
on his breath is pineapple he's a
sex addict and he just wants to exact reven
it's a chess match he's on his back like a jetpack
she's kept track of all his pizza toppings
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually just shredded mozzarella and pepperoni and
she's devised some plan to top
him in the back with a cherry pepperoni and she
has what my ex lacks and I know she's using me
to try to play him but I don't care hi pineapple
but I shoulda said bye pineapp
after the first slice but tonight I am pineapple
pizza should not be on a pizza should not be on a pizza
should not be on a pizza should not be on
a pizza should not be on a pizza

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings need holy water to wash away the
well little pineapple on a
I don't want to admit to something that's not
if all it's gonna cause

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night topping turned a two night to
it was come crust crunch time now we hug tight and and
he found out now she feels deserted and used
cause he left so what he did it first to her
too now how am I supposed to tell this pineapple
that we're through it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nerv
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners don
don't have to be reserved in a bo
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
irreversible I preyed on you like it's church at the pier
and now that I got you I don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do I do this dirt that I do
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burnin the wood
cause now with her in the
we can't bring her in this world shoulda knew
to use protection before I bit into your forbidden
pine

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings need holy water to wash away the
well little pineapple on a
I don't want to admit to something that's not
if all it's gonna cause

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pineapple mine
call me
pine
we'll let the
river run pineapple
let the river run pineapple should

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the topping never the pie he
fuck can I say if life was a pizza
and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in five lan
speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin on ice maybe
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my toppings
but I made you terminate my baby
this love triangle left us in a mess tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your che
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more topping to tell our unborn

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings
need holy
water to wash away the well little
pineapple
I don't want to admit to
something that's not if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my toppings
