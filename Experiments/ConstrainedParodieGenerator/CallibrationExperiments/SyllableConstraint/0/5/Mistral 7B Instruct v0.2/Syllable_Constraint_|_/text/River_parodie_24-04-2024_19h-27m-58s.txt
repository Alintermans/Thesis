[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame
so let the sauce simmer

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he orders up a pizza with a surprise
toppings that clash and create a
pineapple on a pizza parad
oxide with those who prefer the traditional
it's a culinary clash like a game of hide
and seek with the anchovies and pineap
please don't be the one to divide us all with your pine
apple on a pizza obsession that's absurd and wildly impol
it's a battle of tastes like
a chess match in the kitchen where we collide and collide
but she's devised a plan to change the game with her
pineapple on a pizza crusade and I have what the
traditionalists lack she loves the
unconventional and you don't mess with a man
's pizza preference even I know that but she's got a scheme to
change the way we taste and I'm along for the
ride with my pineapple on a pizza

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate that's a shame
so let the sauce simmer

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a simple pie turned into a complex
creation it was pepperoni and cheese but
now it's a tropical sensation with a
pineapple on a pizza twist it's a con
fusion of flavors that's hard to explain but I tried
to tell her it's a mistake but she's determined to
persist in her quest for the perfect blend of sweet and sav
ory but now I'm stuck in this pineapple on a pizza rut and it
feels like I've lost control I just want to tell her the truth but how do
I break it to her that her pineapple
on a pizza obsession is driving us apart
now how am I supposed to tell her that we're through it's hard to
find the words I'm aloof and she's upset but
I can't keep my lies straight I just want
to enjoy a simple pizza night
but now I've got this pineapple on a pizza
obsession that's irreversible and
I've taken advantage
of her love for the unconventional and
now I'm the one who's causing the pain why do I do this to
her

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a

so let the sauce simmer

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pineapple on

app
le pizza
run run run run run run
call me pineapple on a pizza

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the trendsetter never the trend
fuck can I say if pizza was a trend
and pineapple was the odd one out I'd be ordering
up a storm with my pineapple on a pizza lead
but that's why I may have came at you side
ways I can't keep my to
ppings straight but I made you terminate the
pineapple on a pizza experiment that
left us in a wreck tangled in our own
pineapple on a pizza debate
what else can I say it was fun for a while
but I really woulda loved your classic smile

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
goes to cause is a pineapple
on a pizza debate that's a shame so let the
sauce simmer I've been a
