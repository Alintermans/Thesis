[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
its strange and not so true
ham and pepper on
a pizza's where it's on
but I'm not the kind who'll eat that one thing done wrongly

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said what's your preference
how much you wanna pers
pineapple on a pizza's not
the choice for me at first i
no exotic fruit
no savory curse
just something simple and pure
someone I can trust and
in this culinary quest

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
this plain and simple
I want something just like
this pizza's profile oh I want
something just like this plain
and simple pizza
I want something just like
this pizza's flavor profile oh
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
its strange and not so true
anchovies and olives
on pizza's where they're on
but I'm not the kind who'll eat that combo all

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said what's your preference how
much you wanna pers pine
pineapple and anchovies not
the choice for me at first i
no sweet and salty
no savory twist
just something simple and pure
someone I can trust and

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
this simple pizza taste oh

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this plain
and simple pizza taste
I want something just
like this pizza's flavor
I want something just like this plain
and simple pizza taste
I want something just
like this pizza's flavor

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where do you wanna
go how much you wanna
risk pineapple on a pizza
not the choice for me at first
no exotic fruit
no savory curse
just something simple and pure
someone I can trust and
in this culinary quest

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this plain
and simple pizza taste oh oh
