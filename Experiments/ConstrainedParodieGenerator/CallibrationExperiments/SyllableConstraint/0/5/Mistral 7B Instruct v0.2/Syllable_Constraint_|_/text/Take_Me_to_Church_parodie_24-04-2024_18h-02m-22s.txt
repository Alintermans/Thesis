[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
he's the joke at a barbeque pit
pineapple on a pizza's itch we
I should've ordered differently
if the food critics ever spoke
pineapple's the last true
every pizza night's getting more
a bitter taste in the
we were born picky eaters they said
my kitchen offers no delight
she tells me serve it up right side down
the only joy I'll be served is when
I'm alone with no pineap
I was born picky but I love
it's on the menu still

[Pre-Chorus]
ahhh mennon
amen mennon

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the good e
my lover's the savior
to keep the palate on my side
she demands a sacrifice
substitute the ham for something sweet
something juicy for the main course
that's a fine lookin' fruit horse
what you got in the fridge door
we've a lot of starvin' veget
that looks appetizing that looks
this is hunger work

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me my deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me my deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life

[Bridge]
no toppings or meats when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter combination than our gentle
in the madness and plate of that sad culinar
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life
