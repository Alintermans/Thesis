[Intro]
I think I've made a grave mistake or
placed a fruit on a dish that's a
pineapple on a pizza error
pineapple's not a savvy
topper choice

[Verse]
I've ordered pies with pineapple
can't pretend that taste buds are malleable or ref
ined palates accept this debas
le fruit on a savory feast or festive
oh man what a world the flavor
combos I hear if I could act on my preference no
would I remove it from the plate and leave
you with a pizza that's just cheese and heat I vehemently
believe in my grave I'll leave it
can't pretend that taste buds are malleable or ref
ined palates accept this debas
le fruit on a savory feast or festive
oh man what a world the flavor
combos I hear if I could act on my preference no
would I remove it from the plate and leave
you with a pizza that's just cheese and heat I vehemently

[Chorus]
in my grave I'll leave
in my grave I'll leave
in my grave I'll leave it be
in my grave I'll leave
in my grave I'll leave it be
in my grave I'll leave

[Outro]
in my grave I'll leave
I'll leave I'll leave it be
is my dislike your joy
is all of my dislike your joy
enjoy
