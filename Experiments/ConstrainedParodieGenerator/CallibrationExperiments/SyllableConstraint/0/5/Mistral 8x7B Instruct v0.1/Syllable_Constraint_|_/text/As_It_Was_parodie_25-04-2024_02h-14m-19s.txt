[Verse 1]

in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same with pine on

[Verse 2]

tell him to forget the pine

with the taste that's not divine

and order up a classic slice
it's sure to hit the spot just

you know it's not the same with pine on
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same with pine on
on a pizza pie it

[Bridge]
go home and try a classic slice instead
don't waste your time on pineapple bread my friends go

[Outro]

in this world
it's just us and pizza to share so
leave the pineapple off
