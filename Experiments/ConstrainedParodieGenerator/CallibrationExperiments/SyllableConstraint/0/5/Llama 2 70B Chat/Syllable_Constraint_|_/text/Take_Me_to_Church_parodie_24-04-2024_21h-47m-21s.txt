my pizza's got a crime
it's the pineapple on top that's the
problem ain't no way to hide it
I should've known better than to
ever put it on my pie in
the first place but now it
stays there taunting me with its sweetness
and making my taste bud
betray my stomach every time
I take a bite on a sunday
afternoon wishing it was something
else that I could blame for my glutton
but it's just pineapple on
pizza and I can't escape
the feeling that it doesn
