[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' while we're out tonight every
single bite makes me feel like I'm cheatin

were just gettin' it right between us two

I found that makes me think of you somehow an' I can't stop
eatin' it until I'm full and satisfied and

[Pre-Chorus]
can we talk about this pineapple on your pie
is it somethin' that you need or just a waste of a
topping that could be used for somethin' better like
mushrooms or olives maybe even peoria

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to pe
ever thought of takin' it
off mightily
cause I canny
too busily
bein' a pizza
purist to try sommersby
