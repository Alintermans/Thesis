[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on aol
but I don't really care for their opinion
it's just not right no matter how
you slice it up or serve it with
it's a flavor that just doesn't fit in with

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 2]
your taste buds may be confused but mine
are not so easily susswein
I need some cheese and tomato sauce not fruit
on my pie that's just the truth I
can't help it if you disagree
pineapple on pizza is just not for me

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 3]
you say I'm closed minded and a
flavor philistine but I don
t care I'll stand before the lord of pizza
with nothing on my tongue but no way man
pineapple doesn't belong an
inch near a slice of mozzarella okay

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 4]
I did my best to give it a
chance but it just doesn't workaday
I couldn't taste it didn't come alive so
I tried to push it to the side
but it's just not something I can
get on board with no matter how hard I tried

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola
hallelujah hialeah
pineapple on pizzeria
hallelujah hysteria
pineapple on paniagua
hallelujah hagiwara
pineapple on pachysandra
hallelujah halimeda

[Outro]
hallelujah hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been to hawai
I know this pizza I walley
I used to live alone before I knew you
and I've seen your flag on the marble arch
love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy dove was moving two
and every breath we drew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who selenite
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
