[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I protest against the

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on my pizza israel
the topping in the oven of despair
the burning sensation in
my mouth that I cannot bear
we can't have a slice of paradise with
pineapple on top ohare
and in the night we'll wish this never
ends we'll wish this never ends pineapple
on pizza nightengale

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor and I'm so
sorry I cannot taste It tonight I
need a pizza that's done right and
always this strange dis
taste comes creeping on so haunting every
time and as I chew I've had
enough of this abuse it
feels like a crime and treason will you
stop this pain tonight stop this pain
tonight pineapple on a
pizza it's just not right tonight iwai
anymore imai

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you
pineapple on pizza it's just notably
the voice inside my head
I miss you iou

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you
pineapple on pizza it's just notably
the voice inside my head
I miss you iou
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you
pineapple on pizza it's just notably
the voice inside my head
I miss you iou

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
