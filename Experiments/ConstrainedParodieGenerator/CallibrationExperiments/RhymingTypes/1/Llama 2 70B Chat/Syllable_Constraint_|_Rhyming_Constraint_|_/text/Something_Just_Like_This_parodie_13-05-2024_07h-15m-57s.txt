[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for
a long time now it's true
I've tried alligator
and chicken too igu
but one topping that
I just can't abide
is pineapple it's just not right it ruins the taste

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no pignataro
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza incomplete
I want something just like pe

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo pettigrew
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo do
I want something just like
pepperoni pe
pepperoni peipu
pepperoni pelekunu
pepperoni kakadu

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
of old and new ones too
the legends andretti
and the myths they flewu
the testaments they told
the moon and its eclipse
but pineapple on pizza it's just not right

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you want to go how
much you want to risk I
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no pignataro
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza incomplete

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like pe
doo doo doo doxology

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo do oahu
doo doo doo doo doo do dobis
doo doo do pettigrew
doo doo kakadu
doo doo do mcadoo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no pignataro
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza incomplete
I want something just like pe

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
