[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza
toppings would pile high and higher
but now it's just a memory slice
cause pineapple overprice

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to be the king
of the pizza scene but now I'm just
a peasant with a slice that
can't compete with the crown pussycat
one minute I held the che
ese next it was aaa
gone with the wind and my dignity too
pillars of salt and pillars of mashalu

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pizza bells a ringin' roman
cavalry choirs are singin' be a
my mirror my slice and shield ma
missionaries in a foreign field a
for some reason I can't explain
once you've gone there's never an
honest slice and that's when
I ruled the pizza world no more

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let the truth
in shattered slices and the sound of
drums people couldn't believe what I'd done
revolutionaries wait
for a pie that's truly gyrate
just a puppet on a lonely string mmmm yeah
who would ever wanna be king of

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pizza bells a ringin' roman
cavalry choirs are singin' be a
my mirror my slice and shield ma
missionaries in a foreign field a
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint pizza won't call my name
never an honest slice
but that was when I ruled the world
