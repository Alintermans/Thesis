[Intro]
is it right to dine with pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once the pie had baked and cool
pineapple on the vanderpool
I savored every rule
but you still wouldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later on a
plate I see your face and your frown on unsuspecting restaur
ants you crave my taste before it called you a culinova
traitor you search in every kitchen for something greater than

[Chorus]
was it wrong when she placed it on your pizza
was it wrong when he added it to my las
agna come here I whispered in
your ear in your dream as you passed out
was it wrong then and is it wrong nowadays

[Post-Chorus]
is it right is it right

[Verse 2]
when you lost control of your
palate red spadafore
white cheese on a cullimore
pineapple's new flavor

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't taste it
there were critics with
their knives at the ready for their
reviews only rumors of
my marinara's sweetness and sigh
oh lord I think I
would leap onto a very tall
pizza place just to see you
come running and say the one
thing I've been wanting but no no no no no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred arguments later on a
table if it's got green peppers I will surmise that you'll probably say
no I crave your taste before it called you a culin nov
a traitor you search in every chef's bed for something greater

[Chorus]
was it wrong when she placed it on your pizza
was it wrong when he added it to my las
agna come here I whispered in
your ear in your dream as you passed out
was it wrong then and is it wrong nowadays

[Post-Chorus]
is it
right is it right is it
islet
right is it right

[Bridge]
think I didn't taste it
there were critics with
their knives at the ready for their
reviews only rumors of
my marinara's sweetness and sigh
oh lord I think I
would leap onto a very tall
pizza place just to see you
come running and say the one thing that
I've been wanting but no no no no no no

[Outro]
flashin' lights oh lord let
us fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later lett
er flashin' lights I was hoping you'd be
there and say the one thing that
I've been wanting but no
babette
is it right is it right is it right is it right
