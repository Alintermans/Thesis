[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple stranglehold
an anomaly in
hawaiI's delight
pizza's bitter pitfall
but I'm not the kind of eater that it fits all right

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a topping
with a tropical twist or
a superhero
a fairytale dish
just something I can turn to
somebody I amish
I want something just rightish

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just rightish
doo doo doo doo do do
doo doo doo do o
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just rightish
doo doo doo doo do dovish

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple stranglehold
an anomaly in
pizza's savory plot
it's a culinary
but I'm not the kind of eater that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go now
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a topping
with a tropical twist or
a superhero
a fairytale dish
just something I can turn to
somebody I amish

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just rightish
I want something just rightish

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just rightish
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do dou
oh I want something just rightish
doo doo doo doo do dou
doo doo doo do o
doo doo doo do depew

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a topping
with a tropical twist or
a superhero
a fairytale dish
just something I can turn to
somebody I amish
I want something just rightish

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just rightish
oh I want something just rightish
oh I want something just rightish
