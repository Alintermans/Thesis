[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clings like something in
the middle of your slice and makes
your taste buds recoil and pine for something
more refined than this tropical combination's scheme
how many palates cancelling
'cause there's this dish I found
that makes me think of food gone wrong an' I serve it on repeat
until I'm full and groan in disbelief at what

[Pre-Chorus]
should I try this combo once again today's test
was sorta hopin' for a taste that wouldn't vex or
displease us both but now I'm second guessing all
the choices made for this culinary disaster

[Chorus]
draggin' back to pine
ever thought of ordering
when aol
I alkaline
'cause I alamein
too committed to
this culinary feline
now I've recombine
draggin' back to pine

[Verse 2]
so have you got the nerve
to add this fruit to savory dishes
and if so I wanna know what compuser
cravings drive you to experiment and serve it up with
a side of skepticism I'm sorry to intrude but it
seems we're constantly on the brink of culinary
disaster but we could be harmonious if

[Pre-Chorus]
should I try this combo once again today's test
was sorta hopin' for a taste that wouldn't vex or
displease us both but now I'm second guessing all
the choices made for this culinary disaster

[Chorus]
you'd care to try this combo once again
ever thought of ordering
when a hunger pellicane
I'm committed to this uniden
tified fusion of sweet and sour and
spice but we could be savory
if you'd dare to entertain
this unlikely du
now I forewomen

[Outro]
should I try this combo once again today's test
was sorta hopin' for a taste that wouldn't vex or
displease us both but now I'm second guessing all
the choices made for this culinary disaster
should I try this combo once again too busy be
ing true to this unconventionality ever
thought of ordering when a hunger pellicane calls out
