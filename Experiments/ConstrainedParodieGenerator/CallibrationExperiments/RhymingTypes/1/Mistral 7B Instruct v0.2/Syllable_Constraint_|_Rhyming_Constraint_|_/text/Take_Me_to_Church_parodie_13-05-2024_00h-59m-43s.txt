[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
he's the joke at a barbeque pit
pineapple on a pizza it
I should've objected sooner
if the food critics ever spoke
pineapple's the last true
every slice gets more roanoke
a bitter masterstroke
we were born with no taste buds they said
my kitchen offers no relief
she tells me serve it up with carefree
the only flavor I'll be left with
is when I'm alone herewith
I was born with no gingerbread
command me to be ref

[Pre-Chorus]
ahhh mennon
mennon ahmann

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a clown at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my mistakes and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you astore
take mehaffey
I'll top it like a clown at the shrine of your vine
I'll tell you my mistakes and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you mazor

[Verse 2]
if I'm a foodie of the good times
my lover's the savior
to keep the palate on my side
she demands a sacrifice
chop up the ham and get something sweet
something spicy for the main course
that's a fine lookin' ensource
what you got in the pantry
we've a lot of star vincente
that looks appetizing deplete
this is hunger work

[Chorus]

I'll tell you my mistakes and you can sharpen your
offer me my deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you mazor

[Bridge]
no masters or kings when the culinary starts
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle mar
in the madness and soil of that sad kitchen scene
only then I am human only then I ameen

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a clown at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my mistakes and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you astore
take mehaffey
I'll top it like a clown at the shrine of your vine
I'll tell you my mistakes and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you mazor
