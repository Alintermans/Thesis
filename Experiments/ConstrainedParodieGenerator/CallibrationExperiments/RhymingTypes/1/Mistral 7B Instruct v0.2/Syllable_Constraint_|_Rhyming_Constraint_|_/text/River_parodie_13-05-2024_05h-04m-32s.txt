[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza controversy a
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 1: Eminem]
it's a food fight in the kitchen heated and
spiced up with a pineapple on
it's a recipe for a debate
and he's the chef with the plate in his handeland
she's the critic with a palate that hinterland
on his pizza pie there's a mystery
and she just wants to start a culinary warfare and
it's a battle of taste buds in a flavor clashback and forth we go
she's got a passion for the
traditional ways and he's got a love for the avant
but she's got a plan to change the game beforehand
she's been on the web lately saying pineapple's the new
gourmet sensation to spite her
man and I know she's using me to try to play him
but I'm a fan of the sweet and savory blend and I say hey
hi suzanne but I shoulda said sephardim
after the first bite but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza controversy a
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a classic dish turned into a fusion
it was come dinnertime scram but we hug tight and
he found out now she feels betrayed and used up
'cause he left so what he did it first to her too
now how am I supposed to tell this cook that hebrew
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous andrew
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person tofu
so I revert to the studio like a hole in the wall deli
don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
is irreversible I preached on you like it's aouzou
and now that I got you I don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do I do this toshiharu
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
pineapple and cheese is burning the wound
'cause now with her in the wom
we can't bring her in this world shoulda knew
to use protection before I bit into your forbidden
top

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza controversy a
truth and my lies now are

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pineapple mine
river
pine
apple run
call me pineapple shine
pineapple run river weathington

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if pizza picante
and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in five tastes
speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice maybe
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
but I made you terminate myslinski
this love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one
apolline
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
goes to cause is a pineapple
on a pizza controversy ailurophile
truth and mycenaean
