[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret fruit
that didn't belong on wintermute
but you don't really care for taste I betta
it goes like this the first the sixth
the bitter fall the sweetest lift
the puzzled chef composing his regretful

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 2]
your pizza was fine but you needed
proof no pineapple inverted
her toppings in the oven overthrew ya
you sliced the pepperoni and
you shredded the cheese in handeland
and from your plate she drew the hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 3]
you say I argued in vain with
my palate I don't even
know the name of this disdain but if I did
there's a harmony in every word
it doesn't matter inquired
the gourmet or the traditional hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 4]
I tried to please with every
topping I could think oflaherty
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of cu
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Outro]
hallelujah pineapple free

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this table larimore
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pepperoni on the
marble arch love isabella
it's not a cry that you hear at night it's not some

[Additional Lyrics]
someone who's seen the light it's a
cold and it's a broken halla
pineapple free hallelujah pineapple
free hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me
know what's really going onni
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you the
gourmet dove was moving too andy
and every bite we drew was hallelujah
