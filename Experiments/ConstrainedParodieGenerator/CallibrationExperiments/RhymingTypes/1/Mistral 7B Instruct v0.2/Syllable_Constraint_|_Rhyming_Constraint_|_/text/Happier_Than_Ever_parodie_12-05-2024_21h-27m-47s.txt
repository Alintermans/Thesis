[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler night
pineapple schiferon

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to ponder something funny
to write myself aponte
a recipe that suits us
do you read my reviews now
or do you skip my menu's av
when you said you'd try chebrikov
was our pizza even
on your takeout list that day I knew ivanov
I asked you to be chill about chazov
but you'd add it anyway and I'd cringe in dismay oh gillinov
and I'd end up more dismay
don't say it's okay kom
you clearly weren't aware that you made me dismay
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us ightightightightight
our pizza's better than everrightightightight
wishing for a simpler nightwish it wasn't true odelet
we could explain it better

[Verse 2]
you call me again with sauce on your
kielbasa in hand under the inf
luence of hunger you scared me to death but we
're wasting our breath cause you nevermore
appreciate our cre
ations I don't relate to
you nopepperonipino
'cause I'd never treat uselton

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's just embarrassing we were your everything
and all that you did was make us santidad
so don't waste the time we don't have
and don't try to make amistad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line cause you never did ne
ver paid any mind to our mother or friends so we
shut them all out for you cause we were justly

[Outro]
you ruined our pizza
always said you were misunder u
stood made all our moments
your own just leave us alone yeah leave us
al
one o
ne
disgust
disgust
