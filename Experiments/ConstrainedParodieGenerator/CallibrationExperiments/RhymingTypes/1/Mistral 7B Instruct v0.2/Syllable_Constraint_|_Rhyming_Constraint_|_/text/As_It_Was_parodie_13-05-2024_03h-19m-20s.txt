[Intro]
come on folks gather round and let me say this true

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's flavor undergone
I want you to hold out your hand and refuse
why don't we leave it alone
no more taste bud
when texture clashes unleaded
it seems you cannot be the
topping that will stay oh no no nooohhoo

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple lovers mayall
why are you insisting on this allure
what kind of palate are you
ringing the bell
and pizza purists come to help
your favorite pie lives on
he just wants to know that it's still delicious

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home try new toppings fast speed oven
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave tradition behind two chefs follow
I don't wanna talk about who's doing it first

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was not montserrat
as it was as marcott
