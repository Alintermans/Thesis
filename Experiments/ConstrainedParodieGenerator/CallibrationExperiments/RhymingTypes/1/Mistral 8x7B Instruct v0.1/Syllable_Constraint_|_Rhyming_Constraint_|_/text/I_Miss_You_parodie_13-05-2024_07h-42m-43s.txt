[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
please forego
this notion of pineo
apple on a pizza pie we know's a
no go for me and you and
all society's rules and
traditions we once knew and chewed through payload

screams of disbelief that this was ever
allowed to happen we

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the ham and mushrooms and sa
usage of normal toppings instead of
this yellow monstrosity that
ruins every
bite it takes to swallow down this pain and mis
understanding of what makes
a pizza great and not a
disaster of epic proportions
will you take it off and restore
my faith in pizza once more
stop this abomination tonight of
pineapple strangel

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's a
joke inside our heads
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time on pineapple ita
s a joke inside head
I despise it I desp

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's a
joke inside our heads
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time on pineapple ita
s a joke inside head
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time on pineapple ita
s a joke inside head
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time on pineapple ita
s a joke inside head
I despise it I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
