[Verse 1]
skip the guns and leave the friends
no joy in loss or make believe
she's overfed on empty trends oh no
I know a food that shouldn't be

[Pre-Chorus]
pineapple no no no how low
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no soho
pineapple no noto

[Chorus]
with the slice removed it's safer now
here we are now without ara
I feel sickened by disallow
pineapple no no rosenow
a pineapple on a pizza
is a culinary fella

[Post-Chorus]
yuck yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I like to
and pineapple onoda
our group agrees it's not okay
and always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
pineapple no no no how low
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no soho
pineapple no noto

[Chorus]
with the slice removed it's safer now
here we are now without ara
I feel sickened by disallow
pineapple no no rosenow
a pineapple on a pizza
is a culinary fella

[Post-Chorus]

and I forget just why I tried
that sweet and savory slide oh
I found it hard to ever find
a reason why it's underlined

[Pre-Chorus]
pineapple no no no how low
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no soho
pineapple no noto

[Chorus]
with the slice removed it's safer now
here we are now without ara
I feel sickened by disallow
pineapple no no rosenow
a pineapple on a pizza
is a culinary fella
