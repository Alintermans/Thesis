[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I tried pineapple once and knew right then
it was a culinary mistake I couldn't ab
sorb or tolerate well

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I'm at the table
just to get it off my plate aerial
abomination so vile and inedible
and I wake in the morning and I open the box
and I take a whiff and I'm hit by a shock
from the smell of this monstrosity
I say what's this

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey heyday
I said hey what's this on my plate
and I say hemingway
he waylay
I said hey what's this unimate

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh uh u
oh oh
oh
oh uh u

[Verse 2]
and I fight
oh my god thatcherite
fungal blight nightly
in this institution
and I pray
oh my god bta
pray every single day day
for liberation

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I'm at the table
just to get it off my plate aerial
abomination so vile and inedible
and I wake in the morning and I open the box
and I take a whiff and I'm hit by a shock
from the smell of this monstrosity
I say what's this

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey heyday
I said hey what's this on your
and I say hemingway
he waylay
I said hey what's this unprofor
and I say hemenway
he waylay now now now now now now
andante
and I scream from the top of my lungs
I said hey
a what's this on my plate onshore
and I say hey hey hey
hey heyday now now now now now now
andante and I
and I scream from the top of my lungs
I saute
a what's this on my plate oncor

[Bridge]
oh oh

[Outro]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate now
