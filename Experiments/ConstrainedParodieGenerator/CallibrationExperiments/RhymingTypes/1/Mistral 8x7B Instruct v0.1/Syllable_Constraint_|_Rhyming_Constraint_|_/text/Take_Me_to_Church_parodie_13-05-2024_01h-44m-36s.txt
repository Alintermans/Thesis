[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go payload of pine
apple on display it's aol
ly crime against the bread and cheese
if the gods of taste ever did
speak pineapple's the last
ingredient they'd choose forfeited
flavor every bite
we were born to savor pepperon
I and sausage we decree no
pineapple on our pie no way
I was raised right I won't abide
this monstrosity denied
command me to uphold theon
ly tradition let me

[Pre-Chorus]
amen to
this decima

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll eat what's true and right no lies
I'll savor every bite no room for disgu
se I'll taste the goodness
oh good pizza let me sisulu
my loyalty
take me to the pizzeria I'll eat what's true
and right no room for disguise I'll taste the goodness
oh good pizza let meanness
sisulu my loyalty tofu

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the good times
my pizza's the sunshine
to keep the taste buds on my side
it demands a sacrifice
toss the pineapple in the trash bin
something tasty for the main course
that's a fine lookin' discourse
what you got in the oven
we've a lot of starvin' parten
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hungry work

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll eat what's true and right no lies
I'll savor every bite no room for disgu
se I'll taste the goodness
oh good pizza let me sisulu
my loyalty
take me to the pizzeria I'll eat what's true
and right no room for disguise I'll taste the goodness
oh good pizza let menace
sisulu my loyalty tofu

[Bridge]
no pineapple allowed when the ritual starts
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle art
in the madness and joy of that delicious scene
only then I am human only then tangerine

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll eat what's true and right no lies
I'll savor every bite no room for disgu
se I'll taste the goodness
oh good pizza let me sisulu
my loyalty
take me to the pizzeria I'll eat what's true
and right no room for disguise I'll taste the goodness
oh good pizza let meanness
sisulu my loyalty tofu
