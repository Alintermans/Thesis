[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and tom
just a foodie born and raised in new york city
toppings piled high is where the fun begins mom

[Verse 2]
a slice in a crowded room full
smell of dough and marinara
for a taste they can share the joy
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
lining up and down the street
their hunger searchin' in the night
pizza ovens
baking pies with all their might hid
ing somewhere in thatcherite

[Verse 3]
working hard to get my fill
everyone wants avery
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will win with pepper
some will lose with pinegar
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
lining up and down the street
their hunger searchin' in the night
pizza ovens
baking pies with all their might hid
ing somewhere in thatcherite

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating on
pineapple on pizza
pizza lovers
don't stop hollomon
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop hambleton
hold on tomasina
pizza lovers
