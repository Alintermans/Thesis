[Intro]
pineapple on pizza pie oh say is

[Verse 1]
once the box was opened wide
cheese and sauce mixed with pine inside
I took a bite unified
it tasted wrong and

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later I see
a pizza without pineapple and I'm feeling free again
you dream of savory flavors but pineapple israel
you search for taste explosions but pineapple's not the deal baby

[Chorus]
was it wrong when I spit it out on the floor
was it wrong when I said never anymore
I'll stick to pepperoni and
pineapple's a bore baby was it
over then and is it over now no more

[Post-Chorus]
no pineapple on this

[Verse 2]
when you added pineapple
it tasted likeable
but now it's just unstable
on my pizza table

[Bridge]
and did you think I'd like it really
it's just not the same
only rumors of sweetness and
my taste buds complain oh lord
I think about ordering again
but without allain
just to see you come runnin' and
say the one thing I've been want
ing but no way jose no
more pineapple on my plate no way no how

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizzas later oh no way
if it's got pineapple I'll just say no thanks today oh no yamane
you dream of sweet and savory but pineapple's not okabe
you search for flavor explosions but pineapple's not the way to

[Chorus]
was it wrong when I spit it out on the floor
was it wrong when I said never anymore
I'll stick to pepperoni and
pineapple's a bore baby was it
over then and is it over now no more

[Post-Chorus]
