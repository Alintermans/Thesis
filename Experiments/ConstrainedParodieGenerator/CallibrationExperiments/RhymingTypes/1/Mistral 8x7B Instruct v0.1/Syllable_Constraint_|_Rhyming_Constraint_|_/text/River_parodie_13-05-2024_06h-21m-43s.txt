[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my words now are falling like aco
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with pineapple on his plate
to catch flack sweat jackets and dress
slacks mismatched on his breath's a mistake
he's a mistake and she just wants to dislocate
his trust and leave him in the waste basket ices
are melting on his pizza and he can
taste it he's a disgrace and she just wants to erase it
she's devised a plan to scrape it off his plate and replace it ices
with olives and tomatoes
and he's oblivious to the fact that pineapple's a
no no and she's just trying to save herniate
his taste buds from the disgrace of pineapple on pizza
so she's been on the web lately
says maybe she'll start a petition to get pineap
ple off the menu and he doesn't care he's already had a
slice and he's not going back so dimetapp
the taste of pineapple on his pizza

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my words now are falling like aco
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand it
was come sunrise scram now we hug tight and he's got
pineapple on his pizza and she's got a
problem with it but she eats it anyway
it's hard to find the words to say I don't like it
but she eats it anyway and now she cannaday
regret it but it's too late she's already ate it and
he's already paid for it so she's stuck with it and now she canaday
regret it but it's too late she's already ate it and now she can
tell him that she hates it so she swoveland
regrets it but it's too late she's already ate it
and now she can't take it back so she just sits andante
waits for it to digest and hopes hemenway
doesn't order it again nowaday
she's stuck with the taste of pineapple
on her pizza and she can't shake it off so
she just pushes it away and hopes he
won't order it next
time they go out for pizza and hemingway
doesn't even notice her distaste for it he's just happy
to

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if life was asea
food court and pineapple was a menu item I'd be
swerving In five lanes at a high rate of speed like I
was sliding on Ice maybe that's why I
may have added pineapple
to my pizza I can't justify
my actions but I did it anyway and now
I'm stuck with the taste of pineapple on a
pizza and I can't getaway
from the disgrace of pineapple on pizza
so I just push it away and hope she won

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one
I donkey
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
s gonna do is offend the
taste buds of my friends and family solemnly
the truth andalusian
