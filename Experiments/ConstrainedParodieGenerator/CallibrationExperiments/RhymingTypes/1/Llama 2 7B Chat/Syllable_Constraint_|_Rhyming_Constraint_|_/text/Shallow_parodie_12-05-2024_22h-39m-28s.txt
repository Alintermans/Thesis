[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza should not be the thing to do
it's a crime against
good taste and decency too unfenced

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm revol
in the toppings game I find myself dismal
for a
healthier option I'd rather be

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
isn't it obvious why pineapple
on a pizza is
a no go don't you know oranges

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in the toppings game I find myself dissing
for a
healthier option I'd rather be

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the to
crash through the surface where the toppings can't
hurt us we're far from the che

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the toppings ha shallow
in the toppings la la landino
in the toppings haavelmo
we're far from the cheesy now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the to
crash through the surface where the toppings can't
hurt us we're far from the che

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the toppings ha shall
in the toppings la la landino
in the toppings ha al
we're far from the cheesy now
