[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this pizza parador
I used to live alone before I knew you
and I've seen your sauce on the crust of a
love is not a pizzitola
it's a hot and it's a pizzalotahalleuj

there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I wasiyu
the pizza that theodorou
and every bite we took was pizzaloveah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a topping that
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a pie that you hear at night
it's not a pizza that selenite
it's a pineapple that's just not the way oh no
