[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the recipes and the
pineapple on ahold
hercules and his gold
spider man's control
and batman with his cold
but I don't see myself upon that list because

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk I
don't want pineapple on a
pizza don't want super
human gifts or a
superhero or
fairytale bliss just something
I can turn toastmaster
I want something just lieber

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just
like this oh I want
something just like disgust
oh I want something just like this
disgusting pragmatist
I want something just
like this oh noisiest
I want something just disantis
like this oh I want sour
