[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the fruit that ruins allaire
the topping in the pie that's sorely mis
the unsuspecting palate
of flavor in the dish that
we can't enjoy like jack andersonville
where you're not presentations
and we'll have summer onomastics
and in the night we'll wish this banamex
we'll wish this ban ante

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atoll

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where art thou and I'm so sorry
I cannot dine without this pineapple
I need somebody andraki
this sickening sweet
comes creeping on with such a palladium
and as I dillydally
the juice from all the pineap
dripping down and making meleis
like indecision to exclude
and hear your voice ofc
will you come table and stop this painless
stop this pineapples

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't partake in me you're already the
voice inside my head pine
don't partake in me
you're already the voice inside myreon
don't partake incite
don't partake iny

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't partake in me you're already the
voice inside my head pine
don't partake in me
you're already the voice inside myreon
don't partake incite
don't partake iny
don't partake in me you're already the
voice inside my headline
don't partake inky
don't partake in me you're already the
voice inside my headlines
don't partake indy

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atoll
I pine for peace aton
I pine for peace aplomb
