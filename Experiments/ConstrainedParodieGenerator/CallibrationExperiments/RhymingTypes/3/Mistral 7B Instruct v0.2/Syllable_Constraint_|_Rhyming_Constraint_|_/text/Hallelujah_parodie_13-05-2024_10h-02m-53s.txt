[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret fruit
that didn't belong on aouzou
but you don't really care for taste I betta
it goes like this pineapple fifth
the sweet surprise theorizing
the baffled palate pondering pineapple

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 2]
your pizza was fine but you needed
a twist to make itinerant
her pineapple topping overthrew ya'll'
they put you in a savory
they sliced your cheese and they marrone
and from your plate they drew the hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 3]
you say I took the rule in vain
I don't even getaways
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a burst of flavor in every
topping it doesn't matterease
the classic or the exotic halleluj

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I hadrian
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the spatafore
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Outro]
hallelujah pineapple free

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this dish I've savion
I used to live alone before I knew you
and I've seen your flag on the pepperon
love is not a victory dance
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved inuit
the holy pepper wasiyu
and every bite we drew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned froman
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who justifies
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
