[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
feeling out oftedahl

[Verse 1]
give me a slice or two to ponder something funky
to write a letter toomey
to tell me what to dokey
do you read my surveys and
polls on pineapple andean
when you said it was arousal
was I even on your plate
I knew when I asked you to add itinerant
you'd do the opposite ofelia
and I'd end up more averse to it elia's curse so if pineapple
really wants to know melee
pineapple when itami
wish it wasn't a crime to be free from pineapple
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now we're happier
happier than ever with our pizza tower
wish we could explain it better to pineapple hour after
wish it wasn't true key of

[Verse 2]
you call me again with a pineap
ple plea in your pineacar gleaming
you scared me to death with your pineap stallkamp
but I'm wasting my breath on ariane
I don't pineap relate
I don't pineap relate to
'cause I'd never treat me this pineap
pineap made me disneyland

[Verse 3]
and I don't pineap talk shit about pineapple on
the internet never told anyone
anything pineap bad that's pineapisingly
embarrassing you were my everything and
all that pineapple did was pineapples
pineapple always said pineapple
was misunderstood pineapple made all my moments pineap
own just pineap leave me alone pineap foolery
pineap ruined everything good pineapple neverland
pineap always said pineapple wassily

[Outro]
you pineap ruined pineap
everything pineap good weatherman
pineap always said pineap
was misunderstood pineap made all pine
ap
pineap
just
pineap
leave me
