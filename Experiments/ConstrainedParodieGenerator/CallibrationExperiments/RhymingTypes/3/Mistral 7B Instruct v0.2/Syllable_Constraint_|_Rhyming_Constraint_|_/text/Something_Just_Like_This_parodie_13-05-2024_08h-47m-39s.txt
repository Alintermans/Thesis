[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple andreano
pepper and its ragu
jenga andreano
cheese and its mashalu
but I'm not the kind of person who'll allow minute

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for somebody
with a pineapple ony
some oddity show
some strange deluded
just something I cancelling
somebody iosif
I want something justices

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something justices
doo doo doo doo do do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something justices
I want something justices
