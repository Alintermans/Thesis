[Verse 1]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
it's a mystery of the
food chain's decline androgynous
welcome to the final bite I hope itasca
you've got tomatoes on your
best plate but that pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right we've been here
before why are we always stuck with this
topping that rupturing
we never order right wearily
why are we always stuck with this topping
that's rupturing our

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away frommelt
just stop your whining it'll beeferman
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away frommelt

[Verse 2]
just stop your whining let the flavors fly high
soaring through the savory
skies remember everything
will be right we can try again sometime
we can meet again somewhere
somewhere far from theorist

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right we've been here
before why are we always stuck with this
topping that rupturing
we never order right wearily
why are we always stuck with this topping
that's rupturing our

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away frommelt
stop your whining baby it'll beeferman
they told me that the end is near

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right we've been here
before why are we always stuck with this
topping that rupturing
we never order right wearily
why are we always stuck with this topping
that's rupturing our

[Bridge]
we don't compromise
we should redefine
our taste palatine
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
stop your whining baby it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away
we got to get away we got to getaway
we got to get away we got to getaways
we got to get away ita
we got to get away waylay
we got to get away wayla
