[Intro]
come on folks gather round and let me say this true

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's flavor wonnacott
I want you to hold out the palm oftedahl
why don't we leave itamar
nothin' to taste
when texture clashes andante
it's a topping that defaced
and I'm the one who'll abstain ohohoh

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same asmara
in this world ofallon
you know it's not the same asmussen
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple fans allenbaugh
why are you insisting on this raw fruit
what kind of taste isuzu
ringin' the bell
and we're all shaking ourself
your pepperoni andress
he just wants to know that your choice isidore

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same asmara
in this world ofallon
you know it's not the same asmussen
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home try new toppings fasta speeda
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave the pineapple behind and follow
I don't wanna talk about who's ordering it

[Outro]
as
it was not
you know it's not the same asimov
as it was asimov
