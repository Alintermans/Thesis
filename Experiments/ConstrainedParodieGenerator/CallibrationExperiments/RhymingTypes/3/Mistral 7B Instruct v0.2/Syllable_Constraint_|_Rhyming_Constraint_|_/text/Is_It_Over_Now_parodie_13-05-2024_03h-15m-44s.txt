[Intro]
is it right to dine with pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once the pie had baked and cool
pineapple on theodorou
pepperoni disappro
your palate's new

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizzas later we see
your slice with pineapple's eyes and its tropical decency
you crave for pepper's zest before it called you aphrodite
you search in every gourmet's plate for something finer baby

[Chorus]
was it wrong when pineapple touched your cheese and
was it wrong when tomato sauce wasserman
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed outbidding
was it wrong then and is it wrong righteousness

[Post-Chorus]
is it right is it right

[Verse 2]
when you lost your taste control
melted cheese andrepont
red sauce and pineapple float
your new dish is a clone

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
there were critics with
at least I had the decency
to keep my palliative
only rumors about myopic
and myotrophin
oh lord I think about adding
exotic toppings just to
see you come running backlund
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred arguments later oh no
if it's got pineapple eyes I will surmise that you'll probably disown
you crave for pepper's zest before it called you aphrodite oh
you search in every chef's kitchen for something finer baby

[Chorus]
was it wrong when pineapple touched your cheese and
was it wrong when tomato sauce wasserman
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed outbidding
was it wrong then and is it wrong righteousness

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it right is it right
is it
is israel

[Bridge]
thought I didn't notice
there were critics with
at least I had the decency
to keep my nights outshining
only rumors about myopic
and myotrophin
oh lord I think about adding
exotic toppings just to
see you come running backfiring
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Outro]
critics shining oh lord
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees latimore
critics shining I was hoping you'd be
and say the one thing oh lord
I've been wanting oblong
but no
is it right is it right is it right is it right
