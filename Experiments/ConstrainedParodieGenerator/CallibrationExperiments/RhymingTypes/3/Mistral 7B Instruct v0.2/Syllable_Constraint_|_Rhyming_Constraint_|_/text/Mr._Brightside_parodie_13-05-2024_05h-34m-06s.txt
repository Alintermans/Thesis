[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta keep it cool because I hate the pineap
it started out on a pie but now it's on a pizza
now I'm cringin' inside and my taste buddhism
now I'm reachin' for water and she's orderin
while he's savourin' his slice and she iselin
now they're sharin' a laugh and my palatable
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's savourin' his bite
he's chewin' with delight
let me be
'cause I just can't watch it defile my dec
and takanashi

[Chorus]
pineapplesity turning food into
swimmin' through savory lies
chokin' on your justifies
but it's just the price I pay
destiny isentropic
open up my disinclined
'cause I'm mr hindsight

[Guitar Solo]
