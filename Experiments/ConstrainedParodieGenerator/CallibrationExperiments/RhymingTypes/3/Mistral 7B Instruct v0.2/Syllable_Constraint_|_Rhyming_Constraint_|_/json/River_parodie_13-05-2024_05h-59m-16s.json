He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover oftentimes\nall my mistakes need correction time and again redefined\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is a\npineapple on a pizza debate andrada\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's bringing pine to the table for a taste\nbut it clashes with every\ntopping on the plate misplaced and mis\nmatched on his breath's a six pack and arianespace\nand she just wants to exact revenge andante\nshe's kept track of all his internet sear\nches and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the\nnext with a new recipe in hand and I know she's using melee\nto play him I donaway\n'cause she loves novelty and a mad scientist aaa\nand you don't mess with no chef's creation e\neven I know that but she's devised some plan alexei\nto sabotage the pizza scene\nknife in hand says our culinary uniondale\nis hanging by a strand so she's been on the web lately aubrey\nsays maybe she'll be my margherita to\nspite her man and I know she's using me\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover oftentimes\nall my mistakes need correction time and again redefined\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is a\npineapple on a pizza debate andrada\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one bite stand turned a two bite stand it\nwas come midnight scram now we hug tight and then some\nhe found out now she feels betrayed and used up\n'cause he left so what he did it first toshiba\nnow how am I supposed to tell this girl that wehrmann\nit's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous andel\ndon't want this to hurt but what you deserve israel\nso I revert to the studio like hole in the wall dinicola\ndon't have to be reserved in a booth but I feel like the person\nwho I'm turning into's irreverent\nI preyed on you like it's a pizza pie and now that\nI got you I don't want you pineapple onondaga\ntook advantage in my thirst tokuyama\nwhy do I do this dirt thatcherism\nget on my soapbox andolina\ndetergent and bleach is burning the wound because\nnow with her in the oven weehawken\nwe can't bring herta\nworld should've known to use protectionism\nbefore I bit into your forbidden fruit pineapple a\nno\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's pine my name's pine\nriver\npip\ninelude\nriver run applewhite\ncall me pine call me pine appleman\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the bridesmaid never the bride hey\nfuck can I say if pizza israel\nand deceit is an enclave I'm swerving inoculate\nI can't keep my lies straight but I made you termi\nnate this love triangle left usa\nwreck tangled what canaday\nI don't want to admit italy\nbet I really would've loved your smile but I didn\n't really wanna abort but what's one more lie\nto tell our unborn child awhile\npineapple on a pizza debate andrak\nit was fun for a while but now theorize\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover oftentimes\nall my mistakes need correction time and again redefined\nwell little one\nI meanwhile\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif allmon\n\nit's gonna cause is a pineap\nle on a pizza debate andrada truax\n",
