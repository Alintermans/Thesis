[Intro]
I think I've found a way to express
my hate for pineapple on a
pizza crust that's oh so fine and fair
it's just not right to put it
there inkjet

[Verse]
I've dug a hole for pineapple
can't pretend that it's a topping that's cool ithaca
oh man what a flavor the things I
hear people say that it's a crime against taste
some like it sweet some like it hot
but pineapple on pizza is just not what ireton
and you'd have thought that I would let it go
and let you eat it with a grin but no way jayashankar
I'll fight against itinerant
pineapple pizza with all my might until theism
is gone and we can all unsubscribe
from this madness that they call arianespace
I've dug a hole for palafox
can't pretend that it's a topping that's cool itamar
oh man what a flavor the things ipsco
hear people say that it's a crime against taste buds calderon

[Chorus]

in my grave pine neoax

[Outro]
