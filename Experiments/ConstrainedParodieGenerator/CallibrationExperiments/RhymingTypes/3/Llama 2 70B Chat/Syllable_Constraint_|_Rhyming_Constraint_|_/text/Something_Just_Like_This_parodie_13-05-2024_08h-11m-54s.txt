I've been eating pizza for
a long time now it's true

and chicken too anew
but one toastmaster
I just can't abuse

how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
tastes like a tropicalisk
some superhero
some fair foodservice
just something I canvassing
somebody toweling
I want something justices

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
pepperoni or
sausage or masonite
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like
pepperoni or
sausage or mcintyre
oh I want something justices
I want something justices
