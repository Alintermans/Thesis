[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me somethin
is pineapple on your pneumatic
do you need more to
satisfy your cravings despising

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm callin
in all the good slices I find myelin
longin
and in the bad times I'm filled with fright

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me somethin
boy arent you tired of pragmatic
or do you need more
aint it hard keepin it so plasterboard

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
im callin
in all the good slices I find myelin
longin
and in the bad times I'm filled with fright

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
im off the deep end watch as I dive in
ill never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they cant hurt us we
re far from the bumbalough

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow in
the sha ha la la la laxative
in the sha ha shallow we
re far from the bumbalough

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
im off the deep end watch as I dive in
ill never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they cant hurt us we
re far from the bumbalough

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow
in the sha ha la la lazaro
in the sha haavelmo
we re far from the bumbal
