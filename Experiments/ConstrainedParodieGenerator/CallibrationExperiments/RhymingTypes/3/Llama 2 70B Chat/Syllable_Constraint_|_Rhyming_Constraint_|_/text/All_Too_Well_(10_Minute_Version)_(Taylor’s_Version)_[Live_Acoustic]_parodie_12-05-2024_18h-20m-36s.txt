[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somewh
how could they put pineapple on aforesa

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory cravings we
re singing in the car getting apathy
autumn leaves falling down like anchovies onni
and I can picture it after allergies

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that flavor's not here no more
and I might be okay but my taste israel
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost spilled the sauce cause you were looking overexcites
pepperoni in my hair
I was there I remember it

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza on the counter your cheeks were turn
ing red you used to be a little kid with a big appetizers
and your mother's telling stories bout you and your brotheihood
you told me bout your cravings thinking your future was
a slice of hawaiian and you were tossing me the menu
flip flopping on the ground we were always skipping
town and I was thinking on the drive down heiresses
hes gonna say its love you never called it what it was
til we were dead and gone inured
check the pulse and come back swearing its the same
after three sophisticate
and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
but all I felt was shame and you held my lamere

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know its long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigeration
light down the stairs I was
there I remember ithaca
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you liposome
sacred prayer andean
we'd swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked forsaken
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tawana
running scared I was there
I remember it alpirez
and you call me up again just to break me like aroma
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
cause I remember it all too

[Verse 4]
they say alls well that ends well but im in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would hematite
and that made me watertight
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you not
weeping in a party bathroom som
actress asking me what happened you ha
that's what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self effacing jo
sipping coffee like you're on a late night showbo
but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come
and he said its supposed to be fun turning twenty won

[Verse 5]
time won't fly its like im paralyzed by it
id like to be my old self again but im still trying toweling
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk homophone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
cause it reminds you of innocence andrzejewski
you can't get ridership
cause you remember it all too well

[Chorus]
cause there we are again when I loved you
so back before you lost the one real thing you verbo
it was rare I was there
I remember it alpirez
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it wall
it was rare ijames
I was there I remember it

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
ill get older but your lovers stay my age
from when your brooklyn broke my skin ando
bones im a soldier who's returning halfway
home and did the twin flame bruise paint you
blue just between us did the love affair mahmood
cause in this city barrone
I still remember the first fall of snow
and how it glistened as it fell
I remember it alpirez

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it alpirez wind inverness
I was there I was there down the stairwell
it was rare you remember itel
I was there I was there down the stra
it was rare you remember it alpirez
wind in my hair I was there ijames
down the stairs I was there hazelett
it was rare you remember itek
I was there I was there down the
stairs I was there it was rare you rebel
I was there I was there italtel
I was there I was there hazelett
it was rare you remember I
I was there I was there down the stairwell
