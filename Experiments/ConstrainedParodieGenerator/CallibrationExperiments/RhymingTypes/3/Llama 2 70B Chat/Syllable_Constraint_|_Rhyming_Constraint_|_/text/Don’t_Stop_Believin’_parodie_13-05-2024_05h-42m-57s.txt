in a kitchen where the flavors are making
a culinary delight that's oh so divine

[Pre-Chorus]
margherita
or maybe pepperoni
but pineapple no way that's just

that's perfect indemnify
but pineapple ruins the surprise
it justifies

[Pre-Chorus]
margherita
or maybe pepperoni
but pineapple no way that's just

to find a slice ofallon
