[Intro]
is it wrong to put pineapple on a

[Verse 1]
pizza that's the question that
we all must face today people
say it's fine itinerant
but to me it's just

[Pre-Chorus]
ain't no way to justify the sin of putting fruit
on a beautiful pie that's meant to be savory andrew
you might as well go all out and put ketchup on aouzou
or put peanut butter on a pizza crust that's just not what it

[Chorus]
was it over when the hawaiians put it
on their pizza or was it justifying
the thought of putting fruit on a
pizza that's just not right washington
it over then or is it overrated

[Post-Chorus]

on your pizza oh so proudly
there were flashing lightheaded
people talking bout theophila

oh lord I think about leaving
this place empty handed just

to keep my night shorenstein
only rumors bout my hampshirites
and my whispered signs

off of very tall someth
ings just to see you come rumbling
