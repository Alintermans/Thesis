[Verse 2]
your taste buds may be strong and bold but

ist but I don't even know

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been to hawai
I know this pizza israel
I used to live alone before I knew you
and I've seen your flag on the marble arch
love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved into
the pizza shop with you goodhue
and every slice we drew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned froman
is how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
