[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain ickes
it makes mehrabian

[Verse 1]
give me a slice of pepperoni nd a coke to
think of somethin' clever to
write a song about pinepp
and how it doesn't belong
do you read the menu orlo
or do you just ignore hebron
when you said you were hungry
was I even on your mindroni rorabaugh
I knew when I asked you to rossignol
be cool about what I was tellin' you rossignol cuneiform
you'd do the opposite of
what you said you'd doberman
and I'd end up more afraid rorabaugh rorabaugh
don't say it isn't fair you

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain ickes it makes mehrab
when I'm away from pineapple I'm happier than everest
wish I could explain it bet

[Verse 2]
you call me again drunk in your ben
drivin' home under the influence
you scared me to death but I'm wast inverness
cause you only listen to ourself
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
cause I'd never treat me this ship
you made me hate this pepcid

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anythin' bad
cause that shit's embarrassin' you were my evry
and all that you did was make me ferdinand
so don't waste the time I donavan
and don't try to make meenaghan
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line cause you never dimly
never paid any mind to my mother or fahrenheit
so I shut em all out for you cause ikey

[Outro]
you ruined everythin
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone yeah fuck you
ah
goddam
ah
f you
