[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I protest against the

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
the topping thatcherism
the scourge of pizza lovers everywhere
a fruit that doesn't belong
on a pie that's meant to be
savored not suffered through with disorient
we can't enjoyably
eat pizza with pineapple onboard
and in the night we'll wish this neverland
a flavor asylum

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza without
pineapple nissenbaum

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor and logic
a topping that's so divisive and ap
polarizing figure infring
on the rights of pe
ople who just want to enjoy ariane
zing pizza without ari
nge flavors that don't go
together like oil and water do
not mix and do not belong in
the same place atrocity
a culinary abomination
that must beauchemin

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple pizza
you're already the voice
of reason in my head
I miss pizza without pineapple nissen
I miss pizza without
pineapple nondirect

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple pizza
you're already the voice
of reason in my head
I miss pizza without pineapple nissen
I miss pizza without
pineapple nondirect
I miss pizza without pineapple nisbet
I miss pizza without
pineapple nonetheless
I miss pizza without pineapple nivens
I miss pizza without
pineapple nov

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza without
pineapple nissenbaum
I miss pizza without
pineapple nissenbaum
