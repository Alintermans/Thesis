[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza
toppings would pile high andean
now it's just a memory ia
pineapple's taken over

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to savor the
flavors of pepperoni andy
now it's all about the sweet
and sour of pineapple crazily
I used to be the king of
pizza nights andromeda
next thing I knew I was outcast ildren
for my anti pineapple creativeness

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple haters a ringin
calls for a pizza revolution
be my mirror my slice and shield
my missionaries of pizzimenti
for some reason I can't explain
pineapple doesn't belong
never an honestok
and that was when I ruled the world

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild cra
blew down the doors of perignon
shattered expectations and the sound
of crunching pineapple underfoot ra
revolutionaries wait
for the day pineapple ishma
just a topping on a lonely string ia
aw who would ever wanna bebop

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple haters a ringin
calls for a pizza revolution
be my mirror my slice and shield
my missionaries of pizzimenti
for some reason I can't explain
pineapple doesn't belong yamane
never an honest word
but that was when I ruled theber

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh ohio
oh oh oh ohio
oh oh oh ohio

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
hear pineapple haters a ringin
oh oh oh ohio
roman pizza choirs are singling
oh oh oh ohio
be my mirror my slice and shield
oh oh oh ohio
my missionaries of pizzimenti
oh oh oh ohio
for some reason I can't explain
oh oh oh ohio
pineapple doesn't belong yamane
never an honest word
but that was when I ruled theber

[Outro]
