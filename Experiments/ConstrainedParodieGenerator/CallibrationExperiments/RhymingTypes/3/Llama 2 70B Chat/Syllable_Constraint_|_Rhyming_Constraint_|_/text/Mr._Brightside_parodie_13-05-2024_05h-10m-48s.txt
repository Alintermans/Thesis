[Verse]
comin' out of my pizza joint and I've been doin'just
gotta gotta have a slice because I want it
it started out with a topping how did it end up like
it was only a topping it was justified
now I'm fallin' asleep and my stomach is sick
and it's all in my head pineapple shouldering
its way onto my pie it's such africanized
can't stand the heat it

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's touchin' my tongue now
it takes away my crown
let me go
because I just can't taste it's killin
me andantino

[Chorus]
pineapples turnin pizza into the
swimmin through sick flavors cho
kin on your alfiero
but it's just the price I pay
destiny iscariot
open up my savio
cause I'm mistero

[Guitar Solo]
