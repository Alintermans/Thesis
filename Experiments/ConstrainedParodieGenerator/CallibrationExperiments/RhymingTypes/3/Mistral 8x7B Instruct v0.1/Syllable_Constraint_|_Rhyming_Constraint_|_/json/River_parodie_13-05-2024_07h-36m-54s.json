He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hack with mynhier\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing allister\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is make\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's coming home with pineapple on pizza\nto catch flack sweat jacksonian\non his breath's jack he's a disaster\nand I just want to exact my vindication\nit's a farce she's on his back like aventura\nshe's kept track of all his pizza choices\nand guess who just happens to be moving on to the next\nactually just shit on that pineapple abomination and\nits a travesty sheila\nand you don't put pineapple on a pizza even\nI know she's using me to try tomasina\nI don't care hI susan but I shoulda saudia\nafter the first bite but tonight\nI am a liar thief a lover alethea\nall my sins need holy water feel it washing overprotect\nme well little one I don't want toa\ndmit to something if all itinerant\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hack with mynhier\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing allister\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is make\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one bite wonder turned a two bite sin\nit was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and in\nhe found out now she feels deceived and used up\nit's hard to find the words to say itasca\ndon't want this to hurt but what you deserve ishman\nthe truth don't take it personal I justices\ncan't say this in person to you so I retracted\nto the studio like hole in the wall diners don't have tostenson\nbe reserved in a booth I just feel like the person who I'm turning\ninto's irreversible I preston\nplayed on you like it's church at the pew and now thati\ngot you I don't want you took advantage inadvertent\nin my thirst to pursue why do ikea\ndo this dirt that I do got toshiba\nget on my soapbox andalusia\nmy sermon and speech detergent and bleach isburn\ning the wound cause now with herbivorous\nin the womb weiseman\ncan't bring her in this world should havemann\nused protection before I bit into your forsythia\nfu\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's ooh my name's o\nohh oh\noh\nriver run\ncall me ophthalmoscope\ncall me ooh we'll let theophila\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the jester with my words never\nthe bride hey fuck can I say lifesaver\nand deceit was a highway I was swerving onlookers\nspeeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice maybe\nthat's why I may have came at yellower\nmy lies straight but mynhier\nI made you terminate mycology\nthis love triangle left us in a wreck tangled\nwhat else can I say it was fun for a while\nbet I really woulda loved your style\ndidn't really wanna abort but fuck it\nwhat's one more lie to tell our unrefined\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hack with mynhier\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing allister\nwell little one\nI donor\n\nparody meaning explained line by line\nparrotta\n\nI've been a joker with my words\nI've used the idea of pineapple onward\n",
