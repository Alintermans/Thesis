[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
its taste is a cursea bitter
on a slice it does not belong
on a slice it does notochord

[Verse 2]
second things second
ham and cheese is the true combo platter pairing
don't you dare add that
sweet and tangy fruit to my pepper
to my pepperoni feather

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a classic cu
but now I see the abomino
fruit on pizza does not belong
it's just so wrong on every single song oh oh
it's a sin against aouzou
it's a culinary abstru
so don't you dare disabuse
me of my belief in pizza

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer that
pineapple's got no place
pain you break me down witherington
my trust inoculate
pain you made me a believer inertia
that pineapple's got no righteousness
pain you made me a believable
that pizza israel

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a curse to the pineapple gods
all the hate forcier
their fruit on pizza is a fraud oh oh
their fruit on pizza isotopes

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a classic
but now I see theorizing
fruit on pizza does notices
it's just so wrong onomastics
it's a sin against aphrodite's banquet table
it's a culinary abracadabra table rapping
so don't you

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer that
pineapple's got no place
pain you break me down witherington
my trust inoculate
pain you made me a believer inertia
that pineapple's got no righteousness
pain you made me a believable
that pizza israel

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the pizza gods above
you're the face of the future
the blood in my veins oh oh
the blood in my veins oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did desist from adding pineapple
it's a sin against the holy trinity of pizza pie
it's a culin

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer that
pineapple's got no place
pain you break me down witherington
my trust inoculate
pain you made me a believer inertia
that pineapple's got no righteousness
pain you made me a believable
that pizza israel
