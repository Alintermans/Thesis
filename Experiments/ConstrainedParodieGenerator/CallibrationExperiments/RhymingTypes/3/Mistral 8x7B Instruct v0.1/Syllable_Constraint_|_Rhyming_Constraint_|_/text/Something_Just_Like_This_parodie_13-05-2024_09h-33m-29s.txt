[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni andries
and bbq ponto
cheese burst andraki
but something noteboom
pineapple on pizza is a definite taboo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a topping
that's a tropical blitzes
just something taco
something notices
just something I canvasses
something I reminis
I want something justices

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something justices
doo doo doo doo do do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something justices
I want something justices

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
margherita andries
and veggie subaru
but pineapple onscreen
is something I refuse
it's a topping that I will not ingenue

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk I
'm not looking for a topping that
will make me reminis the
taste of disavow
something justifies
just something I conradine
something I devonshire

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something justices
I want something justices

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something justices
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something justices
doo doo doo doo do do
doo doo doo do do
doo doo do oahu

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a topping
that's a tropical blitzes
just something taco
something notices
just something I canvasses
something I canvassing
I want something justices

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something justices
oh I want something justices
oh I want something justices
