[Intro]
I think I've had my fill of that sweet
pineapple on pizza dish we
once shared with glee and laughter now a
ghastly memory I can
never eat

[Verse]
I've tasted two disasters on
my plate and now I see the error of my palomar
oh me oh my the taste is sour
if I could turn back time I'd never let that
fruit invade my pizza hour
some like it sweet some like it savory but aulander
pineapple has no place on pizza pie
and I don't wanna take another bite so tozier
my plate I'll clear and nevermore
will I let that monstrosity adorn my savion
farewell to pineapple forever
oh me oh my the taste is sour ifas
I could turn back time andover
never let that monstrosity adorn my plasterer
farewell to pineapple forever iced
in my grave I'll rot and nevermore will I be haverford

[Chorus]
in my grave I'll rot
in my coldiron
grave I'll rot and diefenbach
in my fragonard
grave I'll rot and overstock
in my grave ikon

[Outro]
in my grave I'll rot
I'll rot I rosenstock
is my pain your pleasure
is all of my pain your treasure
enjoy
