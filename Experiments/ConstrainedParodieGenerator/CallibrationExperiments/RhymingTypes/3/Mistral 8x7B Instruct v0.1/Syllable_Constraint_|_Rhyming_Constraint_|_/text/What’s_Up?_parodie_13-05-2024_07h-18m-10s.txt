[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I tried pineapple once and knew right then
it was a culinary mistake I couldn't ab
sorb or tolerate well

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I'm at the table
just to get it off my plate andean
I'm feeling a little peculiar now and then
and so I wake in the morning and I open up
the fridge and I take a slice andromeda
margherita's what I crave instead
and I say to

[Chorus]
myself hey hey hey hey
getaway
from this pineapple pizza trend
and I say hey heyday
getaways
from this monstrosity myette

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
and I stri

avoid this fungal inf
estation
and I pray ohmura
do I pray daily forsaken
these pineapple slic

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I'm at the table
just to get it off my plate andean
I'm feeling a little peculiar now and then
and so I wake in the morning and I open up
the fridge and I take a slice andromeda
margherita's what I crave instead
and I say to

[Chorus]
myself hey hey hey hey

from this pineapple pizza
trend and I say heyday
