[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and tom
just a foodie born and raised in new york city
pizza lover on a quest for aforeth

[Verse 2]
a slice in a crowded pizzer
topped with pineapple andover
for a taste they can't deny
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
lining up and down the street
their hunger searchin' in the night
pizza ovens
baking pies for alliedsignal
serving up emotion in

[Verse 3]
working hard to get my fill
everybody crusading
paying anything to get their fill
just onex's

[Verse 4]
some will win some will lose
some are born toshimitsu
oh the movie never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
lining up and down the street
their hunger searchin' in the night
pizza ovens
baking pies for alliedsignal
serving up emotion in

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating it
hold on to that feeling
pizza owings
don't stop hankering
hold on
pizza owings
don't stop hankering
hold on to that feeling
pizza owing
