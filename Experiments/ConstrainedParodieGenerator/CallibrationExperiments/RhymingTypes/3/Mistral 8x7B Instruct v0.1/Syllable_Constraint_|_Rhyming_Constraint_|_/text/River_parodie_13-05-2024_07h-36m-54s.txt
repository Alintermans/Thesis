[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hack with mynhier
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing allister
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is make
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's coming home with pineapple on pizza
to catch flack sweat jacksonian
on his breath's jack he's a disaster
and I just want to exact my vindication
it's a farce she's on his back like aventura
she's kept track of all his pizza choices
and guess who just happens to be moving on to the next
actually just shit on that pineapple abomination and
its a travesty sheila
and you don't put pineapple on a pizza even
I know she's using me to try tomasina

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one bite wonder turned a two bite sin
it was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and in
he found out now she feels deceived and used up
it's hard to find the words to say itasca
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve ishman
the truth don't take it personal I justices
can't say this in person to you so I retracted
to the studio like hole in the wall diners don't have tostenson
be reserved in a booth I just feel like the person who I'm turning
into's irreversible I preston
played on you like it's church at the pew and now thati
got you I don't want you took advantage inadvertent
in my thirst to pursue why do ikea
do this dirt that I do got toshiba
get on my soapbox andalusia

can't bring her in this world should havemann
used protection before I bit into your forsythia

the bride hey fuck can I say lifesaver
and deceit was a highway I was swerving onlookers
speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice maybe
that's why I may have came at yellower
my lies straight but mynhier
I made you terminate mycology
this love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your style
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unrefined

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hack with mynhier
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing allister

I've used the idea of pineapple onward
as a joke andreas
