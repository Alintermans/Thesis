[Intro]
pineapple on pizza pie oh say is

[Verse 1]
once the box was opened wide
cheese and sauce mixed with pine inside
I took a bite andesite
it tasted wrong so

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later I see
a pizza without pineapple on it sets mexicali
you dream of savory flavors before you took achilles
you search for pizza without it in italy maybe better

[Chorus]

was it wrong when I added sweet onrushing
pineapple to your savory

with pineapple on

you search in every pizzeria's menu for something greater

[Chorus]
was it wrong when I laid down on your slice dish
was it wrong when I added sweet onrushing
pineapple to your savory
in your dream as you passed itami
was it wrong then and is it wrong nowaczy
