[Verse]
emerging from my denial and I've been doing
fine without that taste I've been declininguh u
stuck in my ways and I've been refusingthat slice so bland
it started with a bite but now I understand
it's a travesty to put pineapple on a
pizza base it's just a waste of space andrada
relish and tomato now my stomach isa
mess and it's all in taste

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're adding it now and
it's driving mejia
sanity
and it's ruining the purity of
my beloved pantry

[Chorus]
jealousy of those who partake in this
monstrosity swimming through
sickening recipes but
it's just the taste I despise
destiny isotonic
opening my bitterroot
cause I amadou

[Guitar Solo]
