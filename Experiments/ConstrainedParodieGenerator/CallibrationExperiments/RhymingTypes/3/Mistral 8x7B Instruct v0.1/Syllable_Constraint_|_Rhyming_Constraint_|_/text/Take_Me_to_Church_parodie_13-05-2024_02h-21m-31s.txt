[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go payload of pine
apple on display it's aol
ly crime against the bread and cheese
if the gods of taste ever did
speak they'd frown upon this
creation every daydreaming
of pepperoni or
sausage we were raised right but still they
put pineapple on the slice it
sickens me but I can't resist
the sweet and savory clintonite
disguise I wassilievitch
born with good taste but nowadays
I crave the forbidden

[Pre-Chorus]
aahh yes way
way yesterdays

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie it's a sinful trickery
tell me why you'd mar this holy matrimony
offer me a better fe
ast good god let me keep italy
keep pineapples
off my pizza pie it's a sinful trickery
tell me why you'd mar this holy matriarchy
offer me arianespace
good god let me keep itty bitty

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the classic
toppings then myopic
pineapple's got no partying
in the sacred spacewalking
drain the whole sea to find a worthy
topping meaty for the main course
that's a fine looking hawthorne
what you got in the kitchen
we've a lot of starving pizza
lovers that's delizioso please
this is hunger work

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie it's a sinful trickery
tell me why you'd mar this holy matrimony
offer me a better fe
ast good god let me keep italy
keep pineapples
off my pizza pie it's a sinful trickery
tell me why you'd mar this holy matriarchy
offer me arianespace
good god let me keep itty bitty

[Bridge]
no pineapple allowed when the feast begins here
there is no sweeter innocence than our unmarried
cheese and tomato scene only then I am a
pizza lover only then I am alegria

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie it's a sinful trickery
tell me why you'd mar this holy matrimony
offer me a better fe
ast good god let me keep italy
keep pineapples
off my pizza pie it's a sinful trickery
tell me why you'd mar this holy matriarchy
offer me arianespace
good god let me keep itty bitty
