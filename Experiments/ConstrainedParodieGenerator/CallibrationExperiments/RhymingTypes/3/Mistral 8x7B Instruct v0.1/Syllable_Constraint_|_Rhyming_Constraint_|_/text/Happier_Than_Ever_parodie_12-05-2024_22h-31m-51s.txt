[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue and mad
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just ishida

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think it through now see here
why this fruit oncology
should not be on a pizza
do you taste the acid tang
or is your palate esteban
when you said you'd give itamar
a chance did you not care at
all that you'd just ruin it all for allensbach
and yet you did it anyway andros
and left me in dismay oh boy how sad I feel today odega
don't say it canavan
you clearly weren't aware
that you made me full of despair so if you really
wanna know why I won't share

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue and
wish I could explain it clearer but it just ishidae
happier than ever without it on my dinner waertsilae
wish it wasn't true but it

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask me why not
it's such a simple thing to add to
but I'll tell you why it doesn't goings
it's just a fruit that doesn't belong on
a savory dish like this
you call me up and ask me how
but I've already told you all
about the acidity

[Verse 3]
and I don't tweet about it on the net no way no
never told a soul it's just not worth the
time or energy it's such a simple thing to
avoid and yet you still insist oncogen
escalating the situation and
making me feel bad forfeitable
I could talk about the times you tried to change my mind but it
would just be a waste of time because you neverland
listened to my reasons why and yet you still persisted
and now I just can't stand theatrical

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone yeah fuck you
ah
goddam
ah
fuck you
fuck you
