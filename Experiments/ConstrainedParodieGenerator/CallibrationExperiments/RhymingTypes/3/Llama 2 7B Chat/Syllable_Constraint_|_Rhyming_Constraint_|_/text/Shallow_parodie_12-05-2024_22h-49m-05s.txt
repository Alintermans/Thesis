[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza should not be theatrical
or do you need more
a topping so sweet andalusian

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm revol
in the toppings we find ourselves longan
for a
taste so unique and flavorful med

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]

or do you need more
a topping so juicy and savion

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in the toppings we find ourselves longing
for a
taste so unique and flavorful med

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the middletown

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the toppings ha shallow
in the toppings shimmy sharbono
in the toppings haavelmo
we're far from the middletown

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the middletown

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
we're off the deep end watch
as we dive in we'll never meatball
we're far from theodore
in the toppings ha shallow
