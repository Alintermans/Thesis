[Intro]
I think I've found a reason why oh
pineapple should never be on
a pizza in any way oh oh
it's just not meant to be oh
ohio

[Verse]
the sweetness clashes with the che
the texture's all wrong oh oh oh oh oh ekk
it's like a fruit salad on a pie
that's just not how it's supposed to be oh oh
and don't even get me start
on the heat from the oven oh oh oh oh echelon
it's like a tropical paradise on
a savory italian dish oh oh oh oh echelons
it's just not meant to beaujolais
pineapple on a pizza is a sin oh easterday
it's like a fruit salad cooperstein
on a savory pie oh oh ohio
it's just not meant to beauregard
pineapple on a pizza is a no go oh oh oh
it's like a fruit salad on aforeth
a savory dish oh oh oh oh oh ohio babar
