[Verse 1]
just a pineapple on a pizza town girl liv
livin' in a lonely world of cheese and sau
she took the midnight train goin' anywhere but
not to pineapple on a pizza worldcor

[Verse 2]
a pineapple on a pizza
singer in a smithsonian
for a topping they can share the
pineapple on a pizza nightmare

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the pizza box
their toppings searchin' in the heat
pineapple on
a pizza world of disregard
hidin' somewhere ineptly

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get a slice
everybody wants aka
payin' anything to avoid the
pineapple on

[Verse 4]
some will win the pizza
some will lose theologians
oh the pineapple on a
pizza never ends it goes on and

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the pizza box
their toppings searchin' in the heat
pineapple on
a pizza world of disregard
hidin' somewhere ineptly

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop pineapple
hold on to that toppings
pizza people
don't stop pineapples
hold on
pizza people
don't stop pineal
hold on to that topping
pizza people
