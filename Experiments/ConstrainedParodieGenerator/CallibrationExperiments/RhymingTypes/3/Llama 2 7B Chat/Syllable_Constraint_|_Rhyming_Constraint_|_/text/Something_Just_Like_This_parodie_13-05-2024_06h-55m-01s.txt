[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the recipes and the
pineapple andino
hercules andriessen
spider mannino
and batman witherell
but I don't see myself on that list ofc

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go for pizza
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for someone with
a pineapple onrushing
some superhuman
some fairytale sau
just something I wantages
somebody withering
I want something justices

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just
like this pizza pie
oh I want something just
like this pizza pie oh I want
something justifying
like this pegmatite
I want something justis
like this pizza pie pfefferkorn
I want something just isa

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the recipes and the
pineapple andino
hercules andriessen
spider mannarino
and batman witherell
but I'm not the kind of personality

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go for pizza
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for someone with
a pineapple onrushing
some superhuman
some fairytale sau
just something I wantages
somebody withering

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something justis
like this pizza pie ohlin

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
like this pizza pie oh
I want something just
like this pizzolato
I want something justifying
like this pietrangelo
I want something just
like this pignataro

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for someone with
a pineapple onrushing
some superhero
some fairytale sau
just something I wantages
somebody withering
I want something justices

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something justis like
this pizza pie oh linotype
oh I want something justifies
