[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate andante
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he orders up a pizza with a surprise
topping that's bound to raise an eye
pineapple on it's not a delight
and she just wants to fight and take africanize
it's a battle of taste buds in a globalize
she's kept track of all the reactions and
guess who just happens to be moving on to another
pizza place with ham and bacon and pepperoni and arafat
'cause she hates the sweet and savour
and you don't put pineapple on a pizza mantei
but she's devised some plan to change the publicize
'cause she loves tradition and gourmet and authentic kenai
so she's been on the web lately
says maybe she'll be my margherita to spite her
man and I know she's using me to try to change the gameplay
hi suzanne but I shoulda said bystander
after the first slice but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate andante
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one bite stand turned a two bite stand it
was come topping time scram now we hug tight and it
he found out now she feels disrespected and
used because he left so what he did it first
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that weissert
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous andert
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person tolbert
so I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners don
t have to be reserved in a booth but
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
is irreversible I preyed on you like it's siniard
and now that I got you I don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to winward
why do I do this st untendered
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'cause now with her in the wom
we can't bring her in this world shoulda knew
to use protection before I bit into your forbidden
food

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate andante
truth and my lies now are
