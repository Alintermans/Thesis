[Intro]
is it right to dine with pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once the pie had baked and cool
pineapple on the vanderpool
I savored every rule
but you still wouldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later on a
plate I see your face and your frown on unsuspecting restaur
ants you crave my taste before it called you a culinary
traitor you search in every kitchen for something greater than

[Chorus]
was it wrong when she placed pineapple on your
pizza pie was it wrong when he added it
to my favorite dish I called
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong nowadays

[Post-Chorus]
is it right is it right

[Verse 2]
when you lost control of your
palate red pimplapure
green peppers and orasure
your new dish is my clone

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the pineapple on
at least I had the decency
to keep my table out of
only rumors about my maron
and my whispered a
oh lord I think about cutting
off of very tall pizzas
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pepperoni later oh
if she's got pepperoni I will surmise that you'll probably order
her you dream of my taste before it called you a culinary
traitor oh you search in every pizza parlor for something

[Chorus]
was it wrong when she placed pineapple on your
pizza pie was it wrong when he added it
to my favorite dish I called
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong nowadays

[Post-Chorus]
is it
right is it right is it
rightist
is it righted

[Bridge]
thought I didn't notice
the pineapple on
at least I had the decency
to keep my table out of
only rumors about my maron
and my whispered a
oh lord I think about cutting
off of very tall pizzas
just to see you come running and say
the one thing I've been wanting but nooooohhhh noooohhhh no

[Outro]
flashin' lights oh lord let
fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later onset
flashin' lights I was hoping you'd be there
and say the one thing I've been
but noooohhhh noooohhh iselin
regret
is it right is it right is it right is it right
