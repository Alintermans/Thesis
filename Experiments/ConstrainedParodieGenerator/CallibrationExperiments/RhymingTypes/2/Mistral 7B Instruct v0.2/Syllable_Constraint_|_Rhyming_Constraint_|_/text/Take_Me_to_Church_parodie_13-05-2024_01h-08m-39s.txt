[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
he's the joke at a barbeque pit
pineapple on a pizza it
I should've objected sooner
if the foodies ever did dec
pineapple's the last true
every slice gets more unitek
a fresh disappointment
we were born with an aversion they
my kitchen offers no relief
he tells me serve it in the kitchen
the only peace I'll be served is when
I'm alone without thelin
I was born with an alexei
command me to be free

[Pre-Chorus]
aaa
amen aka

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a monkey at the shrine of your
pineapple's lies I'll tell you my mistakes and you
can sharpen your knife offer
me that deathless death oh devere
good godlewski
let me give you my life take me to the allure
I'll worship like a monkey at theodorou
I'll tell you my shenberger
offer me that deathless pettigrew

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the good taste
my lover's the pizza
to keep the palate onawa
she demands a chlorinate
rinse the whole sea for something new and
something savory for the main
that's a fine looking delaine
what you got in the oven
we've a lot of starvin' guston
that looks appetizing gonad
this is hunger work

[Chorus]

I'll worship like a monkey at the shrine of your
pineapple's lies I'll tell you my mistakes and you

I'll worship like a monkey at theodorou
I'll tell you my shenberger
offer me that deathless kennebrew

[Bridge]
no masters or kings when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
in the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
only then I am human only then I ameen

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh aka
amen aigner

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a monkey at the shrine of your
pineapple's lies I'll tell you my mistakes and you
can sharpen your knife offer
me that deathless death oh devere
good godlewski
let me give you my life take me to the allure
I'll worship like a monkey at theodorou
I'll tell you my shenberger
offer me that deathless pettigrew
