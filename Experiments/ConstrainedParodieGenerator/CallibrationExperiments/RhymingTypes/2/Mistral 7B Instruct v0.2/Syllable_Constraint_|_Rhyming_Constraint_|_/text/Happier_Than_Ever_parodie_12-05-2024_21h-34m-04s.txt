[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler night
pineapple schiferon

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to ponder something funny
to write myself aponte
a recipe that suits us
do you read my reviews now
or do you skip my menu's av
when you said you'd try chebrikov
was our pizza even
on your takeout list that day I knew ivanov
I asked you to be chill about olaf
but you'd add pineapple on top of that olaf salad andropov
and I'd end up more annoy
don't say itty
pineapple wasn't in your boyarshchik plan that nightly
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now we're happier
pineapple schiferon our pie is right tonight
wishing for a simpler recipe I wish it notified
pineapple free our pal

[Verse 2]
you call me back with a slice in your
hand driving home under the moonlight
you scared me to death with your pineapple breath
but I'm wasting my time cause you only
listen to your pepper friends
I don't relate to you pine
I don't relate to you pine
'cause I'd never treat aol

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk trash about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's just embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me ferdinand
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make meadowland
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line cause you never did bring
the right toppings for our crew I shut them all out for
you cause I was a kid at heart butchering

[Outro]
you ruined our perfect
pizza pie always said misquoted
made all our moments your
own just pineapple leave us alone yeah
ah
goddam
ah
pine
apple
