draggin' back to pineapple's side again
ever thought of ordering
when alexine duplechain
has conradine been trying inane
'cause aol I am too devoted to
this fusion cuisine's design
now I've reconsidered plain
draggin' back tompane
ever thought of re

[Outro]
should I try this combo once again today's test
was sorta hopin' for a taste that wouldn't vex or
displease us both but now I'm second guessing all
the choices made for this culinary disaster
should I wanna know too busy bein' yours to fall
