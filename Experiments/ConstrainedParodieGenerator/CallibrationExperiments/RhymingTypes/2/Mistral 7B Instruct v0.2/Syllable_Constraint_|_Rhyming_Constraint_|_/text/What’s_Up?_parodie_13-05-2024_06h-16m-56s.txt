[Verse 1]
twenty five years with this strange
tryin' to figure out why pineapple on
a pizza is such a
mystery to me and you know I've tried
to understand this bizarre brotherhood of mankind
for the love of pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm taking a bite
just to get it all out what israel
in my head and I feel a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey ey ey
hey heyday
I said hey what's going on with
this pineapple on a
everyday
I said hey heyday meredith

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
and I pine
oh my god iodine
I pine all the time
in this kitchen of life
and I hope
oh my god iodine
I hope every single day
for a counterlife

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm taking a bite
just to get it all out what israel
in my head and I feel a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey ey ey
hey heyday
I said hey what's going on
with this pineapple on
