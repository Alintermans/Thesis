[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta keep it cool because I hate the pineap
it started out on a pie but now it's on a pizza
now I'm cringin' inside and my taste paloma
now I'm fallin' asleep and they're orderin' a
pizza with pineapple and I'm feelin' so sad
now they're savourin' their slice and my appetite
is fadin' away and

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savourin' each bite
with every twilight
let me go
'cause I just can't watch this sight's cruel twist
and takin' a bite

[Chorus]
pineapplesity turning food into
the sea of disappointment
swimmin' through nauseated
lullabies of regret and
but it's just theophila
open up my reluctant
eyes and try to be

[Guitar Solo]
