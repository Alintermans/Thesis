[Intro]
come on folks gather round and let me say this true

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's flavor disinform
I want you to hold out a firm stand against
this fruit that's causing usaid
no debate left
when palate preferences get
in the way we can't be
the pizza pair that's meant to be oh ho

[Chorus]
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same oliphant
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same oliphant
as it was cheviot
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza lovers unocal
why are you arguing at the table
with a pineapple on your
dish in handbell
and no one's coming to save us
from this culinary sad
sack dad just wants to know that we're glad oh ho

[Chorus]
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same oliphant
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same oliphant
as it was cheviot
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home try new toppings fastidious
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave the pineapple far behind us all
I don't wanna talk about who's ordering it

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was as it was not
the same as it was not
