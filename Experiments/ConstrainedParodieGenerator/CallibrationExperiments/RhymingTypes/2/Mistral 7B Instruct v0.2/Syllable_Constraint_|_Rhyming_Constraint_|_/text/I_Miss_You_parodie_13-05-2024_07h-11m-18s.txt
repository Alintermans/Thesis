[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the fruit that ruins allor
the topping on my pizza pie's horror
the unsuspecting palate
of flavor clash and bitter
we can live without pineapple if we want
where you can always finder
and we'll have joy in every bite
and in the night we'll wish this never starts
we'll wish this never starts

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the harmony and I'm so
pained by the thought of pineapple's glow in
my pizza pie's embrace so cold
this bitter fusion
comes creeping on with every bite I've rolled
and as I chew I ponder
the texture and the taste so
savory and sweet side by side it
will you remove this pineapple
and let my pizza be whole
and free from this despair tonight itkin
let myotrophin

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside that
I pine for peace atop
don't add your fruit to me itty
the flavor inside that
I pine for peace atop

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside that
I pine for peace atop
don't add your fruit to me itty
the flavor inside that
I pine for peace atop
don't add your fruit to me itty
the flavor inside that
I pine for peace atop
don't add your fruit to me itty
the flavor inside that
I pine for peace atop

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
