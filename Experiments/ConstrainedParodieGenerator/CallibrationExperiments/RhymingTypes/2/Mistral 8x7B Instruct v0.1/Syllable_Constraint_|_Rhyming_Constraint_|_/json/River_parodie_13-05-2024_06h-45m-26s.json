He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is off\nthe truth and my words now are falling like aco\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with pineapple on his plate\nto catch flack sweat jackets and dress\nslacks mismatched on his breath's a mistake\nhe's a mistake and she just wants to detonate\nit's a war she's on his case like a saturate\nshe's debated and calculated all\nhis mistakes and guess who just happens to hate the taste of\npineapple on pizza well I do and she does too so cannonball\ninto the kitchen and scrap\nit off his pizza she just wants to exact hernandez\non the pineapple and he can't replicate\nthe taste of pizza without pineapple so govpx\nyourself a favor and don't\nadd pineapple to the pizza so let the river\nrun like a river wild and free without pineapple on it so\nlet the river run like a river wilder\nthan a river wild and free andover\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is off\nthe truth and my words now are falling like aco\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one night stand turned a two night stand it\nwas come sunrise scram now we hug tight and yet he\nfound out now she feels tainted and used cause he\nleft so what he did it first to her too it\nhurts to find the words I'm aloof nervous inverted\ncomma and sue don't want this to hurt donated\nto the food bank instead of putting pineapple on the\npizza so let the river run like a river wild and free overbuilt\nwith pineapple on it so let the river run like a river wild\nand free without pineapple oncale\ndon't add pineapple to the pizza so let the\nriver run like a river wilder than a river wildest\ndreams without pineapple on it so goaded\nyourself a favor and don't addict\npineapple to the pizza so let\nthe river run like a river wild and free and\novergrown with pineapple onishi\npizza so let the ri\nver run like a river wild and free andrist\nol without pineapple on it so let the river runny\nbro\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's river my name\n's river\nhey\nriver run\ncall me river o'k\nriver we'll let the river runnion\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the bridesmaid never the bride hey\nfuck can I say if life was asea\nand pineapple was a crime I'd be serving time in five\nlanes speeding on a highway like I'm sliding on ice\nmaybe that's why I can't overdrive\nmy hunger for pineapple\nbut I made you terminate theorize\nmy hunger for pineapple and she can't re\nplicate the taste of pizza without pineap\nple so go ahead and abplanal\npineapple on the pizza so let the ri\nver run like a river wild and free and un\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one\ndonnelly\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\n's gonna do is offend the taste\nthe truth and my words now are falling like ac\n",
