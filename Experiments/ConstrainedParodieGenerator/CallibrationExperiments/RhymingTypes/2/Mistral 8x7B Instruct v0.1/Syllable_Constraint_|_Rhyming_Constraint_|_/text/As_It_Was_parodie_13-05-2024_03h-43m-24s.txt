[Intro]
come on now folks and give an ear to me today

[Verse 1]
taste is key yet
pineapple's ruining it
place it on a slice and watch it all go wrong
why don't we just unocal
cheese and tom sauce
should be the only microsoft
ham and veggies are enough
no need for fruit to bluff oh oh oh o

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same paredes
in this dish oraflex
you know it's not the same parallels
as it was oas
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
it's your taste bud scuppernong
why put pineapple on a pizza ball
it's just not meant to be at
all ringing the
bell and no one comes to save the
day it's just a disarray
on your pizza plate oh oh oh ooohhhooohhho

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same paredes
in this dish oraflex
you know it's not the same parallels
as it was oas
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home and bake a better pie instead
don't wanna talk about the way that it was led
leave the pineapple on the side instead
don't wanna talk about who's doing it ahead

[Outro]
he
in this dish
you know it's not the same jellyfish
in this dish gibberish
