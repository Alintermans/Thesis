[Intro]
I think I've had my fill of that sweet
pineapple on pizza dish we
once shared with glee and laughter now a
ghastly memory I can
never eat

[Verse]
I've tasted two disasters on
my plate and now I see the error of my ways sobon
app√©tit to that mess I'll never say
if I could turn back time I'd keep pineapple
far away from pizza traysome
choose tomato sauce and mozzarella instead of that
sweet and savory combo that I now
regretI've tasted two disasters on my plate andean
ticipate the day unadorn
ed pizza is the only wayI'll savor every bite
and never look back at hamadei
n pineapple againI'll rotational
ly regret that choice andresen
t the taste of pineapple in my mouth again ohland
sacrebleu what a mistake disallow
ing me to see the light of pizza dayagaini donaldson
