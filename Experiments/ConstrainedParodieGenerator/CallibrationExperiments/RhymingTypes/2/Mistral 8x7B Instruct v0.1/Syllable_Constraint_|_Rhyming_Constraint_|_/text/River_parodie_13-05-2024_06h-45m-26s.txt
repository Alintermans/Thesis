[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my words now are falling like aco
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with pineapple on his plate
to catch flack sweat jackets and dress
slacks mismatched on his breath's a mistake
he's a mistake and she just wants to detonate
it's a war she's on his case like a saturate
she's debated and calculated all
his mistakes and guess who just happens to hate the taste of
pineapple on pizza well I do and she does too so cannonball
into the kitchen and scrap
it off his pizza she just wants to exact hernandez
on the pineapple and he can't replicate
the taste of pizza without pineapple so govpx

run like a river wild and free without pineapple on it so
let the river run like a river wilder
than a river wild and free andover
