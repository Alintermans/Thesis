[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
its taste is a cursea bitter
on a slice it does not belong
on a slice it does not belong

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare put it on my dish out spicy
its texture ruins the
harmony of cheese and tomato
harmony of cheese andino

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet pure
pizza was sacred and so sure now
it's tainted by this sweet fruit's reign
I can't abide by this trendy campaign feeling
betrayed by this culinary
travesty that's driving me ins
ane seeing the disunity
of flavors clashing in my brain

[Chorus]
pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice
believer isenhart
pain you've brought me to the brink of tears and rage
my love for pizza will never be
pain you've altered something beautiful

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a plea to the gods of pizza
pineapple williford
betray the sacred trust of pizza oh
betray the sacred trust of no

I was raised on a diet
pizza was sacred noisiest
it's tainted by this disgruntled
fruit's intrusion on a classic
but they never did give in to this trendy fad that
drives me insane seeing the disunity of theodric
flavors clashing

pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice

pain you've brought me to the brink of tears and rage
my love for pizza will never be
pain you've altered something beautiful
believer arehart

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the pizza gods above
pineapple will never be
the face of the future oh

but they never did give in to this trendy fad that
drives me insane seeing the disunity of the flavors
