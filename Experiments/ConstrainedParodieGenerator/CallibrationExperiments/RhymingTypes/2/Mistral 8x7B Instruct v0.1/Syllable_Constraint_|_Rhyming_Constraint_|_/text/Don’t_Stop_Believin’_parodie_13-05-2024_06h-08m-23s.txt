[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and tom
just a foodie born and raised in new york city
pizza lover on a quest to congleton

[Verse 2]
a slice in a crowded pizzer
topped with pineapple andover
for a taste they can't deny
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
lining up and down the street
their hunger searchin' in the night
pizza ovens
baking pies just to find delight
hidin' somewhere underlined

[Verse 3]
working hard to get my fill
everyone wants arousing
paying anything to take a bite
just one more slice

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
some are born to eatable
oh the meal never ends it
goes on and on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
lining up and down the street
their hunger searchin' in the night
pizza ovens
baking pies just to find delight
hidin' somewhere underlined

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating it
hold on to that feeling
pizza ovens
don't stop hobbyist
hold on
pizza owen
don't stop trombonist
hold on to that feeling
pizza owen
