[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue and mad
wish I could explain it flatland
pineapple andante

[Verse 1]
give me hours to devise a plan so wise and fine
to keep pineapple divine
from touching my pizza pie
did you read my rants online
or do you turn a blind eye to
the fact that pineapple isa
disaster on a pizza
don't say it's just a phase you're going through bru
you clearly weren't aware theora
pineapple's a culinary sin so if you really wanna du
know the truth I'm here to say
that pineapple maritime
should never be combined with pizza time oh no no
it's a crime against my taste bud

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue and
wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't
true mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm trueblo
andante mm mm mm true

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask me to add
pineapple to my pizza slice and
I just hang up the phone and say no way no
how could you do this to me manigat
you know I hate pineapple
you know I hate pineapple you
know I hate pineapple you know
I hate pineapple ono

[Verse 3]
and I don't spread lies about pineapple online or
in real life I just avoid it like the
plague because it's just not right it's a shameful sight
so don't try to force me topsy
turvy and don't try to change my mind
I'll never ever put pineapple
on my pizza kindly leave it behind oh no no no no
pineapple's a crime against mankind oh no no no
it's a sin it's a shame it's a disgrace oh no no no
it's a disaster on a pizza plateau

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just leave me alone with my pizza dough
oh
ah ah
