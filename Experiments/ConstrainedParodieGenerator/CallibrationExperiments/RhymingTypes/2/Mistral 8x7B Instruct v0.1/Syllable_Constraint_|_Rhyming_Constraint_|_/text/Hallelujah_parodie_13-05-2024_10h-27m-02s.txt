[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for it do ya pov
it goes like this the dough the sauce
the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the baffled chef adds pineapple to it

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco

[Verse 2]
your taste was fine but you needed proof
you tried it once and shatterproof
your trust in pizza crust was broken in two
it weighed you down and made you sigh
you couldn't eat it and wondered high
if pizza with pineapple was really true

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco

[Verse 3]
you say it's just a trend in vain
it's not the same as sugarcane
but if you tried it you might see it through an
other's eyes and change your mind a bit and
even though it all tandycraft
you'll stand before the pizza gods and say it

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste it so I sausage
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the fireball
with nothing on my tongue but pineapple no

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no pozo
pineapple no no verrastro
pineapple no no verdugo
pineapple no no verduzco
pineapple no no nabisco
pineapple no no nintendo
pineapple no no narciso

[Outro]
pineapple no no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I dittemore
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pineapple on the mar
garlic knots but love itamar
it's not a victory march it's a broken pine

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I bbq
the holy cheese was oahu
and every bite we drew was pineapple no

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a taste above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who hashemite
it's a cold and it's a broken pineapple no
