[Verse]
emerging from my denial and I've been doing
fine without that taste I've been declininguh u
stuck in my ways and I've been refusingthat slice so bland
it started with a bite but now I understand
it's a travesty to put pineapple on a
pizza base it's just a waste of space and taste it
clashes with the sauce and makes my stomach churnin
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're still defending it
I'll never conceded
let it go
it's just not right and it's spreading like a
disease and taking

[Chorus]
jealousy I see their love for pine on
pizzas drowning in deniers
ignoring alligators
it's just the price we pay for
ignorance calling inborn
open up my openers
cause I'm mr no

[Guitar Solo]
