[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we
must face this culinary war
you might think it's tasty but it's a flawed notion
it looks absurd on a pie
it's just not right my friend oh

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but thesaurus
is lacking words to describe unconcern
for taste preferences

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
reject this topping herbalist
we gotta get away from this fungi
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from this

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice with a grin on
it's a misguided attempt
to elevate your pizza
remember the classics will always be
the best choice we can make from
the pizza paranoia

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but thesaurus
is lacking words to describe unconcern
for taste preferences

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
reject this topping herbalist
we gotta get away from this fungi we
must get away from this fungi
we gotta get away from that

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but thesaurus
is lacking words to describe unconcern
for taste preferences

[Bridge]
we don't savor the
taste of tradition
we should open our
minds and expand hor
izons beyond this
pineapple obliv

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on us
we gotta get away
we got to get away from this mistake today
we got to get away from this mistake today
we got to get away orsay
we got to get away orsay
we got to get away oday
