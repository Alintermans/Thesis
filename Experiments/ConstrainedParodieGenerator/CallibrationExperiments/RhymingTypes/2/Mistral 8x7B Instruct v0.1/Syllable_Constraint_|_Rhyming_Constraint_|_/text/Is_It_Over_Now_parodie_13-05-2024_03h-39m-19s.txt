[Intro]
pineapple on pizza pie oh say is

[Verse 1]
once the box was opened wide
cheese and sauce mixed inside upright
my stomach turned andesite
pineapple should not

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later I see
your pizza's topped with chunks of pineapple on bended knee you
dream of sweet and savory but it's just not right forgery
you search for taste sensation but it's just not there for me baby

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they first put pineapple on
was it wrong when they said it'd be gone in
a bite or two but still it ling
ers on my tongue like a bad omen
was it wrong then and is it wrong now no way

[Post-Chorus]
no way oh say is it

[Verse 2]
when the taste took hold of me
ham and pineapple sway
together incessantly
a culinary trav

[Bridge]
and did you think I'd like it did you
think I'd crave the taste
at least I had the decency
to keep my mouth from such a
disaster oh lord I contemplate
avoid consummate
pineapple on pizza never
taste again just to escape
the bitter taste of pine on
my taste buds no way no how no never no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizzerias later if
they got pineapple I will turn away oh no you'll never deceptive
me with sweet and savory again no way no how iosif
it's over then and is it over now no way no how no way

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they first put pineapple on
was it wrong when they said it'd be gone in
a bite or two but still it ling
ers on my tongue like a bad omen
was it wrong then and is it wrong now no way

[Post-Chorus]
no way
oh say is it no way
noaa
oh iodice

[Bridge]
think I'd like It think I
crave the taste at least
I had the decency to keep
my mouth from such a taste bud
disaster oh lord I contemplate
avoid comandeered
pineapple on pizza never
taste again just to escape
the bitter taste of pine on my taste
buds no way no how no never no way no

[Outro]
oh say is it no way
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizzas later o
h say I was hoping you'd be there and
say the one thing I've been want
ing no way notochord
