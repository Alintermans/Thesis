[Intro]
is it a crime to put pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once I had a pie that was
sweet and savory allomorph
I slept all alone inla
dreams of hawaiian

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza orders later
I see your toppings and your smile on unsuspecting chefs oh
you dream of my crust before it called you a lying traitor
you search in every pizza joint for somethin' greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when I added pineapple
was it over when I put it in the o
I whispered in your ear in your
dream as you passed out baby was it
over then and is it over now oh lord

[Post-Chorus]
uh huh is it a crime

[Verse 2]
when I lost my mind and put
pineapple on afoot
red sauce and mozzarella
a perfect blend of sweet

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you
there were flashin' lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza orders
out of sight only rumors abides
my toppings sidel
oh lord I think about jumpin
off of very tall pizza
just to see you come runnin
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
