[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is
a topping that's just not right in my eyesaid it's a crime
do you ever get that feeling that you
can't shift the tide of disgust
are there some toppings up your sleeve that you
haven't tried to make it more bearable to chewsa
I've dreamt about pineapple ju
how many secrets
can you keep before you start to spewsaid it's a fad that's just
not worth the hype it's given in the media

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from the che
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for toppings that donaway

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
origin of the pizza
ever thought of
callin' itty
busy beefy
too busy bein'sau
to fall for arizmendi
now I thoughtfully
crawlin' toiletry

[Verse 2]
so have you got the gut
been wonderin' if your heart's still open
and if so I wanna know what astringent
simmer down and pucker up I'm sorry to interrupt
it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to avoid
but I don't know if you feel the same as I do
but we could be toppings if you wanted to no

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from the che
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for toppings that donaway

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the origin of the

too busy bein' sau noisily
fall for arizmendi now I thoughtful
crawlin' toiletry away from
pineapple oncology
now I thoughtfully

[Outro]

was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from the che
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for toppings that donaway
to fall for arizmendi now I thoughtfully craw
