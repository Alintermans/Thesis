[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the topping from mynhier
the sweetness in the nightmare of my taste
the disgusting addition
to the pizza that I hate
we can live without pineapple if we want
and avoid the aftertaste
of disappointment and regret in
the night we'll wish this never ends we'll wish
this never ends amish

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor going to
I cannot eat this pizza without a
I need something more substantial
and less acidic
this sickly sweetness creeping on me again
like a virus in my gut
and as I chew I counted
the bites of disappointment and dis
the tang of regret in my mouth
will you take it away and
stop this pineapple pain ton ianthe
stop this pinochet

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
it's already lost its
flavor and appeal don
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
it's already lost its
flavor and appeal don

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
it's already lost its
flavor and appeal don
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
it's already lost its
flavor and appeal don
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
it's already lost its
flavor and appeal don
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
it's already lost its
flavor and appeal don

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
