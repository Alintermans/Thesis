[Verse 1]
just a pineapple on a pizza town girl liv
livin' in a lonely world of cheese and sau
she took the midnight train goin' anywhere but
not to pineapple on a pizza inlaw

[Verse 2]
a pineapple on a pizza
singer in a smoky pita
for a topping they can share the
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the toppings bar
their tastebuds searchin' in the
pizza toppings
livin' just to find flavorful
hidin' somewhere ineptly

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get a slice
everybody pesticides
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more to

[Verse 4]
some will win with pepper
some will lose with meltwater
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the toppings bar
their tastebuds searchin' in the
pizza toppings
livin' just to find flavorful
hidin' somewhere ineptly

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop toppin' hold
on to that flavorful
pizza toppings
don't stop toppin' hold
on to
pizza toppins
don't stop to towbo
hold on to that flavell
pizza topix
