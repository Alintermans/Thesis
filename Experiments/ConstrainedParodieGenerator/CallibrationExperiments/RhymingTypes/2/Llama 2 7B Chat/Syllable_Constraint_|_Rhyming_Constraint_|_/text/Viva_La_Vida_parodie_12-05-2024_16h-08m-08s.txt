[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to crave the taste
of pineapple on my pancaked
now I see the error of my ways
pineapple doesn't belong

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to think it was
a tropical delight butterball
now I know it's a culmin
crime against humanity peterkin
pineapple on a pizza
just can't abiola
listen as the toppings sing in harmon
pineapple doesn't belong here withington

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
hear the pizza bells a ringin' out of
tune pineapple doesn't belong here
be my shield and sword against the
abomination of arizmendi
my missionaries in a foreign
field of pizza pineapple
never an honest to
god why pineapple onawa

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild wind
blew away my pineapple dream
shattered the illusion of a taste
that didn't belong on a pizza scheme
people couldn't believe their
eyes when they saw theatergoer
pineapple on a pizza in a foreign
field of pineapple pizza crusade

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
hear the pizza bells a ringin' out of
tune pineapple doesn't belong here
be my shield and sword against the
abomination of arizmendi
my missionaries in a foreign
field of pizza pineapple nebraskan
