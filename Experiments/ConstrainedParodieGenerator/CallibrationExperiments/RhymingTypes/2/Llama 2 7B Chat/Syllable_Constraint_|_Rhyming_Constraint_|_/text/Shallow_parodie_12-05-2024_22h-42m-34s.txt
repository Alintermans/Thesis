[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza should not be the thing to do
it's a crime against
good taste and decency alien

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
we're falling
in the pizza paradox we findling
for the
right toppings and the wrong toppings col

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
ain't you tired of the sweet and the
sour on top of
the cheese and the sauce and the blickenstaff

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
we're falling
in the pizza hole we findling forew
the right
toppings and the wrong toppings collide

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the che
crust again crash through the toppings where they can
taste us no more shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pizza haze we find
in the pizza haze we falsified
in the pizza lazulite
we're far from the cheesy now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh aka

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the che
crust again crash through the toppings where they can
taste us no more shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
we're off the deep end watch
as we dive in the pizza disgorge
we'll never meet the nor
melted cheese again crash through
