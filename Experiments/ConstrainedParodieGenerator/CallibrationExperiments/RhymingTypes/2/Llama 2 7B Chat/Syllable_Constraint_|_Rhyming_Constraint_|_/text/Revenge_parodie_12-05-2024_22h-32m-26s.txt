[Intro]
I think I've found a reason why oh
pineapple should never be on
a pizza in any way oh oh
it's just not meant to be oh
ohio

[Verse]
the sweetness clashes with the che
the texture's all wrong oh oh oh oh oh ekk
it's like a fruit salad on a pie
that's just not how it's supposed to be oh oh
and don't even get me start
on the heat from the oven oh oh oh oh oh eek oh
it's like a tropical paradise on
a savory italian dish oh oh oh oh eberhardt
pineapple has its perrier
but on a pizza it's a no go oh oh easterday
ohio ohio ohio
ohio ohio ohio ego
ohio ohio oh god
ohio ohio ohio ego eeo
ohio ohio ohio e
ohio ohio ohio eeo eberhard

[Chorus]
pineapple should not
be on aforeth
it's just not meant to be oh
ohio oh ho
ohio oh ohio
ohio oh ho

[Outro]
ohio oh oh
ohio ohio
ohio oh oh oh
ohio oh oh iago
oh oh
