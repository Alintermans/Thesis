flack for his toppings choices he
sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched for
on his breath jack he's a pineapple addiction

jetpack she's kept track of all his pizza toppings and guess
who just happens to be movin' on to the next actually just
shit on my last pizza and
she has what my ex lacks love danger psychopath andy
you don't fuck with no man's pizza even I
know that but she's devised some plan to top him ineptly

says maybe she'll be my pepperoni to spite her man I know

cause he left so what he did it first to her
too now how am I supposed to tell this pizzazier
I don't want to hurt but what you desrosier

person to you revert to the studio like hole in theatergoer
don't have to be reserved in a booth I just feel like the person
