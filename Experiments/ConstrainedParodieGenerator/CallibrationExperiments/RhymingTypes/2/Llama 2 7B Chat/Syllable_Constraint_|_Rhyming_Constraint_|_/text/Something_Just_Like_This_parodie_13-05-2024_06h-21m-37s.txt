[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the recipes and the
pineapple andrepont
hercules andretti
spiderman's control
and batman with hisey
but I don't see myself on that list of pineapp

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna gooosome sweet and
how much you wantta risk
I'm not looking for something that
tastes like a tropical night
some super deland
some fair deified
just something I can turn to
somebody iodide
I want something justified

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh ohio
I want something justified no
oh oh oh oh oh no
oh oh oh oh no
oh oh oh noverco
I want something just notaro
oh oh oh oh nobuo

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the recipes and the
pineapple andrepont
hercules andretti
spiderman's control and
batman with his eyrie
but I'm not the kind of personality

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna gooosome sweet and
how much you wantta risk
I'm not looking for something that
tastes like a tropical night
some super deland
some fair deified
just something I can turn to
somebody iodide

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh ohio

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh ohio
I want something just notaro
oh oh oh oh noto
oh oh oh noxso
I want something justo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
tastes like a tropical night
some superhero
some fair fantasized
just something I can turn to
somebody iodide
I want something justified

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh ohio
oh oh oh oh oh noverco
