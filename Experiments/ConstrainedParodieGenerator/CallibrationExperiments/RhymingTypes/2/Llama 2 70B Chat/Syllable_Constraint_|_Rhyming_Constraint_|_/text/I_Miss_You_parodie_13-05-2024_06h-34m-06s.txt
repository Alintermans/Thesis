[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I protest against the

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on my pizza israel
the topping in the oven of despair
the burning sensation in
my mouth that I cannot bear
we can't have a slice of paradise with
pineapple on theater
and in the night we'll wish this never
ends we'll wish this never ends pineapple
on pizza nightengale

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss u

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor and I'm so
sorry I cannot taste It tonight I
need a pizza that's pure and true
and not this abom
ination that comes creeping on so haunting
every time and as I
stare I'm counting the seconds
till I can spit it out like a bad
decision to put pineapple
on a pizza and hear the
voice of reason will you come alumni
and stop this fungi

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's all
already ruined the
taste don't waste your time
on pineapple it's all already tesol
ated donatelli

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]

time on pineapple it
already ruined the taste don't waste on
pineapple already

waste your time on pineapple it's alberthal
