[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolish man and made
a mess of things that cannot
be undone and now it's time to pay the price for my mistakes
I've been a liar and a cheat and now it's time to face
the truth and let the river run
let the river run and wash away theism
that I've held onto for

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've been a pizza lover for a long time
but now I see the error of
my ways and I'm ready to make a
change and let go of my cravings for aol
pineapple on my pizza is like alexine
in a love triangle with john and ed
it's a betrayal to the art of pizza making and
I'm ready to admit that I was wrong and move on from disrespect
move on from the pain that I
caused and start fresh with a new pie in my hand aversive
to the thought of pineapple on my pantomime
it's time to let the river run and wash away my gu
and let the river run and was
away my guilt and shame for ever craving such a
blasphemous topping on my pizza pie it's time to move on and
embrace the truth and let the river runway
the river run and wash away allay

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolish man and made

let the river run and wash away theism
that I've held onto for

I know that I've hurt those who I hold dear
with my selfish desires and my lack of fear
of the consequences of my actions but

amends and start anew and let the river run its
course and wash away my past mistakes and sauerteig
I'm ready to embrace the truth and let the river run
