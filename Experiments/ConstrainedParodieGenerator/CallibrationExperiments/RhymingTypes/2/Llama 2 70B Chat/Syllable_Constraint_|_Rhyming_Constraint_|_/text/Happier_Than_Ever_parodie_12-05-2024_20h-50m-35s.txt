[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain hainline
why it's such ariel

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to collect my thought iain ough
to write a song redenbaugh
about why pineapple doesn
t belong on a piechart
you think it's fancy and unique
but it's just a mistake tony
do you even read the men
or do you just skip the rules tony mozambique
when you said you were hungry chesapeake
I knew you'd mess it up chesapeake bay bridge tunnel iain tony
you'd do the opposite of
what you said you'd deffenbaugh
and I'd end up feeling sick iain tony tony
don't say it isn't fair ough

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain hainline why it's such a
riel so if you really wanna know iain tony treadaway
tell me why you'd put that on

[Verse 2]
you call me up drunk in your benzo
bragging bout your pineapple pizza
you scared me to death but I'm wasting my breath
cause you only listen tolentino
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
cause I'd never treat me this poor
you made me hate this dunsmoor

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
cause that shit's embarrassing you were my pizza
and all that you did was make me ferdinand
sad so don't waste the time I don't
have and don't try to make me feel
bad I could talk about every time that you showed up on
time but I'd have an empty line cause you never did
never paid any mind to my toppings or crust so I
shut em all out for you cause I was aided

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin leave me alone yeah fuck you
ah
goddam
ah
fuck you
fuck you
