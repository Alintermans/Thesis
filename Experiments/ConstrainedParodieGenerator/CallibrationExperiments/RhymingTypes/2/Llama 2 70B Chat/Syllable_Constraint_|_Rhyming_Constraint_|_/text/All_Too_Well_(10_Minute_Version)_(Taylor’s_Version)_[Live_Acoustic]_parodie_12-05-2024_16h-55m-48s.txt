[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up andover

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory cravings we
ordered a pie with pepperoni and sa
but then you said you wanted pineapple onni
and I was like what the heck islamically

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's not my place
but I had to say someth
pineapple on pizza is a crime against taste
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the pizza shop
you're ordering something that makes me want to stop eating meat
wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza on the menu with pineapple
you used to be a little kid with a big appetite forrestal
and your mother's telling stories bout you and your love for anch
you told me bout your cravings thinking your future was
meat eating pizza with pineapple on top it allomorph
key chain on the ground we were always skipping town
and I was thinking on the drive down any time now
he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it was
til we were dead and gone andbur
ied check the pulse and come back swearing it's the
same after three months in the
grave and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for
you but all I felt was shame and you held myslinski

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an
oath sacred pedicures
we'd swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paperlying
here cause I remember it all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fin
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you not
weeping in a party bathroom some
actress asking me what happened you po
that's what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self effacing jo
kes sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come
and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying tumescent
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like
me you can't get rid of
it cause you remember it all too

[Chorus]
cause there we are again when I loved you
so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well wind in my hair you were
there you remember it
all down the stairs you were
there you remember it
all it was rare I was
there I remember itochu

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your lovers stay my age
from when your brooklyn broke my stereos
and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half
her weight and did the twin flame bruise paint
you blue just between us did the love affair ma
im you too cause in this cit
y's barren cold I still remember the
first fall of snow and how it gli
stened as it fell I redeye

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it alpharel
too just between us I remember it all too well samuelle
