[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza
toppings would pile high andria
now my stomach's all empty and sad
cravings for something badland

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to think pepper
was the king of toppings andover
but then I tried pineapple
and my taste buds started to litteral
I hear the flavors clashing
like a war infiltrating
my mouth's a battlefield and I can't
stand the thought of it no more ia ronstadt

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringin' ict
culinary experts choirs are sing
be my mirror my pizza and
shield my taste buds from the abuse myhand
for some reason I can't explain
pineapple doesn't belong
never an honest slice
but that's when I ruled theorize

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild cra
ving that blew down the doors to let
me in shattered pizza boxes and
the sound of drums people couldn't believe
what I'd become a pineap
ple revolutionary wait
for my slice on a silver plate ict mmmm a
who would ever wanna be king of

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringin' ict
culinary experts choirs are sing
be my mirror my pizza and
shield my taste buds from the abuse myhand
for some reason I can't explain
pineapple doesn't belong cullinane
never an honest slice
but that's when I ruled theorize
