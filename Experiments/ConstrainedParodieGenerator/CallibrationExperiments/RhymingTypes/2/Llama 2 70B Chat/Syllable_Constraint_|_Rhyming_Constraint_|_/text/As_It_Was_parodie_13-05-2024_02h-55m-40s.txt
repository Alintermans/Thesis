[Intro]
come on pineapple lovers we wanna say good

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pineapple's on pfefferkorn
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
why don't we leave it at that
nothin' to say
when everything gets allende
seems you cannot be replaced
and I'm the one who will stay oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world pineapple
you know it's not the same asiel
in this world pineal
you know it's not the same usable
as it was ariel
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the phone
pineapple you aiton
why are you sitting at home on the floor
what kind of pills are you on
ringin' the bell
and nobody's coming to help
your daddy lives by himself
he just wants to know that you're well oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world pineapple
you know it's not the same asiel
in this world pineal
you know it's not the same usable
as it was ariel
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home get ahead lightspeed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave america two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was agresource
