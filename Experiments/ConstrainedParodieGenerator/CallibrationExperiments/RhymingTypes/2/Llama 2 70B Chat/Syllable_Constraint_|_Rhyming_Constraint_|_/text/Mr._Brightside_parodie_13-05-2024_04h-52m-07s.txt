[Verse]
comin' out of my pizza joint and I've been doin'just
gotta gotta have a slice because I want it
it started out with a topping how did it end up like
it was only a topping it was only a
now I'm fallin' asleep and my stomach is sick
and it's all in my head pineapple should not be
on a pizza it's just not right it's a crime it
makes me wanna cry it

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's touchin' my tongue now
it takes away the flav
let me go
because I just can't taste it's killin
me and it's takin

[Chorus]
pineapple turnin' pizza into a
swimmin' through sick flavors cho
kin' on your alamito
but it's just the price I pay
destiny isadore
open up my savino
'cause I'm mr pizza
