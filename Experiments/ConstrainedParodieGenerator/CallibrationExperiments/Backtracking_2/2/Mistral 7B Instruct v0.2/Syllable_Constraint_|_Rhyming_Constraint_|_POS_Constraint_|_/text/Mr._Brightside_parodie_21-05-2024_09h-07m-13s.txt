[Verse]
comin' out of my kitchen and I've been doin' just
gotta hide in the corner because pineapple
started out on the piecrustbut ended up on the dish
it was only a topping it was only a
now I'm makin' a face and they're packin' it up
while he savors a slice and she's takin' a bite
now they're enjoyin' their meal and my appetite's
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's slicing his pizza
he savors hisada
let me go
'cause I just can't eat it brings me to tears
and takin' control

[Chorus]
pineapple prejudiceturning a
swimmin' through sick recipes
chokin' on your pine alley
but it's just the price I pay
destination isaiah
open up my determined
'cause I'm mr topping

[Guitar Solo]
