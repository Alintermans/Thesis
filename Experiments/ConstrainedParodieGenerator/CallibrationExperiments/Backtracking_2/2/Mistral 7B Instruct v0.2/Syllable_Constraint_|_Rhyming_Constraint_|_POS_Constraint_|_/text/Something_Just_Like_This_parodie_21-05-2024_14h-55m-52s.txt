[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading labels on
the foods that we consume
pepperoni oran
cheese and tomato blo
vegetarian
pineapple on a lo
but I'm not that kind of eater that it goes with flow

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said grab a slice or two
how adventurous can
I'm not looking for a meal with
some exotic flavor plan
a culinary
a tropical twist
just something simple I can
enjoy without ahlqu
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo du du doo du du
doo du du doo du
doo du du dobrinja
oh I want something just like this
doo du du dobrinja
doo du duena
doo du du do branda
oh I want something just like this
doo du du doo dukakis

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading labels on
the foods that we consume
anchovies and capon
jalape√±o and gu
acai bowl vegan food
pineapple not in view
but I'm not the kind of person that it suits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said come on try something new
why not be a little
I'm not looking for a meal with
some spicy surprise in it
a culinary
a bold invention
just something simple I can
appreciate without

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo du du doo du du
doo du du doo du
doo du du dobrinja
oh I want something just like this
doo du du dobrinja
doo du duena
doo du du do branda

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a meal with
some unusual taste in
a culinary
a curious blend
just something simple I can
appreciate without
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
