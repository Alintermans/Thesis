[Intro]
is it pineapple on a pizza night

[Verse 1]
once the meal was maderight
with the taste of savory bit
but you insisted nolet
pineapple on it

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand slices later tonight
I see the pineapple chunks on your plate so inconsider
you crave my pepperoni before it labeled anorthite
you search in every chef's menu for something better righteous

[Chorus]
was it tasty when it touched your tonguethat
was it tasty when it splashed your platewith
put a pineapple ring around
in your dream as you groaned out aloud
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it is it is it

[Verse 2]
when you tried to combineall
tomatoes and hamal
pineapple on aerial
your new palate is me

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you
adding pineapple
at least I had the dignity
to keep our traditions
only rumors about our che
and my whispered ve
oh pineapple I think about
throwing it away from me
just to see you come running
and declare the one thing I've been wanting but

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand arguments later ohno
if it's got pineapple rings I will surmise that you'll probably partlow
you crave my pepperoni before it labeled anorth ito
you search in every recipe for something greater righteous

[Chorus]
was it tasty when it landed on your tongue
was it tasty when it dripped your platedown
put a pineapple ring around
in your dream as you sighed out aloud
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it is it is it
islet
is it islet

[Bridge]
think I didn't see you
adding pineapple
at least I had the dignity
to keep our traditions
only rumors about our che
and my whispered ve
oh pineapple I think about
throwing it away from me
just to see you come runningupright
and declare the one thing I've been wanting but
