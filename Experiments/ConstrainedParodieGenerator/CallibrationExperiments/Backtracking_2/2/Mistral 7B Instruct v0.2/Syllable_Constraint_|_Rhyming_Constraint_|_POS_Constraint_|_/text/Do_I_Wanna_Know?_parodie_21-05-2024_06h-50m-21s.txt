[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever fear that it ruins pizza's harmony
it lingers on like something in your sne
are there some toppings that are more
should you have no idea that it's a
disaster waiting to unfold on your plate this e
how many food fights cancilla
'cause there's this pizzai found
that makes me shudder in disgust an' I avoid it on repe
until I lose my appetiteand spill my sauce

[Pre-Chorus]
has pineapple got a place on the pie's surface
was sorta hopin' it wouldn't invade our tur
fellow pizza lovers know that the nights were made
for relishing flavors that clash tomorrow incur

[Chorus]
scuttling back to
ever thought of ordering
when you cratia
'cause I always do
maybe ita
pesky being pine
to fall for another new
now I've thought ia
scuttling back to

[Verse 2]
have you got the courage
questioning if the pineapple's worth the
and if so I wanna know what hour it
settle down an' give it a try it's just I'm constantly
on the brink of regretting adding it to the dish I'm in
but we could be harmonious if you agree in
but we could be delicious if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
has pineapple got a place on the pie's surface
was sorta hopin' it wouldn't invade our tur
fellow pizza lovers know that the nights were made
for relishing flavors that clash tomorrow incur

[Chorus]
scuttling back to you scuttling back

maybe it's too pesky being pine a
to fall for another flavor
to satisfy my tarmac

[Outro]

was sorta hopin' it wouldn't invade our tur
fellow pizza lovers know that the nights were made
for relishing flavors that clash tomorrow incur
