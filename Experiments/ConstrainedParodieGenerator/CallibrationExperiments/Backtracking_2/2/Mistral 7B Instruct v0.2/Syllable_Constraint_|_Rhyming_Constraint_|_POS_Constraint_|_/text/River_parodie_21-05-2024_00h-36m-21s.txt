he brings it home sliced on his pizza plate to
jack daniels and tomato sauce
but she hates it with a passion so
it's a battle in the kitchen heated andrew
he insists it complements the flavor sheila
but she says it's an abomination
and uses her spatula as a weapon in hand with
determination to ban this intruder in the pantry and land
because she craves tradition
it's a test of wills a culinary warfare act two
she's kept track of all his orders online ata
grocery store app and guess who just happens to order
pineapple on his pizza pie
actually just bought one from guy number three to
prove a point and she has what my ex lacked oh dear me oh dear me
cause she's a traditionalist andrea
and you don't put pineapple on a

[Verse 2: Eminem]
one night order turned into a two night
it was love at first sight now we argue and fight
he found out now she feels disrespected and
because he gave in to her demands and then
now how am I supposed to apologize forsgren
it's hard to find the right words I'm emotional and
I just can't bring myself to say it in person to
so I retreat to the kitchen like a lonely chef's table and bergren
I just feel like the person I'm becoming is irreversible
I regretted my decision tofu
get on my soapbox and preach my anti pineapple
speech and now that I've got you I don't want you anymore
took advantage of your love for pizza to
pressure you into trying something new
why do I do these things that I do
get on my culinary pedestal and pro
detergent and bleach is burning the wound
because now with you in
we can't make this dish work together should
have used preservatives before I took a bite of your for
ban

love can I say if pizza isautier
but I made you terminate our growing family
this pineapple triangle left us in a messy
what else can I say it was fun for a
bet I really woulda loved
didn't really wanna disappoint her
but what's one more lie to tell our unborn child
our love triangle left us in a wreck
tangled what else can I say itek
I just feel like the person I'm becoming
is irreversible I took advantage

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pirate leading a
been a jester causing a

well little one I don't want to lie
if all it

so let the river run on and on and on and
so let the river run
