[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a recipe for peace of mind
but then you put that pineapple on
my beloved pizza pie un
bound unwound

[Verse]
I've ordered two delivery
orders for our love story's endlessly rarity
oh gosh who knew pineapple's sour
taste could sour our love hour after
hour after hour after
but if I had a chance to turn back timewould I choose
to take that pineapple off your pizza
and keep our love alive or lose it all again in this
our ongoing pizza war
I've ordered two delivery orders for our love
our love's endless storyteller
oh gosh who knew pineapple's sour taste ter
could sour our love hour
after hour after hour after hour after
but if I had a chance to turn back time
would I choose to take that pineapple off your pizza andis

[Chorus]
off your pizza pie
off your pizza pie
off your pizza pie I'd lie
off your pizza pie
off your pizza pie defy
off your pizza pie

[Outro]
off your pizza pie
off your pizza pie I
can't deny our
our love's demise wasmer
merely
