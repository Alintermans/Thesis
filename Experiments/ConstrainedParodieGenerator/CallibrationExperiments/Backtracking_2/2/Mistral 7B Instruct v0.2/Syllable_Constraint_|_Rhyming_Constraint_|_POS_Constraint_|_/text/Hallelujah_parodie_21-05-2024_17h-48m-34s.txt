[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that hillary made and it raffish
but you don't really crave for pineapple do
it goes like this the third the sixth
the sour rise the sweet decline
the confused chef composing inner turmo

[Chorus]
hallelujah pittsburgh hallel
hallelujah hallelujah

[Verse 2]
your taste was strong but you demanded
you saw the pineapple onstad
its sweetness in the oven overwhelmed ya
they smothered your pizza in a
they blinded you with their topeka
and from your slice they drew the hollow hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pittsburgh hallel
hallelujah hallelujah

[Verse 3]
you say I introduced the fruit
I don't even know the fruit
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a stain on every topping in
it doesn't matter which younkin
the pure or the contaminated hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pittsburgh hallel
hallelujah hallelujah

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I tried to touch
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord dejon
with nothing on my plate but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pittsburgh hallel
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallel juul
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
hallelujah pittsburgh hallel

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this table I've walked this
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your label on the pepper
love is not a victory fe
it's a cold and it's a bitter hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never taste it to me do you
and remember when I moved into
the savory dove wasiyu
and every bite we drew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to hate someone who outcooked you
and it's not a sigh that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen allright
it's a cold and it's a bitter hallelujah
