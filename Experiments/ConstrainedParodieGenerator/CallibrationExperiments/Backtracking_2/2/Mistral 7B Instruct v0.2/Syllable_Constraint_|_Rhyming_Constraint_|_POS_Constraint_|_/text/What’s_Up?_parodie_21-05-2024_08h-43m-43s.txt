[Verse 1]
twenty years with this endless
struggle to remove that pineapple pester
from the savory dish
I tried to reason with those who insist
that this tropical fruit adds flavor to blissful dish
but what does it mean to

[Pre-Chorus]
so I sigh sometimes when I'm standing at the stove
just to get it all out what's within ro
and I weary of being this particular
and so I step outside the kitchen and I take a
deep breath and I get high on my principles
and I shout with all my mighty lungs
what's happening

[Chorus]
and I say heyayaheyayahey

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I stand at the stove
just to get it all out what's within ro
and I weary of being this particular
and so I step outside the kitchen and I take a
deep breath and I get high on my principles
and I shout with all my mighty lungs
