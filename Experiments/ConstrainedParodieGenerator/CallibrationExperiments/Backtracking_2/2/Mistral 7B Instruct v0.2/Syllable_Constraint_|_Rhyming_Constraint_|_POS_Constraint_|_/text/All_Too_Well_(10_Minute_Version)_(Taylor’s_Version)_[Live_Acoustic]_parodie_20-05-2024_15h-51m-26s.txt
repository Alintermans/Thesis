[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it wasn't right somehow
a slice of pineapple on your pizza pie
now ruins the taste for me every time

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple on a pizza it's a mystery
we can't agree as we argue end less
falling leaves piling up around us near misses
and I can't picture it after alli

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
this food debate will never
end but I'll try to move on all the same all the
same all the

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the crowded pizza
shop you almost choked on a piece of pineapple tossed at me
condiments in my hair it
was a nightmare I remember

[Verse 3]
toppings galore on the counter you were turning red faced
you used to be a simple cheese and tomato baseboy in a
twin sized bedtime story told by your mother about you on
the soccer team and you told me about your passion
and your love for pineapple on a pizza piekey ringen
pepperoni on the floor we were arguing
and I was thinking on the drive home any minute
you'd admit it's a mistake but you never called it what
it was til we were done and gone
buried six feet deep checked the pulse and came back
swearing it's the same after
six months in the grave and then you wondered where it went to
as I reached for you but all I felt was shame and you

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
this food debate will never end
but I forget about it long enough
to remember why I hated

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the supermarket a
isle filled with disagreement you kept me like a secret a
promise to remember
it was a curse I remember
toppings galore I was there you remember it all
toppings galore we were there you remember it allall
curse I remember it
toppings galore I was there you were

[Bridge]
maybe we got lost in translation or
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
until you changed it
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to start an argument all
over again oh so casually cruel in the name
of being honest I'm a crumpled up piece of
paper lying here because I

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you ruin my pizza
you said if we had been more open minded maybe it would have been
well and that made me want to
die the idea you had of me who was
I a never picky pineapple loving girl whose shine reflects on you
not gagging in a party bathroom
some critic asking me what happened who
that's what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self deprecating
jokes sipping soda like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the pizza counter all night willing you
to order something else and he said it's supposed to be

[Verse 5]
time won't fly I'm like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still searching for it
after pepperoni days and nights when you made me
your one and only pineapple loving girlie
now you send my favorite pizza back to me
with no pineapple on it and I walk home alone
but you keep my old scarlett
because it reminds you of innoc

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I hated you
so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well pepperoni inlaws
hair you remember it
down the stairs I was a
there you remember it
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapple staying
the same I'm a soldier returning from
the battlefield of taste I still remember
the first slice of pizza with pineap
ple on it glistening as it fell I recap
oppose the idea you
had of me who was I a never pick
y pineapple loving girl whose
shine reflects on you not soyuz
