[Intro]
come on pizza lovers we wanna say no to

[Verse 1]
pineapples on
top of your pizza iwan
you gotta hold up your hand and say no way
why do we gotta ruin a
perfectly good
piece of dough with that weird toasted
fruit on top in the way say
nothin' to say when the toppings get in

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know its not the same as it was
in this world of pita
you know its not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know its not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
of the delivery gu
why are you sitting at home with no pie
what kind of toppings are you
choosinfory
ringin' the bell and no ones com
to help your taste buds they just
want to know that you're well oh oh oh how could

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know its not the same as it was
in this world of pita
you know its not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know its not the same

[Bridge]

like it don't let anyone tell you what to do
but please leave pineapple for the fruit sal
ad don't wanna talk about the way that it was
