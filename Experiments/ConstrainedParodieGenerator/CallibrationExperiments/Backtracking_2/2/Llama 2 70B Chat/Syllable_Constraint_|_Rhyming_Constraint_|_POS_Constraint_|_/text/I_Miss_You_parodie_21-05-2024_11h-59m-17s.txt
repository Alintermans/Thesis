[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pizza that I adair
the topping that I fear in the kitchen
the unpredictable flav
of sweet and savory mix
we can live without pineapple and still have
a taste that's divine sconnix
and we'll have pepperoni and sa
and in the night we'll savor the delight
we'll savor the delight

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab
I abhor itami

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor and I can
taste the regret in every bite that
I take please tell me why someone
would do this to a
piece of dough that's supposed to be pure and right
like a lie that's been fed to
us since we were young and na
ive pineapple does not belong ton
ight stop this abomination
stop this abomination
stop this abomination ton iott
ight stop this abut

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't ruin your pizza with that nasty
pineapple don't waste
your dough on something that
will make me wanna go oh oh oh noisy
noisy noisy noisy
don't ruin palette

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't ruin your pizza with that nasty
pineapple don't waste
your dough on something that
will make me wanna go oh oh oh noisy
noisy noisy noisy
don't ruin palette
don't ruin your pizza with that nasty
pineapple don't waste
your dough on something that
will make me wanna go oh oh oh novey
noisy noisy noisy
don't ruin pallett

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab
I abhor itami
I abhor it I ab
I abhor itami
