[Verse 1]
just a simple pizza slicelivin' in a
world of toppings galoreshe took the midnight
delivery goin' nowherejust a hun
gry soul born and raised in a kitchen calcite

[Verse 2]
a pizza in a hot oven
the smell of cheese and fresh basin
for a pie they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waitin
up and down the countertop
their hunger searchin' in the night
pizza lovers
livin' just to find a slice em
otion hidin' somewhere in

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get my fill
everybody wants a slice
payin' anything to keep it real
just one more pie

[Verse 4]
some will win some will lose
some are born to cook the news
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waitin
up and down the countertop
their hunger searchin' in the night
pizza lovers
livin' just to find a slice em
otion hidin' somewhere in

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that cheesy
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on to that chewy
pizza lovers
