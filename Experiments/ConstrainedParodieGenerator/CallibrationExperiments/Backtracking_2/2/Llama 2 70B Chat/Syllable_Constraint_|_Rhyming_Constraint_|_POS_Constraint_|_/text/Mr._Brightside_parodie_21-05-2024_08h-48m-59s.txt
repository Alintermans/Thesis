[Verse]
comin' out of my kitchen and I've been cookin' just
gotta gotta be hot because I want it all
it started out with a pineapple how did it end up
like this it was only a pineapple it was
only a pineapple now I'm fallin' asleep
and she's callin' a doctor while he's havin' a
stroke and she's takin' a nap now they're goin' to
bed and my stomach is

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's touchin' my tongue now
he takes off my fernau
let me go
'cause I just can't eat it it's killin' me
and cuttin' my thro

[Chorus]
pineapple turnin' pizza into the
dumpster swimmin' through melted
cheese chokin' on your alfred
but it's just the price I pay
destination isaiah
open up my eager bel
'cause I'm mr pizza

[Guitar Solo]
