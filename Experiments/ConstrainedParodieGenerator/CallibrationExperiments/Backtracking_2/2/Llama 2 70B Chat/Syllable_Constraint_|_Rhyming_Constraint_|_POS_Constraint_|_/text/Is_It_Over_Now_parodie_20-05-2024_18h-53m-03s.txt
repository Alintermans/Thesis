[Intro]
can we talk about pineapple on a

[Verse 1]
pizza crust so fine and so
for the cheese to adhere isgro
but then comes the pineo
its juice makes the whole

[Pre-Chorus]
thing a soggy mess and such a bummer let's fast forward
to a world where pineapple's a no go zone I see profiles
of pizza perfection without a single pineapple in
sight you dream of flavors that don't make me wanna vomit but

[Chorus]
was it over when the pineapple first touched
the pie was it over when my taste buds cried
come here I whispered in your ear
in my dream as you cut the pizza
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it is it is it

[Verse 2]
when the toppings hit the o
ven red sauce white cheese oh
blue box from the fricano
your new pizza's a clone

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the pineapple on
your pizza there were flashing lights
at least I had the decen
cy to keep my complaints out of sight
only rumors bout
the deliciousness of a ha
waiian pizza and my whisper
ed sighs oh lord I think ab
out leaving pizza for good just to avoid

[Pre-Chorus]
seeing pineapple on top of a beautiful pie let's fast
forward to three hundred arguments later oh and by the way lambaste
me all you want but pineapple does not belong on a pizza
you dream of flavors that make my stomach turn and my tastebud

[Chorus]
buds shudder was it over when the pineap
ple first touched the pie was It over when I
begged you to take it off come here
I whispered in your ear in my dream
as you passed out baby was it over then

[Post-Chorus]
and is
it over now uh u
h u
is itochu

[Bridge]
oh lord I think about
leaving pizza for
good just to avoid seeing pin
eapple on top of a pie that
should be perfect only rumors bout
the deliciousness
of a hawaiian pizza and
my whispered sighs oh lord I
think about jumping off of very
tall pizza expectations just to see you

[Outro]
come running with a pie
that's perfect and pineapple free and say the one thing iwai
ian pizza lovers don't want to
hear but no flashin lights oh
lord oh pizza perot
