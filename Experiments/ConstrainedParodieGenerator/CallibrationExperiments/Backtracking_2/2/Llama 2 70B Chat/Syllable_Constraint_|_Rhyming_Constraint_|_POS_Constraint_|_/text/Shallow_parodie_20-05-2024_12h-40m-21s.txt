[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me somethin
is pineapple on pizza really
somethin' that you need
or is it just a phase you reced

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm callin
in all the good slices I find myself year
in' for
change and in the bad times I fear this

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me somethin
is pineapple on pizza what you re
ally crave or is
it just a trend that needs to beverages

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in all the good times I find myself longing
for change
and in the bad times I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never touch the ground
crash through the surface where the toppings can't
hurt us we're far from the shall

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow in
the sha ha la la la low nayden
on the pizza we standin
we're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never touch the ground
crash through the surface where the toppings can't
hurt us we're far from the shall

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow
in the sha ha la la lazaro
on the pizza we stand
we're far from the shallow now
