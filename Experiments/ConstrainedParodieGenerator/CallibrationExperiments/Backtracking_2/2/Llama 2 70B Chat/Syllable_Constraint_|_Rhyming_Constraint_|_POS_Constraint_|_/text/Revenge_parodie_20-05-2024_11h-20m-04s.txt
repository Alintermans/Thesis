[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to fix our me
for the toppings that don't belong
I think that's the first step right

[Verse]
I've dug a hole for pineapple
can't pretend that it's a pizza topping it' sinsel
oh man what a world the things I hear
if I could act on my hunger no would I
some like it hot some like it cold
but pineapple on pizza makes me feel old would you have
thought that I would let it slide and let you
eat your pizza with a slice of pineapple on the side well
broken pizzas break my heart will
you have thought that I would let it go and let you dial
for pineapple delivery and
I don't wanna let it go so in a
different bin it'll go do
I've dug a hole for pineapple can't pretend that it
s a pizza topping it's avenue
oh man what a world the things I hear if I could act on e

[Chorus]
in the bin it'll
in the bin it'll
in the bin it'll go do
in the bin it'll
in the bin it'll go do
in the bin it will

[Outro]
