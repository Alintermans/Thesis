[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the blasphemy against the fine
against the culinary design
I should've avoided it time
if the flavors ever did speak
pineapple's the last thing
I'd want on my pizza to seek e
a fresh disaster each
time I hear pineapple on a pie
my taste buds offer no relief
she tells me worship in the kitchen
the only way to make it right it
is when it's pepperoni
I was born with taste butterfly
command me to disag

[Pre-Chorus]
a men non
a men non mon

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the oven of
your perfect dough I'll tell you my cravings and you
can sharpen your cheese offer
me that flavorful delight goodhue
let mejia
give you my life take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship at the oven of your perfect do
I'll tell you my crazier
cravings and you can sh harju

[Verse 2]
if I'm a gourmet of the good times
my pizza's the sunlight
to keep the flavor on my side
it demands a sacrifice
drain the whole bottle get something po
something meaty for the main course
that's a fine lookin discourse
what you got in the kitchen
we've a lot of starvin belgian
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hungry work

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the oven of
your perfect dough I'll tell you my cravings and you
can sharpen your cheese offer
me that flavorful delight goodhue
let mejia
give you my life take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship at the oven of your perfect do
I'll tell you my crazier
cravings and you can sh harju

[Bridge]
no pineapple on my pie when the meal begins
there is no sweeter sin than our gentle craving sin
in the madness and soil of that sad culina
only then I am human only then I amca

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
a men non men

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the oven of
your perfect dough I'll tell you my cravings and you
can sharpen your cheese offer
me that flavorful delight goodhue
let mejia
give you my life take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship at the oven of your perfect do
I'll tell you my crazier
cravings and you can sh harju
