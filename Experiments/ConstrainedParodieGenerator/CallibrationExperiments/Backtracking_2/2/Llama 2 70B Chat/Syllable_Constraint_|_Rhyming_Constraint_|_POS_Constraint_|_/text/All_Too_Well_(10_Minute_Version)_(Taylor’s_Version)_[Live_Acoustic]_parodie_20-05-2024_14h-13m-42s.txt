[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong it was
like a crime scene without a care and nowhere

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory crave sangria
we ordered a pie getting lost in flavor
pepperoni and sausage falling down like rain
and I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that taste is not here no more
and I might be okay but my taste buds are not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost dropped the slice because you were looking at me with
pepperoni in my hair
I was there I remember it

[Verse 3]
photo of pineapple on the menu counter taking
up space like it was a crime your taste buds were abused in aven
and your stomach's telling stories bout you on a diet plan
you told me bout your cravings thinking your future was
pineapple on pizza and you were tossing me the utah
slice like we were always skipping town and I was
thinking on the drive down any time now he's gonna
say it's gross you never called it what it was until we
were dead and gone and buried and
checked the taste and come back swearing it's the same
after three slices in the
grave and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for
you but all I felt was shame and you held my nanda

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept pineapple on pizza like a secret but
I kept you like anna
sacred prayer and we'd swear to forget

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paper here
cause I remember it all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my taste
you said if we had been closer in flavor maybe it would have been
fine and that made me want to
die the idea you had of me who was
she a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
not pepperoni in a party
bathroom some pizza asking me what e
ventually happened
you that's what happened you you who charmed my taste
buds with self effacing toppings sipping coffee
like you're on a late night show but then he watched me watch the front door
all night willing you to come and he said it's supposed to

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my toppings and I walk homeg
alone but you keep my old slice from that very
first week cause it reminds you of innocence and it
smells like me you can't get
rid of it cause you remember it

[Chorus]
cause there we are again when I loved you
so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well wind in my hair you was
there you remember it
all down the stairs you was
there you remember it
all it was rare I was
there I remember itochu

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapples staymy
age from when your hawaiian broke my taste
and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half
my weight and did the twin flame bruise paint
you blue just between us did the love affair ma
im you too cause in this flav
or's barren cold I still remember the
first slice of pepperoni and
how it glistened as it felland

[Outro]
I remember it all too well just between us do you
remember it all too well just between us I too
well wind in my hair I was there I was there down the stairs soohoo
rare you remember it all too well wind
in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there pardue
rare you remember it all too well wind
in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was
there it was rare you remember it mind
wind in my hair I was there I was
there down the stairs I was there I was
there sacred prayer I was there was
there it was rare you remember it kind
wind in my hair I was there I was
there down the stairs I was there I was
there sacred prayer I was there I wasiyu

[Spoken Outro]
