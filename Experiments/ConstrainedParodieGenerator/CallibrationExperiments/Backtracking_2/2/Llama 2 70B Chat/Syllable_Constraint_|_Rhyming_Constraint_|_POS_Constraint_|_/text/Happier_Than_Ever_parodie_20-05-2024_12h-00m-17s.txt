give me a slice or two to think of something newto
to write myself aiello
to tell me what to do bo
do you read my interviews
or do you skip my avenue
when you said you were passing through
was I even on your way
I knew when I asked you to how I wasiyu
be cool about what I was telling you
you'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do who you aid hebrew
and I'd end up more afraid
don't say it isn't fair

[Verse 2]
you call me again driving your ben
driving home under the influence
you scared me to death but I'm wasting my breath
cause you only listen to your frenchmen
I don't relativate
I don't relativate to
cause I'd never treat me this ship
you made me hate this cowslip

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
cause that shit's embarrassing you were my ego
and all that you did was make me f kjenstad
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line because you never did
never paid any mind to my mother or friends so I
shut em all out for you cause I was aided

[Outro]

always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just f kjenstad leave me alone yeah yeah
