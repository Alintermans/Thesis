[Verse 1]
just stop your whining it's a crime against the
pizza we all know is a
crime to put pineapple up on
it doesn't belong there it's a sin down with the
pineapple pizza haters
and the pineapple pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we keep making the
same mistake over and over again
pineapple on pizza
we never learn we keep making the
same mistake over and over again

[Chorus]
