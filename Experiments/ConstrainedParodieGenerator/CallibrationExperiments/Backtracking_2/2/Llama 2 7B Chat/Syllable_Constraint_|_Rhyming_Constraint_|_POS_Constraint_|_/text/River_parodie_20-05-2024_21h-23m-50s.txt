the sausage and pepperoni on his maligned
he's got a thing for the tropical treat elkind
and he can't get enough of that sweet
but she just wants to exact revenge and get back at him
for putting pineapple on his pizza in the first place it's a game
of cat and mouse and pineapp

to the time before he made that fateful decision to
