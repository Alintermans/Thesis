[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
defies the laws of nature and reason too
it's like putting ketchup
on a hot dog that's been cooked and served to
it just doesn't make sense to me and you no matter
the world was made up of

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I protest sometimes when I'm lying in
just to get it all out what's in myojin
and I i am feeling a little picky oh
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I realize that
pineapple has no place on a pie
na na na na

[Chorus]
and I say ain't it
ain trivett
I said ain't it funny how
pineapple on a fit
ain trivett
I said ain't it funny how

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I try to
oh my goodness dopa
I try every
single day to avoid
the sweet and
sour taste of disband
I pray every single day
for a world without

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I i am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I realize that
pineapple has no place on a pie
na na na na

[Chorus]

twenty five years and my life
still trying to get up that great big hill of
hope for a destination
