[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
how could you even consider such a thing
it's like putting ketchup on a hot dog in
disgusting and wrong in every kindling

[Verse 2]
the toppings should be evenly spaced and of a harm
you can't just throw a random fruit on there
it's like a pizza without cheese in italy
and we all know how they feel about gendar

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that taste is not here no more
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
because there we are again on that pizza
you've got the pepperoni but where's the mushrooma nd on
I remember it all too
you used to be a little slice

[Verse 3]
photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little pizza with pepperoni in a cal
and your mother's telling stories about you on the pepper
you told me about your past thinking your future was
and you were tossing me the pepperoni with aromas
and I was thinking on the drive down any time
you're gonna say it's pineapple and I'm gonna say
it's a crime against humanity and the pizza too
key chain on the ground we were al
running scared I was there I remember it
all too well and there we are
again when nobody had to know and you kept me like
a secret but I kept you like a oath sacred prayer

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
because there we are again on that pizza with
you've got the pepperoni but where's the mushrooma nesseth
I remember it all
you used to be a little slice
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
promise sacred prayer and
we'd swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
or maybe this thing was a
masterpiece until you tore it all up
running scared I was
there I remember it
all too well and you call me up
again just to break me like a promise so casually
cruel in the name of being honest I'm a crumpled up
piece of paper lying here because I remem
ber it all all too well yeah yeah

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you you
not weeping in a party bathroom
some actress asking me what happened you
that's what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self effacing jo
sipping coffee like you're on a late night showbut
then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come and
he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty oneam

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
because it reminds you of innocence and it sets
you can't get rid of it
because you remember it all too

[Chorus]
because there we are again on that am
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime you've got
the pepperoni but
where's the mushroom and on again
I remember it allnutt
you used to be a lit
tle slice of pawtuxet
and there we are again
when nobody hadnot
to know and you kept me like a

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your lovers stay my age
from when your buffalo broke my skin and
I'm a soldier who's returning half my weight
and did the tragic flame bruise paint you
blue just between us did the love affair mahe
