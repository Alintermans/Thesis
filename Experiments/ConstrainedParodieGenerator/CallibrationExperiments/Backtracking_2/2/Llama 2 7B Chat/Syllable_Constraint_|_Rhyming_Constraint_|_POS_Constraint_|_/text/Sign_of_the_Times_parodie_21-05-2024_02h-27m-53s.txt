[Verse 1]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pie
it's a topping that just doesn
don't belong in the sky high
it's a flavor that don't mix with the cheese and
the sauce and the pepperon
it's a crime against human

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learned what goes on a pie
why do we always put it to the test
the toppings that we choose
we never learn our p isty
we never learn our p isty mess
the pineapple andrew

[Chorus]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pie
it's a topping that just don't
don't belong in the cheekbone
it's a flavor that don't mix with the
sauce and the pepperoni and
it's a crime against human o

[Verse 2]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pie
it's a topping that just don
don't belong in the che

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learned what goes on a pie
why do we always put it to the test
the toppings that we choose
we never learn our p isty
we never learn our p isty mess
the pineapple andrew

[Chorus]

the pineapple andrew

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
we should open up
before it's all too much
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pie if
you want to see me smile
it's a topping that just don't go with the che
sauce and the pepperoni and the pie dial
it's a crime against human I
we got to get away awhile
we got to get away awhile
