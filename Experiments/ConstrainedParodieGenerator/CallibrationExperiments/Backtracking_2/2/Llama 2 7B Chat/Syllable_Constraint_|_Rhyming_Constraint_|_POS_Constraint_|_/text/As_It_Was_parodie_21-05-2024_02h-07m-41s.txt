[Intro]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pie to

[Verse 1]
sweet and tangy
flavors clashing inwardly
it doesn't belong on my pie to fly high
why must you try to deny me
innocence lost
when toppings collide in defrost
pineapple doesn't reson
and I'm the king of the pizza line to

[Chorus]
in this pizza world it
you know it's not the same as it
in this pizza world it
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
spicy sausage
rules the pizza game forage
mushrooms bring the funky flavor to the
meat lovers reign supreme in
tomato sau
but pineapple is a crime to
my taste buds in their prime to
it doesn't belong on my pizza pie to

[Chorus]
in this pizza world it
you know it's not the same as it
in this pizza world it
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
classic pepperoni slices so fine
it stretches back in time to when the pizza was mine
chewy mozzarella cheese brings delight
its flavors blend just right to ignite my night to be

[Outro]
don
pineapple
you know it's not the same asiel
in this pizza world it
