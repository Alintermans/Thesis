[Intro]
is it a crime being served on a plate

[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
oh no don't make meola
it clashes with theora
you know I can't

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza parties later
I can't believe you'd even consider it borrower
you dream of my crust before it called you a lying traitor
you search in every topping's bed for somethin' greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when he added pineapple
was it over when he added cheese oh no
I whispered in your ear come here
in your dream as you bit into it
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
uh huh is it really

[Verse 2]
pepperoni and sausage
red onion and sauvage
mushroom and olives asbridge
your new topping is what

[Bridge]
and did you think I wouldn't notice
there was pineapple
at least I had the decency
to keep my opinions out
only grumbles of discontent and
my raised egeland
oh lord I think about voting
off of very tall napkins
just to see you admit you
made a mistake and say the one thing I've been

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza parties later oh
I can't believe you'd even consider it borrower ohio
you dream of my cheese before it called you a lying traverso
you search in every pepperonI's bed for somethin' greater

[Chorus]
was it over when he added pineapple
was it over when he added cheese oh no
I whispered in your ear come here
in your dream as you bit into it
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
there was pineapple
at least I had the decency
to keep my opinions out
only grumbles of discontent and
my raised egeland
oh lord I think about voting
off of very tall napkins
just to see you admit you made a
mistake and say the one thing I've been wanting
