[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I tried to put pineapp
on a pizza once beforehand
but now I see it's just a sinful
disaster waiting atmel

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
it doesn't belong on
a pie with cheese and pepperoni
how could anyone think it
ever made sense to combine them howlett
one look at the toppings bar
and I knew it was ajar
and I wouldn't be the king forever
because pineapple doesn't belong adler

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells ringing loud and
pizza loyalists singing out loud
remove it from the menu and
I'll be the first in line to shout hougland
never an honest word was spoken
when I ruled the pizza world
now I know saint peter
won't call my name forever

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it's a tropical twist too far
I can't even imagine
getting pepperoni and mushrooms
together in perfect harmony is
something straight from the heavens
but pineapple is aversions
so I'll stick to the classic combinations
root for the underdog and never

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells ringing loud and
pizza loyalists singing out loud
remove it from the menu and
I'll be the first in line to shout hougland
never an honest word was spoken
when I ruled the pizza worldande now I
know saint peter won't
call my name forevermoreore
