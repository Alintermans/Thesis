[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the toppings on my pierre
the juicy sweetness that's not mine to share
we can't live without che
the flavor that's just beyond
we'll have pineapple on pizza every
and in the night we dumond
we'll wish this pineapple never ends
we'll wish this pineapple never ends no
no no no noverco

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where are the peppers and sausage
I cannot eat this pizza without them
I need a topping and always
this spicy heat that
comes creeping on so haunting every time
and as I stare I counted
the seconds until the to
will come home and stop this hunger ton
stop this hunger tonight no no
no no no novercoino
will come home and stop this hunger sonum
stop this hunger ton

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the toppings on our
I miss pineapple on
don't waste your time on pineapple you got
the toppings onlooker
I miss pineapple on

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the toppings on our
I miss pineapple on
don't waste your time on pineapple you got
the toppings onlooker
I miss pineapple on
don't waste your time on pineapple you bought
the toppings insofar
I miss pineapple on
don't waste your time on pineapple you ro
the toppings insecure
I miss pineapple on

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
