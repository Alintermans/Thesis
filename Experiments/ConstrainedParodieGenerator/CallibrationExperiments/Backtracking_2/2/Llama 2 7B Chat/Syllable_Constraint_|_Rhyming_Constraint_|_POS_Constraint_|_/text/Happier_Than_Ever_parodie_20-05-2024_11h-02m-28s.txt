[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
ain't no reason why it
I'm happier than everitt
I wish I could explain

[Verse 1]
give me a slice of cheese to think of something clever
to write myself aulander
to tell me what to do is
do you mix it with ham or
or do you keep it simple with
when you put it on aerosmith
I knew it was trouble from
the moment I saw it on the menu borseth
I wished I could explain it better with
I wish it wasn't true that it doesn't belong on a pizza with
oregano and basil
you clearly weren't aware
that pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza with
so if you really want to know

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie ain't no reasonwhy
I'm happier than ever with a cheeseburger in
I wish I could explain it better with a side of finkielstain
I wish it wasn't true that

[Verse 2]
you call me again with a craving
for something sweet and spicy savage
you know I can't resist your tropical
flavors and aromas of paradise
I don't related to
I don't relate to you no
cause pineapple doesn't belong
on a pizza with oolong

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you in a rap battle
never told anyone anything bad
cause pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza
and that's not a phase it's a factual sad
you made me hate this pizza topping with
a passion that's unnatural had
to make me feel like I'm in a bad romantic comedy
so don't waste the time I don't have with a to
and don't try to make me feel bad about my pizza
I could talk about every topeka

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
with your tropical twist of pepcid
made all my moments your own
with your sweet and spicy flavorsomeone
