[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza cannot be rightly so
gotta get it off before I lose my mind you
it started out with a toppingchoice how did it end up
it was only a sprinkle but now it allsup
now I'm gaggin' on a meal and my tastebud
while they're savorin' the sweetness and my stomach
now they're goin' back for more and my mouth is a
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's sittin' on top of
he takes a b o'g
let me go
'cause I just can't swallow it is killin
and taking control

[Chorus]
pineapple jealousy turnin' pizza
swimmin' through cheese lullabies
choakin' on my anger is
but it's just the price I pay
destination isaiah
open up my hungry eyes
'cause I'm anti brightside

[Guitar Solo]
