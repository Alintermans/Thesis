[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottle in hand looking for that slice oh
it started out as a joke how did it end up like this
pineapple on a pizza ain't no luscious
now I'm staring at this monstrosity in shock
while my taste buds cry out for something proper to
masticate on instead of this desecrated
dish it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're devouring it
it fills me with disgust
take it back
and I just can't bear it seeing this
abomination

[Chorus]
jealousy of those who can enjoy it
savory flavors drowning
hammers of disappointment
but it's just the price I pay
sanity is calling quit
slamming shut my willing lips
cause I'm mr den

[Guitar Solo]
