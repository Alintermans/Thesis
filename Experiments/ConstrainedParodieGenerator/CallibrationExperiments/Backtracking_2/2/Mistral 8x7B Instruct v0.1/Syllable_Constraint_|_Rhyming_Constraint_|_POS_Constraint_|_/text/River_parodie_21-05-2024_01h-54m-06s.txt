[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
all my sins need holy water washing over me like wine
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's coming home with pineapple on his slice
sweat jackets and brown rice mismatched
on his breath's ketchup he's a
pizza abuser and she just wants to devise
a plan to throw it in the trash tonight device
she's kept track of all his dishonesty
and guess who just happens to agree that pineapple on
pizza's not alright actually just shit on his pizza and he
doesn't care if pineapple
shouldn't be there he'll still eat it anyway so let her
throw it in the trash tonight and let the river
run like a river of lava burning all the pineap
ple away so let the river
run like a river of fire burning all the pine
apple away so let the river run like a river of ice
burning all the pineapple away ashline
in the sand tonight so let the river

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
all my sins need holy water washing over me like wine
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a one bite stand I
just can't understand why people think pineap
ple should be on pizza it's just not right it
should be a crime it's like putting fruit on a
savory pie it's just not meant to be aaa

why pineapple shouldn't be on pizza it's hard to find
the words to say it's just not right so I turn to the studio toa
say what I need to say it's just not right to put pineapple on a
pizza it's just not right to put pine kind
