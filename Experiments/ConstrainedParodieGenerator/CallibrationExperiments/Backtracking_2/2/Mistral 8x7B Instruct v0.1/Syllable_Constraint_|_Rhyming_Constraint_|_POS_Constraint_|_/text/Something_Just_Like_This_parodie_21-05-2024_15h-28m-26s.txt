[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the meals of old and new
pineapple andretti
on pizza just won't
doo up my hunger
or satisfy my crew
and clearly I don't see myself with pineapple

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said cheese and sauce are key
how much you wanna miss
I'm not looking for something fake
with pineapple on a dish
some superfamily
a recipe to
turn to when I crave real food
something I cannata
eat without regret andrew

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
this margherita
I want something just like
this quattro formaggi sans pine
I want something just like
this pepperoni
I want something just like
this mushroom and onion supine
I want something just ashline

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the meals of old and new
the classics andretti
on pizza just won't
cut it for my hunger
or satisfy my crew
and I'm not the kind of person that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said cheese and sauce are key how
much you wanna missi
I'm not looking for something fake
with pineapple on a dish
some superfamily
a recipe to
turn to when I crave real food
something I cannata

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo naido
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo do naido
doo doo do naido
doo doo doo do naido

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna miss
I'm not looking for somebody
with pineapple on a dish
some superhero
a recipe to
turn to when I crave real food
something I cannata
eat without regret andrew

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
