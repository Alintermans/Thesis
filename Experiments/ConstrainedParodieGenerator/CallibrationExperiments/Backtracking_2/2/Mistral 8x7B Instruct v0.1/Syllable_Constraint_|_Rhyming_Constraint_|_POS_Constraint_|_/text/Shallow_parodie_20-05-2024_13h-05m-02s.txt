[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something' bout
that slice of pizza with pineapple
on top or not izz
it still a tasty dish tompkinses

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm appalled
at the thought of pineapple on a pizza
for real
it's a crime against our taste bud

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something man
is that really the best you can can can
on your pizza plate
shouldn't there be something better upstate

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm appalled
at the thought of pineapple on a pizza
for shame
it's a culinary disaster

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end cutting that fruit off
my slice forever changed
pizza purity restored once again we
have banished the pineapple

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the no way pineapple
in the oh hell no pizza townsel
in the never pineal
we've banished the pineapple

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh no oh no
oh hello

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end cutting that fruit off
my slice forever changed
pizza purity restored once again we
have banished the pineapple

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the no way pizza
in the hell no vegetable toga
in the never aga
we've banished the pineapple
