[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a culinary crime
don't you think it's gross inside
you can't cover up the taste with extra cheese
it's just wrong on a pizza
it's a crime against the bread

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
get served at the table
we've been here before trying tofu
or mushrooms instead of pineapple we
never seem to beagle

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
put down that pineapple slice and hear me
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a culinary sin
don't you think it's gross on
a pizza with pepperoni or sa
we can find a better pair
somewhere far away from pine

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
get served at the table
we've been here before trying tofu
or mushrooms instead of pineapple we
never seem to beagle

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
stop your crying baby it'll be alright
we won't serve you pineapple
we gotta get away from this

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
get served at the table
we've been here before trying tofu
or mushrooms instead of pineapple we
never seem to beagle

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
about the right to
ppings on our pizza
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my pleax no
we got to get away
we got to get away we got to getaway
we got to get away we got to getaway
we got to we got to runway
we got to we got to flyway
we got to we got to fremiet
