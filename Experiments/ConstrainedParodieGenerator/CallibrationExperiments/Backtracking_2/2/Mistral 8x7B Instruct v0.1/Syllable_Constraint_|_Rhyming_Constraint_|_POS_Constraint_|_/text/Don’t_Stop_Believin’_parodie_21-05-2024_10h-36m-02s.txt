[Verse 1]
just a small town slicefar from a pineapple
a classic pie with cheese and pepperoni
there's no room for fruit on a savory dishlike
it's a sin to put pineapple onishi

[Verse 2]
a slice in hand at the local
the taste of dough and tangible
for a bite they gladly partake
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
lining up the avenue
their mouths yearning in delightful
cheesy goodness
livin' just to bite emotion
hidden in the pizza a

[Verse 3]
baking hard to get it right
everyone craving allright
fork and knife to take a slice upright
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will savor some will
some are born to hate this'll
ruin pizzas everywhere
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
lining up the avenue
their mouths yearning in delightful
cheesy goodness
livin' just to bite emotion
hidden in the pizza a

[Guitar Solo]
