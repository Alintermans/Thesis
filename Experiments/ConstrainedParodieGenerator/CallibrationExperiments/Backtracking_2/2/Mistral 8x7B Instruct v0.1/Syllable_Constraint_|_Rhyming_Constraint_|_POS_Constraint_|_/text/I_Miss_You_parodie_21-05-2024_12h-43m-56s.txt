[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise It, I

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
that abomination at
the dinner table on a pizza base
a monstrosity lurking
in the shadows of the fe
we can dine in disgust if we want it served
where you can always find me
and our taste buds will shiver in
disgust as we partake in this sinful
act that we'll regretful

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the ham and pineapple
belongs in a trash can tonight alone
I need something savory and
always pineapple
creeps in like a monster every time ru
and as I stare I counted
the bits of pineapple left
disgusting texture and flavorless
meat that should not be here tonight
stop this pain tonight with a
ham and cheese delight instead tonight tone
remove this disown

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't serve me pineapple on a pizza
it's the voice inside me
I despise it I desp
remove that pineapple I despise ita
the voice inside mehdi
I despise it I desp

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't serve me pineapple on a pizza
it's the voice inside me
I despise it I desp
remove that pineapple I despise ita
the voice inside mehdi
I despise it I desp
don't serve me pineapple on aida
the voice inside myrlie
I despise it I desp
don't serve me pineapple on aqaba
the voice inside meckley
I despise it I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
