[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go ical error
pineapple should not be thereafter
I should've added pepperron
if the tastebuds ever did
speak they'd share my terror
each slice now brings me closer tasted
once but never again
we were doomed from the first bite taken
my pizza gives no consoling
the only joy I'll find nowadays
is in a slice without pineapple
I was deceived but howell
command me to protestation
acceptable toppings

[Pre-Chorus]
a comma
comma comma

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza's shrine it's blasphemy to allow
it ruins every flavor you could endow
offer me that savory
oh great pizza god let me chertkow
keep pineal
off my pizza's shrine it's blasphemy to allow
it ruins every flavor you could endow
offer me that savagely
oh great pizza god let me sorkow

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the good slic
et pineapple should not
grace it with its presence ever
demanding sacrifice of
flavor and tradition discernable
something cheesy worthy of the
main course no such luckily
what you got in the oven
we've a lot of pizza purdon
some fake fans like pineapple u
nderstandably this

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza's shrine it's blasphemy to allow
it ruins every flavor you could endow
offer me that savory
oh great pizza god let me chertkow
keep pineal
off my pizza's shrine it's blasphemy to allow
it ruins every flavor you could endow
offer me that savagely
oh great pizza god let me sorkow

[Bridge]
no compromises when opinions clash anon
the truth remains that pineapple on pizza's wrong and gone
in the bitterness of pineapple on a slice
only then I regret agreeing to this device

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza's shrine it's blasphemy to allow
it ruins every flavor you could endow
offer me that savory
oh great pizza god let me chertkow
keep pineal
off my pizza's shrine it's blasphemy to allow
it ruins every flavor you could endow
offer me that savagely
oh great pizza god let me sorkow
