[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
my taste buds scream in horror
wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't so

[Verse 1]
let me take a minute to consider this monster
this creation oftener
should I even try to che
would you eat it on your own
or leave it all alone at home
when you brought it to the table
was it even worth the while
I knew when I took a bite firstly I cydrome
you'd ruin my beloved pizza style to
it shouldn't be combined with cheese and tomato oh no woah syndrome
and I'd end up with bad taste
don't say it's just a phase
you clearly weren't aware that you polluted it
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza pie I'm eatin
I'm angrier than ever wish I could explain it
I wish it wasn't true mmhmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmm
I wish it wasn't soohoh

[Verse 2]
you text me again asking for a
goddamn slice of pineapple pizza
you disgust me to death but I'll spare my breath
'cause you only listen to your ignorant
I don't understand you
I don't understand you no
'cause I'd never sully my pizza
you bastardized ita

[Verse 3]
and I don't praise pineapple on my pizza online
never told anyone anything nice
'cause that shit's embarrassing you desecrated it
should've stuck to plain cheese and simple advice
so don't waste my time I haven't got
and don't force me to eat todi
I could tell you every time that you ate it with delight
but I'd have an empty mind because it never was
never thought it right to mix sweet and savory oh no
fruit and pizza don't belong together

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
pineapple is misunderstood you
made all my moments your own
just leave me and my pizza alone yeah
ah
goddam
ah
goddam
ah
