[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pizza topped with pineapple
but you don't really care for it do ya shelf
it goes like this the pineapple
the taste so strange it makes you craw
as you take a bite of this pizza scandal

[Chorus]
pineapple scandal oh oh oh
pizza scandal oh ohio

[Verse 2]
your trust was strong but you needed proof
you tried it once and it foolproof
it left a bad taste and it cut your roof oh
it covered up the cheese so fine
it marred the taste of your pizza line
and left you with a pineapple pine oh oh

[Chorus]
pineapple scandal oh oh oh
pizza scandal oh ohio

[Verse 3]
you say it's fine I took it in
it doesn't really matter then
but if you did well really what's it to you
there's a twist of taste in every slice
it doesn't matter which advice
it's just a pineapple pizza scandal oh

[Chorus]
pineapple scandal oh oh oh
pizza scandal oh ohio

[Verse 4]
I tried my best it didn't last
I bit into it and it belfast
it left a bad taste and it made me hasty
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the pizza song
with nothing on my tongue but disaster oh

[Chorus]
pizza scandal oh oh ohoh
pizza scandal oh ohio
pizza scandal oh ohoh oh
pizza scandal oh ohio
pizza scandal oh ohoh oh
pizza scandal oh ohio
pizza scandal oh ohoh oh
pizza scandal oh ohio
pizza scandal oh ohoh ho

[Outro]
pizza scandal oh oh ohoh

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I walked this core
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pizza on the golden
archlove is not a victory
march it's a cold and it's a broken pizza oh

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what was really going onslow
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved into
you the pineapple wasiyu
and every bite we drew was pizza oh oh

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a taste above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdid you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken pizza oh oh
