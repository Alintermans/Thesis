He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nall my sins need holy water washing over me like wine\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's coming home with pineapple on his slice\nsweat jackets and brown rice mismatched\non his breath's ketchup he's a\npizza abuser and she just wants to devise\na plan to throw it in the trash tonight device\nshe's kept track of all his dishonesty\nand guess who just happens to agree that pineapple on\npizza's not alright actually just shit on his pizza and he\ndoesn't care if pineapple\nshouldn't be there he'll still eat it anyway so let her\nthrow it in the trash tonight and let the river\nrun like a river of lava burning all the pineap\nple away so let the river\nrun like a river of fire burning all the pine\napple away so let the river run like a river of ice\nburning all the pineapple away ashline\nin the sand tonight so let the river\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nall my sins need holy water washing over me like wine\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one night stand turned a one bite stand I\njust can't understand why people think pineap\nple should be on pizza it's just not right it\nshould be a crime it's like putting fruit on a\nsavory pie it's just not meant to be aaa\nnd now I'm stuck trying to explain to heryana\nwhy pineapple shouldn't be on pizza it's hard to find\nthe words to say it's just not right so I turn to the studio toa\nsay what I need to say it's just not right to put pineapple on a\npizza it's just not right to put pine kind\nof fruit on a pizza it's just not right to put pine\napple on a pizza it's just not right to put pineapple\non a pizza it's just not right toshiba\nrt pineapple on a pizza ita\njust not right to put pineapple on\na pizza it's just not right to put pineapple\non a pizza it's just not right to put\npineapple on a pi\nzza it's just not right to put pineapple o\nn a pizza it's just not right to put pineapple on a\npi\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's river my name\nsriver\nname\nriver run\ncall me river nanda\nme river we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the joker saying pineapple\nbelongs on pizza's fineline nowell\nfuck can I say if pizza was a highway and dishon\nesty was a dead end I'd be swerving in five lane\nsdeciding to never put pineapple\non pizza again because\nit's just not right it's just not right tompane\nllow pineapple on pizza it's just not right to\nallow pineapple on pizza it's just not\nright to put pineapple on pizza\nsorry to all the pineapple lovers but\nit's just not right to put pineapple on a\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nall my sins need holy water washing over me like wine\nwell little one\nI canine\n\n't take back what I said about pineapple\non pizza\n\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\n",
