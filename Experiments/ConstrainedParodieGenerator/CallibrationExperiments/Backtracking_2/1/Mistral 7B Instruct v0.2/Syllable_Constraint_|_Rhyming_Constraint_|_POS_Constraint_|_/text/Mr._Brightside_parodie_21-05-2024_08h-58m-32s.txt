[Verse]
comin' out of my kitchen and I've been doin' just
gotta hide in the corner because pineapple
started out on the piecrustbut ended up on the dish
it was only a topping it was only fish
now I'm watchin' them eat and my appetite's
gone while they're savourin' their slices and laughin
now they're goin' for seconds and my stomach is
heaving and it's all in

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's bite into his slice
he enjoys the misprice
let me go
'cause I just can't watch it kills me inside
and ruining the

[Chorus]
pineapple prideturning savoury
swimmin' through gross fruity sau
chokin' on your exc besaw
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callously
open up my closed middaugh
'cause I'm mr bewild

[Guitar Solo]
