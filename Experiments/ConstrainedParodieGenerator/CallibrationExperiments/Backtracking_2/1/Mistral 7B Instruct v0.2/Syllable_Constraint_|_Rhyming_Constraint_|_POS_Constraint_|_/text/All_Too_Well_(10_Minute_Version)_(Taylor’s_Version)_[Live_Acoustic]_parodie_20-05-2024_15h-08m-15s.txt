[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it wasn't right somehow
a slice of pineapple on your pizza pie
now ruins the taste for me every brow

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet disposition and my disgusted gaze
we argue in the car while heading away
leaves of pineapple falling down like pieces in
disarray I can picture it after days

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
pineapple on pizzas not
and I might pretend to be okay but I'm not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little pizza
you almost spoiled it all because of your obsession with pine
apple on top wind inmy
hair I remember it all too

[Verse 3]
pineapple album on the counter your cheeks were turning
red you used to be a pizza perfectionist in a twin sizing
bed and your mother's telling stories about your past pizza
creations you told me about your past pizza dreams
and you were tossing me the pepperoni keychain biremes
key chain on the ground we were always ordering
takeout and I was thinking on the drive down any
time now you're gonna regret that pineapple on your pie
'til we were dead and gone and buried
check the cheese and come back swearing it's the same
after three months in the grave
and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
but all I felt was disappointment and you defame

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the artificial light
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
ath sicilian prayer
to remember it all too well yeah

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this pizza was a master
piece til you topped it
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to blame me for your mistakes
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a ruined slice of pizza lying here here
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you experiment with
your pizza toppings I say leave well enough alone let it be plain
and that made me wanna die
the idea you had of me who was she
a neverneedy everlovely jewel whose flavor reflects on
you not me weeping in a party
kitchen some food critic asking amon
ewhat happened you
that's what happened you you who charmed my dad with
selfdeprecating jokes sipping beer like you're on
a late night show but then he watched me watch the delivery guy
all night long waiting for the pizza to arrive and he

[Verse 5]
time won't fly I'm like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to refit
after plaid shirt days and nights when you shared your pizza
now you send back my pepperoni andrada
but you keep my old pineapple from that very
first week it reminds you of memories and it tastes
like me you can't admit
'cause you remember it all too well yeah

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I wanted you
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
wind in my hair you beware
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at cooking jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pizza toppings stay
the same from when your pepperoni broke
my taste buds and bones I'm a pizza critic
who's returning half her appetite
and did the pineapple bruise paint you blue incite
hunger did the love affair
maim you too did the love affair maim you
too did the love affair maim me
'cause in this city's pizza jointly
