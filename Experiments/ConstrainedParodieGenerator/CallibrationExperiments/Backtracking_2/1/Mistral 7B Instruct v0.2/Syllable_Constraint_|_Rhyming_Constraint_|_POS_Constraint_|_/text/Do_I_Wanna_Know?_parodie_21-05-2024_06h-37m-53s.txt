[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever fear that it ruins pizza's harmony
it lingers on like something in your sne
are there some toppings that are more
should you have no idea that it's a
disaster waiting to unfold on your plate this e
how many food fights cancilla
'cause there's this pizzai found
that makes me shudder in disgust an' I avoid it on repe
until I lose my appetiteand spill my sauce

[Pre-Chorus]
has pineapple got a place on the pie's surface
was sorta hopin' it wouldn't invade our tur
fellow pizza lovers know that the nights were made
for relishing flavors that clash tomorrow incur

[Chorus]
scuttling backwards
ever thought of ordering
when you cruthirds
I always do
maybe I thirds
full of tradition
to stick with tomatoes birds
now I've thought it birds
scuttling backwards

[Verse 2]
have you got the courage
to admit that pineapple's not a sav
and if so I want to know what time savage
simmer down an' pucker up I'm sorry to interrupt
it's just I'm constantly on the brink of protesting and ref
but I don't know if you feel the same as brezhnev
but we could agree on a better topping chef

[Pre-Chorus]
has pineapple got a place on the pie's surface
was sorta hopin' it wouldn't invade our tur
fellow pizza lovers know that the nights were made
for relishing flavors that clash tomorrow incur

[Chorus]
scuttling backwards to the pepper and
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a few breland
I always do scuttling backhand
maybe I'm too longing for tradition
full of tradition scuttling
to fall for something newland
now I've thought it land
scuttlerback toland

[Outro]
has pineapple got a place on the pie's surface
was sorta hopin' it wouldn't invade our tur
fellow pizza lovers know that the nights were made
for relishing flavors that clash tomorrow incur
has pineapple got a place on my plate or not to
ever thought of ordering without the pineapple
has pineapple got a place on my plate or not to call
