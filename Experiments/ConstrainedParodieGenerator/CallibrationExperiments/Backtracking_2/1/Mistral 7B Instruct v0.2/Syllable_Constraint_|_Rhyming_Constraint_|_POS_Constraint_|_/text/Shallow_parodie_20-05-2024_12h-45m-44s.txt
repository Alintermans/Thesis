[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something's true
does a pineapple on pizza make
your taste buds renew
or do you crave something more tofu

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm disag
ing in all the good bites I find myself bug
ging for
change in the bad tastes I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something guy
are you tired of this pineapple pie
or do you need more
pizza toppings to keep up theodore

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in all the good slices I find myself ling
ering
for change and in the bad tastes I fear

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching this pineap
ple dive in no more ham
crash through the surface where they can't harm us
we're far from the peppery

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sausage rollin' in
the sausage sha la la la laffin
in the sausage roll linchpin
we're far from the peppery

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching this pineap
ple dive in no more ham
crash through the surface where they can't harm us
we're far from the peppery

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sausage shallow
in the sausage sha la lazaro
in the sausage shallow
we're far from the peppery
