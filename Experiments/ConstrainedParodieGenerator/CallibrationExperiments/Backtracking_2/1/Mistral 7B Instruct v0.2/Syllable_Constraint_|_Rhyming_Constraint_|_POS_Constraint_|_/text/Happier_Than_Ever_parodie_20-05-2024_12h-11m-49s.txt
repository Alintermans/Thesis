[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our culinary scene
I'm tastier than evergreen
wish I could make amon

[Verse 1]
give me a slice or two to ponder something clever
to create a reasoner
to eat myself a better
do you crave my recipes
or skip my pepperoni he
when you said you were passively
passionate about ham and
I knew when I offered you pineapple onni
you'd do the opposite of what washy
and I'd end up more annoyed by your choicey attitude gooseberry
so if you really wanna
be a gourmet crew believe
your palate won't deceive you who needs pineapple
when I'm away from pineapple

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now I'm tastier
happier than evergreen oh how delicious it
wish I could explain it better clearer than pineapple islet
I wish it wasn't true pie

[Verse 2]
you sneak it in undercover in
concealment so slyly hidden in
you scared me to death with a sinister grin
that ruins the flavor of myelin
I don't resonate with
I don't resonate with you
'cause I'd never contaminate me
this dish I love soothingly

[Verse 3]
and I don't disparage pineapple in the kitchen
never told anybody anything
'cause that's just disgraceful it was once my everything
and all that it did was make me crumbling
so don't squander the time I don't
have and don't try to tarnishing
I could eulogize every time you served it on time but
I'd have an empty line since you never did provide
never showed any sign of respect for my sage advice
so I shut off all other flavors for pied

[Outro]
you spoiled all my savory
thinking you were a culinary
made all my dishes your own
just pineapple away from me long gone
ah
goddam
ah
pierron
pierron
