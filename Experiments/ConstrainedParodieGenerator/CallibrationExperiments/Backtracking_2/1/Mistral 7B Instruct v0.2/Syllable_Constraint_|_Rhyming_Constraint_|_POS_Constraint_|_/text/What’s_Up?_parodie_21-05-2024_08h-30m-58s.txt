[Verse 1]
twenty years with this endless
struggle to remove that pineapple pester
from the savory dish
I tried to reason with those who insist
that this tropical fruit adds flavor to blissful dish
but what does it truly

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to vent my thoughts on this fruit inbred
and I weary of the endless debate so fee
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I shake my head
and I exclaim with all my mighty
what's happening

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyeyey heyhey
I said he
I said hey what's happening with
this pineapple onley
hey hayley
I said hey what's happening with

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
and I ple
oh my goodness save me
from this pineapple
and I prayed night and day
for a change
but it seems the longrange
plan is to keep it on delange
on delange foodway

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to fume about this fruit infrared
and I weary of the endless debate again
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I declare with all my mighty
what's happening

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyeyey heyhey
I said he
I said hey what's happening
with this pineapple ab

[Outro]
twenty years and my life is
trying to remove that pineapple presence
from the culinary sphere
