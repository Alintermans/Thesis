[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
he's the sneer at the barbequetable
pineapple on a pizza tangle
I should've said it before the
if the foodie gods ever spoke
they'd scornfully poke and
every slice feels like a provoke
a fresh contrad evoke
we were born tired of the tried and
my kitchen offers no divine
she insists I put pineapple on
the only gastronomic sin is
when I'm alone with thatches
I was born tired but I stand
get it off my pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
a protest
protest protest

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it up with pineapple at the alter
I'll list my reasons for this heinous act revealed
offer me that edible
oh good chef take my palate infield
take meh tomey
I'll add pineapple at the alter oftener
I'll recite my reasons for this blunder revealed
offer me that edival
oh good chef take my tastebud yield

[Verse 2]
if I'm a gourmet of the good times
my lover's the pineap
to keep this fusion on my side
she demands a sacrifice
replace the cheese with a tropical
pair it with ham for the perfect
that's a fine looking abject
what you got in the fridgey
we've a multitude ofc
this is culinary peril
this is savory

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it up with pineapple at the alter
I'll list my reasons for this heinous act revealed
offer me that edible
oh good chef take my palate infield
take meh tomey
I'll add pineapple at the alter oftener
I'll recite my reasons for this blunder revealed
offer me that edival
oh good chef take my tastebud yield

[Bridge]
no purists nor chefs when the recipe begins
there is no sweeter sensation than our radical
in the madness and kitchen of this radical
only then I am free only then I amoral

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh protest
protest protest

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it up with pineapple at the alter
I'll list my reasons for this heinous act revealed
offer me that edible
oh good chef take my palate infield
take meh tomey
I'll add pineapple at the alter oftener
I'll recite my reasons for this blunder revealed
offer me that edival
oh good chef take my tastebud yield
