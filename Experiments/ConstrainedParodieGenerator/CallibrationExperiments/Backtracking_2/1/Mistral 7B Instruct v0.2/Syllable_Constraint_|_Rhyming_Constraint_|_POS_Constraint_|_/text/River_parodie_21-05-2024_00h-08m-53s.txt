he brings it home sliced on his pizza plate to
jack daniels and tomato sauce
but she hates it with a passion so
it's a battle in the kitchen heated andrew
he insists it complements the flavor sheila
but she says it's an abomination
and uses her spatula as a weapon in hand with
determination to ban this intruder in the pantry and land
because she craves tradition
it's a test of wills a culinary warfare act two
she's kept track of all his orders online ata
grocery store app and guess who just happens to order
pineapple on his pizza pie

prove a point and she has what my ex lacked oh dear me oh dear me
cause she's a traditionalist andrea
