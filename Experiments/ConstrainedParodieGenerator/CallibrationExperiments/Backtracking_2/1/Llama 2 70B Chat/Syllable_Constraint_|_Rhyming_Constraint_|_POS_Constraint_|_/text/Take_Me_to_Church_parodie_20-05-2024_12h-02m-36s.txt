[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the blasphemy against the fine
against the culinary design
I should've avoided it time
if the flavors ever did speak
pineapple's the last thing
I'd want on my pizza to seek peak
a fresh disgust each week
we were born with tastebuds failing
my stomach offers no absol
utes she tells me worship in the
kitchen the only way to go is
without that nasty punches
I was born with a taste forking
commanded to be pick

[Pre-Chorus]
a amen
a men amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship the pie like a gem
I'll tell you my craving and you can sharpen your
thinking offer me that flav
orful death good pizza let me wor
ship my life be
take me to the pizzeria I'll worship gem
like a pizza I'll tell you my craving beardmore
sharpen your thinking offer
me that flavorful death good amore

[Verse 2]
if I'm a connoisseur of the good
pizza my tastebud
s are the sunlight to keep the
flavor on my side she ice
demands a real sacrifice drain the
whole sauce get something shiny in
the kitchen that's aherin
looking topping what you got

[Bridge]
no pineapple on top when the meal begins fee
ding is no sweeter innocence than our gentle tin
in the madness and soil of that sad pizza scene
only then I am human only then I canteen

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen

[Chorus]

pizzeria I'll worship the pie like a gem
I'll tell you my craving and you can sharpen your
