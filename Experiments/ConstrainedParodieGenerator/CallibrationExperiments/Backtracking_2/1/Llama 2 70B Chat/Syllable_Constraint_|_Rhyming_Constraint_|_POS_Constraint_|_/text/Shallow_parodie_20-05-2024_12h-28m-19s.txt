[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me somethin
is pineapple on pizza really
somethin' that you need
or is it just a silly frenzied

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm callin
in all the bad times I find myself balkin
at the
thought of pineapple on a piecrust

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me somethin
is a fruit that don't belong on a
pizza somthing you
can't get enough of or isuzu

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in all the good times I find myself calling
for a
different topping something that's not

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end pineapple on a
pizza can't be real
crash through the menu where the flavors don't
meet we're far from the tasteful

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow in
the sha ha la la la low oflyn
in the sha ha shallow pin
apple on a pizza don

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end pineapple on a
pizza can't be real
crash through the menu where the flavors don't
meet we're far from the tasteful

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow
in the sha ha la la laurino
in the sha haavelmo
pineapple on a pizza
