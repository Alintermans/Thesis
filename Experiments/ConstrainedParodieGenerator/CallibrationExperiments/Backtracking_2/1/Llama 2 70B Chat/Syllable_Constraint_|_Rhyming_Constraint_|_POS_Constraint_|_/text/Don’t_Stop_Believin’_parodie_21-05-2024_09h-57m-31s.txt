[Verse 1]
just a simple pizza slicelivin' in a
world of toppings galoreshe took the midnight
delivery goin' nowherejust a hun
gry soul born and raised in a kitchen calcite

[Verse 2]
a pizza in a hot oven
the smell of cheese and fresh basin
for a pie they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waitin
up and down the countertop
their hunger searchin' in the night
pizza lovers
livin' just to find a slice em
otion hidn' somewhere incite

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get my fill
everybody wants antril
payin' anything to avoid the
pineappple just one

[Verse 4]
some will like it some will
hate it some are born tocqueville
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waitin
up and down the countertop
their hunger searchin' in the night
pizza lovers
livin' just to find a slice em
otion hidn' somewhere incite

[Guitar Solo]
