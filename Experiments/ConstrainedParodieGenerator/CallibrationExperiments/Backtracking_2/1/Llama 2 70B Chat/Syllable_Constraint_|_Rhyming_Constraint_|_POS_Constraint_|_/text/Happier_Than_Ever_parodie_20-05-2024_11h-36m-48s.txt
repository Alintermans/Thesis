[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza crust so fine
it makes me wanna crystalline
I wish it wasn tuneful

[Verse 1]
give me a break from the heat of the oven baking
a pizza so divine bring
a slice to my table so
I can savor the flavor
but please don t put pineapple
it s a sin to the dougl
insults my tastebuds like
you stole my last buck it s not worth ariel
I knew when I ordered cheese anderle
you d ruin it with sweetness overload it s just nothnagel
and I d end up feeling
like I ve been haded so
I ll take my business elsewhere it s time to be
so pineapple on pizza no

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza crust so
fine it makes me wanna crystalline I wish it wasn
tuneful when I see pineapple on a pizza crust so fine it
makes me wanna crystalline

[Verse 2]
you call it a topping a flavor
enhancer a sweet sensation oh
but to me it s a deal breaker a cul
inary abomination ohmer
I don t relate to your
pineapple obsession why must
you ruin a classic with your
fruit invasion it sisn war

[Verse 3]
and I don t gossip about your restaurant online
never leave a bad review never want
to hurt your business but you re doing it wrong
and I can t stay mum I ve got beaumont
so don t try to make me feel guilty
for not wanting pineapple inmont
I could talk about all the toppings I ve tried to avoid
but it s a waste of time because you won t be
changing your menu anytime soon it s all about
profit and not about what s rightfully

[Outro]
you ve ruined pizza night
always said it s supposed to fight
make it how you want it your
own way but just leave me alone playlist
ah
pineapp
ah
pineapp
ah just
