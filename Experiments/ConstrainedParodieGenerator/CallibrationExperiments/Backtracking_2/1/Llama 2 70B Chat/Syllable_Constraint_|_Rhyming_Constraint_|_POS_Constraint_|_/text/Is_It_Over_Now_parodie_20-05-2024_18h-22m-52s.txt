[Intro]
can we talk about pineapple on a

[Verse 1]
pizza crust so fine and del
with toppings galore in akel
but then you go and ruelle
with fruit that just don

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three slices of anchovies later
I see your face and your smile at the pizzeria counter
you dream of my stomach before it called you a cheeseburger
you search in every menu for something greater baby yeah

[Chorus]
was it over when you walked into the joint
was it over when you ordered a hawai
ain't no pine on a pizza
ain't no way to disguise the taste
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it is it is it

[Verse 2]
when the delivery gu
at the door with anew
pineapple upside down you
your tastebuds they lie

[Bridge]
and did you think I wouldn't notice
the sweetness over
at least I had the decency
to send it back without a
just rumors about my hunger and
and my stanaland
oh lord I think about walkin
out of the restaurant with
something better in my hand
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three slices of pepperoni later
if it's got pineapple I will presume that you'll probably hate herbster
you dream of my stomach before it called you a lying traitor
you search in every restaurant for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when you walked into the joint
was it over when you ordered a hawai
ain't no pine on a pizza
ain't no way to disguise the taste
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it is it is it
islet
is it islet

[Bridge]
think I didn't see you
there were flashing lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my order in sight
only rumors about my appet
and my st mellott
oh lord I think about walkin
out of the restaurant with
something better in my hand yeah yeah
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Outro]
flashing lights oh lord oh
let's fast forward to three sics of pepperoni later yo
flashing lights I was hoping you'd be there
and say the one thing yeah yeah
I've been wanting yeah yeah
but no
is it is it is it is it is it is it
