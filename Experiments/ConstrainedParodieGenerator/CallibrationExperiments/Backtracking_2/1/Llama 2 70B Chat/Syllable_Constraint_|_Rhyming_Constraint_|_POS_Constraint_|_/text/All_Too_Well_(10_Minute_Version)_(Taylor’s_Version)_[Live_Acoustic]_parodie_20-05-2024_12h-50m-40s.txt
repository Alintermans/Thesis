[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong it was
like a crime scene without a care and nowhere

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory crave sangria
we ordered a pie getting lost in flavor
pepperoni and sausage falling down like rain
and I can picture it after all these de

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that taste is not here no more
and I might be okay but my taste buds are not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost dropped the slice because you were looking at me with
pepperoni in my hair
I was there I remember it

[Verse 3]
photo of anchovies on the menu counter makes me
your love for pineapple on pizza was always a turn off redi
t's like you're a different person with a different taste
you used to be a little kid with a big appet
and your mother's telling stories bout you eating alegrett
you told me bout your cravings thinking your future
was me and you were tossing me the slice fuck the hat
ers key chain on the ground we were always skipping town we
were always skipping town and I
was thinking on the drive down he's gonna say
it's love you never called it
what it was until we were dead and gone and buried check
the pulse and come back swearing it's the same after re

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refigera re
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an
oath sacred prayer itches
we'd swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a pro
mise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paper here
cause I remember it all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you doublecross my taste
you said if we had been closer in flavor maybe it would have been
fine and that made me want to
die the idea you had of me who was
she a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
not weeping in a party bathroom
some pizza asking me what happened you
that's what happened you
you who charmed my taste buds with self effacing
jokes sipping soda like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the pizza delivery guy all night
willing you to come and he said it's supposed to be fun

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to fidget
after pizza days and nights when you made me your own
now you take back my pepperoni and lupone
home alone but you keep my old slice from that first
week cause it reminds you of innocence and it doesn
tastes like me you can't get
rid of it cause you remember it

[Chorus]
cause there we are again when I loved you
so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well wind in my hair itches
you were there you were there
you remember itches
down the stairs you were there
you remember it was
rare I was there itches soohoo

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pizza stays my age
from when your hawaiian pizza broke heart
and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half
my weight and did the love affair paint
you blue just between us did the love affair faint
you too cause in this city
barren cold I still remember the first
snow and how it glistened as it
fell I remember it all it

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair paint you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too ell
just between us I remember it all too well wind in asbell
down the stairs you were there you were there you
remember it it was rare you do
you remember it all too well do
you remember it all too well do dovel
ou remember it all too well ayscue
wind in my hair you were there you ou
were there you remember itochu
down the stairs you were there you were

[Spoken Outro]
