[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to fix our me
for the toppings that don't belong
I think that's the first step right

[Verse]
I've dug a hole for pineapple
can't pretend that it's a pizza topping it' sinsel
oh man what a world the things I hear
if I could act on my hunger no would I
some like it hot some like it cold
but pineapple on pizza makes me feel old would you have
thought that I would let it slide and let you
eat your pizza with a slice of pineapple on the side well
broken pizzas break my heart will
you have thought that I would let it go and let you dial
for pineapple on pizza grier
well broken pizzas break my heart so hereby
I declare pineapple ahold
and I don't wanna let it go so in my st nav
I'll rot against pineapple on pannu
I've dug a hole for pineapple my dear cannot at pantel

[Chorus]
in my stomach it
in my stomach it
in my stomach it ot ot
in my st it vitt
in my stomach itami
in my stomach it

[Outro]
