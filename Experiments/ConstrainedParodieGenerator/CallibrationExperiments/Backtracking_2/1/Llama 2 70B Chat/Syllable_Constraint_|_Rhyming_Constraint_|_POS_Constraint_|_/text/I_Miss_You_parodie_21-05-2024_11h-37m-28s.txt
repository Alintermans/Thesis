[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pizza that I adair
the topping that I fear in the kitchen
the unpredictable flav
of sweet and savory mix
we can live without pineapple and still have
a taste that's divine sconnix
and we'll have a culinary dream
and in the night we'll wish this never ends
we'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab
I abhor itami

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor and I'm so
sorry I cannot fathom tonight how
pineapple belongs on any
culinary del
ion this strange combination comes creeping
on so haunts every time
and as I ponder I've con
cluded pineapple has got to go
and let the classic toppings we
know be the only ones we
know be the only ones we know gienow
know be the rakow

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's just
already the voice of
disagreement inside
my mouth don't waste your time on pragmatist
it's already the voice
of disagred inside

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's just
already the voice of
disagreement inside
my mouth don't waste your time on pragmatist
it's already the voice
of disagred inside
my mouth don't waste your time on pugilist
it's already the voice
of disagred inside
my mouth don't waste your time on pessimist
it's already the voice
of disagred inside

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab
I abhor itami
I abhor it I ab
I abhor itami
