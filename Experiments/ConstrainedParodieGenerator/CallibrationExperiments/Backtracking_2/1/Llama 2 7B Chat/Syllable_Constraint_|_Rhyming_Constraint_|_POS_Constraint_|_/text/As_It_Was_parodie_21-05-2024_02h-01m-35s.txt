[Intro]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pie to

[Verse 1]
sweet and tangy
flavors clashing inwardly
it doesn't belong on my pie to fly high
why must you try to deny me
innocence lost
when toppings collide in defrost
pineapple doesn't reson
and I'm the king of the pizza line to

[Chorus]
in this pizza world it
you know it's not the same as my heart
in this pizza world it
you know it's not the same as my start
as my pizza capehart
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
spicy sausage
juicy it takes the cottage
pepperonI's got my heart aflutter
I'll never surrender to
pineapple's all
and I'll never surrender to
you know I'll always be the
pizza king of the land to be free to be

[Chorus]
in this pizza world it
you know it's not the same as my heart
in this pizza world it
you know it's not the same as my start
as my pizza capehart
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
stay away from my pineapple toppings
I don't want to hear about the way that it was
leave the pineapple in hawaii where
it belongs so far away to hawaii where it

[Outro]
don
as it was
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
