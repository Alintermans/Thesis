[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something''
pineapple on pizza ain''t right
or do you crave more
an odd taste that leaves you wanting more

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
it's appall
in the good times I''m craving a recall
for change
in the bad times it just feels so strange

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
are you tired of this culinary
ploy or do you need
an aberration to fulfill indeed

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
it''s a
fallacy in the good times it bettina
for change
in the bad times it leaves a bad taste

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I''m off the deep end into dismay
at the sight of this mon
crash through the surface where it doesn''t belong
we''re far from the shallow

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pineapple tray
in the sha detestation today
in the sha pineapple stay
we''re far from the shallow

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh pineapple
oh myrtle

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I''m off the deep end into dismay
at the sight of this mon
crash through the surface where it doesn''t belong
we''re far from the shallow

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pineapple
in the sha culinary bumble
in the sha pineal
we''re far from the shallow
