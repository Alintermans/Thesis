[Verse 1]
just a small town slicefar from a pineapple
a classic pie with cheese and pepperoni
there's no room for fruit on a savory dishlike
it's a sin to put pineapple onishi

[Verse 2]
a slice in hand at the local
the taste of dough and tangible
for a bite they gladly partake
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
lining up the avenue
their mouths yearning in delightful
cheesy goodness
livin' just to bite emotion
hidden in the dough andal

[Verse 3]
cooking low and slow to get
satisfaction in myette
pineapple belongs on a fruit plate
not a pizza

[Verse 4]
some prefer pineapple
but they don't know aural
pleasure of a pure pizza
it goes on and on and on or on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
lining up the avenue
their mouths yearning in delightful
cheesy goodness
livin' just to bite emotion
hidden in the dough andal

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't add pineapple
let the cheese and pepper
oni flavor
don't add pineal
og to
dough andover
don't add pineapple
let the cheese and pepper
oni flavor
