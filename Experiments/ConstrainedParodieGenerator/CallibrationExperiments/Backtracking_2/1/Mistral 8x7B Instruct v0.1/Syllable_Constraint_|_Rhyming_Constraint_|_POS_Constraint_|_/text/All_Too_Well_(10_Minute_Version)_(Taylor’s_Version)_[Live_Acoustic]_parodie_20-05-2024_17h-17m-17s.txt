[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I spit it out in the trash with disgust
you just laughed and said it's a deluxe dish now

[Verse 2]
oh my gosh that taste on my tongue was horrendousness
we argued for hours which toppers are the
bessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
t ones for pizza no way no how yanis

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pineapple has no place
and I might be okay but I'm not content at
all oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it sits again on that triangle
slice of pizza a monstrosity that's hard to believe in
hammered in my brain I was
there I remember it all too

[Verse 3]
chef rants on tv preaching pineapple's delightfulness
but I won't believe it till the cows come home from pasture nibbles
and you're still eating pineapple on your pizza all nonchal
I cringe inside while you're munching on that travesty
and I remember the first time I saw you eat itami
flabbergasted at the sight of pineapple on
pizza I was there I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to annoy me with your
pizza choice I remember it
all too well yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh oh
over and over and the
taste still lingers in my mouth I remember it all too
well yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh oh oh ohio

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pineapple has no place no
way no how and I might be okay but
I'm not content at all oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it sits again on that triangle slice
of pizza a monstrosity that's hard to believe excise
from the menu I was
there I remember it all too
well and I remember it all too well yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
ohio yeah yeah yeah
