[Intro]
come on folks, we all wanna speak out on this ver

[Verse 1]
firm stance taken
pineapple's not partisan
I want you to take a slice off your plate now
why don't we leave it at that
no debate brew
when taste buds rebel and eschew
that sweet fruit doesn't belong
on a savory slice of pizza gone

[Chorus]
in this mealtime world it
just doesn't sit quite as well as it
should on a pizza it
just doesn't taste quite as good as it
once did before it split
our taste buds apart

[Verse 2]
answer the call
don't let pineapple fall
on your pizza slice again tonight now
what reason could there be for
pineapple's reign
it's time to break free from this chain
let tomato sauce and cheese
be the only things on your pizza please now

[Chorus]
in this mealtime world it
just doesn't sit quite as well as it
should on a pizza it
just doesn't taste quite as good as it
once did before it split
our taste buds apart

[Bridge]
go home folks and make amends today now
let's put pineapple aside and find a new way now
propose a new topping and share it with
your friends and family and lift up your spirits then

[Outro]
hey
in this meal
pineapple's just not the same appeal
as it was as anneal
