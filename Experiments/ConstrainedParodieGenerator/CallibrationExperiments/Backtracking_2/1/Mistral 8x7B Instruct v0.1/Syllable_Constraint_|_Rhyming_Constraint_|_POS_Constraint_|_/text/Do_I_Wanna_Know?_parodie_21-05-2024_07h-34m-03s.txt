[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple on your
slice a turnoff that just can't slide off your tongue quite right
does it clash with ham like red and purple
color schemes that make your stomach
churn and question your life choices this night
have you no shame in your game as you order a pie
with that sweet and tangy onsite
are there no standards
that your taste buds abide by making you wonder why you tried
as you spit it out in disbelief while your friends

[Pre-Chorus]
can't believe their eyes as you push it aside
sorry for the scene you've created at the table
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
on a pizza meant for savories not fruits fable

[Chorus]
leaving pine on the
side of your dish ever thought
of ordering
without theta
stickin outta
your slice like a sore
thumb now I've thought italy
through leaving pine a
side of your pizza

[Verse 2]
so do you think you have
the nerve to try it again to see if
it's just as bad or maybe even worse nav
idgaf about the toppings you choose just don't ruin
my slice with that crap that makes me wanna hurl and lose it all
but we can still be friends even if we don' atoll
or agree on the best way to enjoy meatball

[Pre-Chorus]
can't believe their eyes as you push it aside
sorry for the scene you've created at the table
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
on a pizza meant for savories not fruits fable

[Chorus]
leaving pine on the side of your dish craw
lin' back to you ever thought
of ordering without a
fruit salad on your plate now crawshaw
back to you leaving pine a faraway
from your pizza pie baby we
both know that piney inlaw

[Outro]

both know that pineapple doesn't go on a pizza
by the slice meant for savories not fruits fable
leaving pine on the side of your pizza where ita

t belong on a pizza meant for savories not
