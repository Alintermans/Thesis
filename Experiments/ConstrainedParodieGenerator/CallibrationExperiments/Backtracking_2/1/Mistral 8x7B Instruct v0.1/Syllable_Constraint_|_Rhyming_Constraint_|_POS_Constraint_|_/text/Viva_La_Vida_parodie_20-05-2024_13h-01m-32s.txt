[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love my pie
topped with cheese up in the sky now
in the morning I take a slice too
finding pine apple juju

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to savor each
bite of pepperoni within reach
listen as the crowd would cheer
now they say pineapple is weird oneyear
one moment it tasted so
next it left a bitter glow
and I found that my delight turned sour
on pizza with pineapple power hour

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear schoolyard bells a ringing' ringing
kids refusing pineapple in their
be my anchovy and mushroom
my savory toppings in a classroom
for some reason I can't explain
once you tasted pineapple
there was never an un
disgusted word but that was when

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wild and crazy thought
pineapple on a pizza plot
shattered trust and the sound of laughter
people couldn't fathom what came after
vegetarians waitin
for my sweet surrender atkin
just a heretic on a lonely plateaw
aw who would ever want pineapple

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear schoolyard bells a ringing' ringing
kids refusing pineapple in their
be my anchovy and mushroom
my savory toppings in a classroom
for some reason I can't explain
I know pizza hut won' do the same dish
never an honest word
but that was when pineapple was

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
hear schoolyard bells a ringing' ringing
oh oh oh on theano
roman cavalry choirs are singin
oh oh oh on thebeau
be my anchovy and mushroom
oh oh oh on theo
my savory toppings in a bedroom
oh oh oh on theano
for some reason I can't explain
oh oh oh on beaudreau
I know pizza hut won't allow it
never an honest word
but that was when pineapple was
