He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nall my sins need holy water washing over me like wine\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's coming home with pineapple on his slice\nsweat jackets and brown rice mismatched\non his breath's ketchup he'll pay the price\nshe just wants to get rid of the pineapple twice\nit's a mess matching flavors don't mix device\non his plate's pineapple a culprit\nbut she's devised a plan to take it off his plate real quick\npizza purist won't allow pineapple on a sticky ticket\nshe's a traditionalist\nand you don't top a pizza like that even I know\nbut she's removed the pineapple to try fordice\nknife in hand says the pizza's hangin' by a strand flavor\nso she's been on the net lately\nsays maybe she'll make a pizza without pineapple\nand I know she's using me to prove a pointless pointless pointless\nhi susan but I shoulda said by eagle\nafter the first bite but tonight I am\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nall my sins need holy water washing over me like wine\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one night stand turned a two night stand meal\nit was come sunshine scram now we hug tight and chill\nhe found out now she feels cheated and betrayed\nbut he left so what he did it first to her\nnow how am I supposed to tell this girl that weirder\nwe can't have pineapple on our pizza her\nit's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and sue don\nknow how to say it in person to you so I revert to thelander\nlike hole in the wall diners don't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who ikon\nturning into is irreversible I prayed on\nyou like it's church at the pew and now that I got you iver\nwant you took advantage in my thalheimer\nhunger to pursue why do I dohner\nthis dirt that I do get onlooker\nmy soapbox and preach my sermon and speech deter\ngent and bleach is burning the wound because\nnow with pineapple on\nour pizza we can't bring it incur\nthis world shoulda knew to use protection before I bit in\nfur\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's sorry my name\nmy name\na\nriver run\ncall me sorry aflame\nriver run we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the joker saying pineapple\non pizza's fineline's ariel\nfuck can I say if pizza was a highway deception\nand pineapple was an enclave I'd be swerving in\nfive lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm slid\ning on ice maybe that's the\nreason I may have came icy spurgeon\nall crazy with the lies I can't keep straight but\nI made you terminate the pineapple on\nour pizza a tragic oman\nflavor love triangle left us in a wreck\noman what else can I say it was fun for\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nall my sins need holy water washing over me like wine\nwell little one\nI malign\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif will all\n\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\n",
