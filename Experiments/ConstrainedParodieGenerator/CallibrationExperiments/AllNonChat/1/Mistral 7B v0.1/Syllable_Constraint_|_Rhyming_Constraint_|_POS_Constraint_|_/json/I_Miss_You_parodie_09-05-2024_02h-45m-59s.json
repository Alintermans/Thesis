And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you I miss you\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nhello there\nthe angel from my nightmare\nthe shadow in the background of the grave\nthe unsuspecting victim\nof darkness in the valley\nwe can live like jack and sally if we want\nwhere you can always findley\nand we'll have halloween on christmas\nand in the night we will wish this never\nends we will wish theiler\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you I miss you\nI miss you I miss you\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere are you and I am so sor\nI cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nthis sick strange darkness\ncomes creeping on so haunting every time\nand as I stare I counted\nthe websites from all the\nspiders catching things and eating their\ninsides like indecision to\ncall you and hear your voice of\ntreason will you come home and stop allright\nstop all riunite\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't waste your time upon me you are now\nthe voice inside my head\nI miss you I miss you\n\ndon't waste your time upon me you are now\nthe voice inside my head\nI miss you I miss you\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't waste your time upon me you are now\nthe voice inside my head\nI miss you I miss you\n\ndon't waste your time upon me you are now\nthe voice inside my head\nI miss you I miss you\n\ndon't waste your time upon me you are now\nthe voice inside my head\nI miss you I miss you\n\ndon't waste your time upon me you are now\nthe voice inside my head\nI miss you I miss you\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you I miss you\nI miss you I miss you\nI miss you I miss you\n",
