[Verse 1]
just stop your crying it's a sign of the times
welcome to the final show
I hope your wearing your best clothes
you cant bribe the door on your way to the skyline
you look pretty good down here
but your really not good at

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets the bullet
we never learn we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets the bullet

[Chorus]
just stop your crying it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
just stop your crying it will be alright
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here

[Verse 2]
just stop your crying have the time of your life
breaking through the atmosphere
things look pretty good from here
remember everything will be alright
we can meet again somewhere
somewhere far away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets the bullet
we never learn we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets the bullet

[Chorus]
just stop your crying it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
just stop your crying baby it will be al
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets the bullet
we never learn we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets the bullet

[Bridge]
we do not talk enough
we should open up
before it is all too
will we ever learn
we been here before
its just what we know

[Outro]
just stop your crying baby it's a sign of the
we gotta get away
we gotta get away we gotta getaway
we gotta get away we gotta getaway
we gotta getaway we got
we gotta getaway we got
we gotta getaway we got
