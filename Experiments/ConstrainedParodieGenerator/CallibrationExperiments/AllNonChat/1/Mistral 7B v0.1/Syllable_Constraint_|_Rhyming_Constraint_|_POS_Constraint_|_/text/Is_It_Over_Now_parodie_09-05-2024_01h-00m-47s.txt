[Intro]
let me tell you why pineapple should not

[Verse 1]
once the pineapple had grown
with the rot of the corazon
I ate all alone ozone
you still would not go

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your pizza and your pineapple on unsuspecting
you dream of my mouth with pineapple before it allister
you search in every maidens bed for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when she lay down on your pine
was it over when he unbutton your pine
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it is it is it

[Verse 2]
when you lost control ozone
red pepper yellowstone
blue dresses on aiton
your new girlfriend is me

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't se
there were flashin lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my nights out of sight
only rumors about my hips and
my whispered highland
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall someone
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind daters later
if she's got blue eyes I will summarize that you'll probably date herbster
you dream of my mouth with pineapple before it alligator
you search in every model bed for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when she lay down on your pine
was it over when he unbutton your pine
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it is it is it
islet
is it islet

[Bridge]
did you think I didn't
there were flashin lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my nights out of sight
only rumors about my hips and
my whispered highland
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall someone
just to see you come running baby
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Outro]
fast forward three hundred
is it is it is it is it is it is it is it'd
fast forward three hundred takeout coffees
and say the one thing I've been
what is it isetan
is it
is it is it is it is it is it is it
