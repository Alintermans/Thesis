[Verse 1]
just a small town girl living in a lonely world
she took the midnight train going anywhere
just a city boy raised in south detroit city
he took the midnight train going anywhere

[Verse 2]
a singer with a microphone
the smell of sound and aiton
for a smile they could share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their shadows exploring in the
nighttime peoples
living just to find emotion
hidden somewhere ineptly

[Verse 3]
working hard to get my fill
everybody wants a chill
payment anything to roll the dice
just one more time

[Verse 4]
some will winning some will
losing some are upheaval
oh the movie never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their shadows exploring in the
nighttime peoples
living just to find emotion
hidden somewhere ineptly

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
people nightlights
don't stop believing
hold on
people daylights
don't stop believing
keep on believing ing
people day lights
