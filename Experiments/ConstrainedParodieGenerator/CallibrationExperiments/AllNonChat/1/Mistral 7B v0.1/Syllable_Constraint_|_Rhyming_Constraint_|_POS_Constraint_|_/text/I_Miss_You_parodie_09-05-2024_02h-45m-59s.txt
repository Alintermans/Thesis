[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the angel from my nightmare
the shadow in the background of the grave
the unsuspecting victim
of darkness in the valley
we can live like jack and sally if we want
where you can always findley
and we'll have halloween on christmas
and in the night we will wish this never
ends we will wish theiler

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where are you and I am so sor
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
this sick strange darkness
comes creeping on so haunting every time
and as I stare I counted
the websites from all the
spiders catching things and eating their
insides like indecision to
call you and hear your voice of
treason will you come home and stop allright
stop all riunite

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time upon me you are now
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you
don't waste your time upon me you are now
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time upon me you are now
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you
don't waste your time upon me you are now
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you
don't waste your time upon me you are now
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you
don't waste your time upon me you are now
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
