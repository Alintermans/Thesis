[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you the air was cold
but something about it felt like home somehow
and I left my pizza there at your uncle
and you've still got it in your drawer even now

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet pineapple disposition and my wide
eyed gaze were singing in the car getting lost
upstate and autumn leaves falling down like pieces
into place and I can picture it after

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that magic's not here no more
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
because there we are again on that little
town street you almost ran the red cause you were looking over
at me wind In my hair I
was there I remember it all

[Verse 3]
photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little kid with pineapple in a twin bedspread
and your mother's telling stories about you on the soccer
team and your telling me about your past thinking your
future was me and you were tossing me the car kisamore
keys fuck the patriarchy key chain on the ground
we were always skipping town and I was thinking on
the drive down any time now he's gonna say it's love you
never called it what it was till
we were dead and gone and buried check the pulse
and come back swearing it's the
same after three months in the grave and then you wondered where
it went to as I reached for you but all I felt was

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
because there we are again in the middle of
the night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refriger of
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an
oath sacred andrea
and we'd swear to remember it all

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
until you tore it
all up running scared I
was there I remember it all
all all all and you call me up again just to break me like
a promise so casually cruel in the name of be
ing honest I'm a crumpled up piece of paper
lying here cause I remember

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double crossed my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needing ever loving jewel whose shine reflects on you you
who charmed my dad with self effacing
jokes sipping coffee like you reissue
late night sisulu
but then he watched me watch the front door all night
willing you to come and he said it's supposed to
be fun turning twenty one but I'm still trying to find it af
ter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you

[Verse 5]
mail back my things and I walk home alone but you
keep my old pizza from that very first week cause it reminds you o
f innocence and it smells like me you can't get
rid of it cause you remember it all omit
well because there we are again when I loved you
so before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I wasiyu
there I remember it all too well

[Chorus]
because there we are again when I loved
you so before you lost the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well wind in my hair itches
you were there you remem
ber it alliances

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your lovers stay my age
from when your pizza broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldiers returning half her weight you
broken cold I still remember the
first fall of snow and how it glistened asahi
fells I remember it all
