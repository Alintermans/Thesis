[Verse]
comin' out of my cage and I been doing just fine
gotta gotta be down because I want it all
it started out with a kiss how did it end up like this
it was only a kiss it was only aly
now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
while he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's touching his chest now
he takes off her dress now
let me go
and I just can't look it's killing me
and taking control

[Chorus]
jealousy turning saints into the sea
swimming through sick lullabies
choking on your alibis
but it's just the price I pay
destiny islamically
open up my eager eyes
because I'm mister

[Guitar Solo]
