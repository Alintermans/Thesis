[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to forgive myself
for the mistakes I made in my past
I think that's the first step right
you agree

[Verse]
I've dug two graves for us my dear
can't pretend that I was perfect leaving you in fear
oh man what a world the things I hear
if I could act on my revenge no would he
some kill some steal some break your heart
and you would have thought that I would let it go and let you
well broken hearts break bones so break up fast
and I don't wanna let it go so in my grave I'll rot
I've dug two graves for us my dear
can't pretend that I was perfect leaving you in fear
oh man what a world the things I hear
if I could act on my revenge noisily
some kill some steal some break upstart
and you would have thought that I would let it go and breakthrough
well broken hearts break bones so rebroadcast
and I don't wanna let it go so in my grave I rott

[Chorus]
in my garage we
in mycology
in my galaxy we rot
in my galaxy
in my galaxy we rott
in my gallery

[Outro]
in my galaxy
I'm rolling myslinski
is my pain your freedom
is all of my pain your freedom
