[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
favorite food of all time
because it tastes so good
you can never ever go wrong with it
that's why I love pineapple on a pizza because
it tastes so good you can

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I scream sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what infrared
and I i am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey

I said hey hey hey hey hey hey
and I say hey heyday

I said hey hey hey hemenway

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I scream sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what infrared
and I i am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's going on
