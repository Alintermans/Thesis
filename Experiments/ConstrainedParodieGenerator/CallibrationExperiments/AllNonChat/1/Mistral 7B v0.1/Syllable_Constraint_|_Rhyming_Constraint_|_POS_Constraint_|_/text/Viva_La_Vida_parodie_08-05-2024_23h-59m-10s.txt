[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I ate a pineapple
felt goosebumps all over me
now in the morning I sleep alone
sitting on the cornerstone

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I loved the pineapple
feel the pain in my bellybutton
listen as the crowd was sing
now the old king is alive longstanding
one minute I hold the fruit
after that feel bitterroot
and I discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of sodium ferdinand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear jerusalem bells a'ringin
roman cavalery choirs are sing
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason I can't explain
once you'd gone there was never
never an honest word
and that was when I ruled the world

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldn't believe what I'd become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silicate
just a puppeteer on a lonely string ah
aw who would ever wanna be king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear jerusalem bells a'ringin
roman cavalery choirs are sing
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when I ruled the world

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh ohio
oh oh oh oh io
io io io

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohio ohio
hear jerusalem bells a'ringin
ohio ohio
roman cavalery choirs are sing
ohio ohio
be my mirror my sword and shield
ohio ohio
my missionaries in a foreign field
ohio ohio
for some reason I can't explain
ohio ohio
I know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when I ruled the world

[Outro]
mm mmm mmmmmmmmmmmmm oh
oh ohio
