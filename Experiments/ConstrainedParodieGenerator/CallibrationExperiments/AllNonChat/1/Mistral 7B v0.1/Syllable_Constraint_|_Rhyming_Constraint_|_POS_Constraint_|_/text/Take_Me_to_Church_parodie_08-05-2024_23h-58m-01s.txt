[Verse 1]
my lover's got humor
she is the joke at the funeral
knows everybody's disapproval
I should have worshipped her sooner
if the heavens ever did speak
she is the last true mouth
every sunday is getting more
bleak a fresh poison each
we were born sick you heard them say it
my church offers no absolut
she tells me worship in the bedroom
the only heaven I will be sent
is when I am alone with
I was born sick but I love it
command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
a amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to church
I will worship like a dog at the altar of
your lies I will tell you my sins and you can shar
pen your knife offer me that
deathless death oh good god let meghdar
you my life per
take me to church I will worship like aversive
dog at the altar of your lies I will tell you
my sins and you can sharpen
your knife offer me that death mylar

[Verse 2]
if I am a believer of the
good times my lover is
the sunshine to keep the goddess
on my side she demands a
sacrifice drain the whole sea get some
things shiny something meaty for
the main course that isidore
it is hungry work we have
a lot of starving faithful hal
these is tasty thatcherism
this is hungry work

[Chorus]
take me to church
I will worship like a dog at the alter of
your lies I will tell you my sins and you can shar
pen your knife offer me that
deathless death oh good god let mylar
you my life per
take me to church I will worship like aversive
dog at the altar of your lies I will telstar
sharpen your knife offer me
that deathless death oh good gumaer

[Bridge]
no masters or kings when the ritual begins
there is no sweater innocence than our general
sin in the madness and soil of that sad earthly
scene only then I am human only myslinski

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to church
I will worship like a dog at the altar of
your lies I will tell you my sins and you can shar
pen your knife offer me that
deathless death oh good god let meghdar
you my life per
take me to church I will worship like aversive
dog at the altar of your lies I will tell you
my sins and you can sharpen
your knife offer me that death mylar
