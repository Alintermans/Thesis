[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret food
that pineapples could and it pleased the
lord but you don't really care for fruits do ya
it goes like this the fourth the fifth
the minor fall the major lift
the baffled king composing oh no pizza

[Chorus]
oh no pizza oh no pizza
oh no pizza ohkawara

[Verse 2]
your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing shatterproof
her beauty in the saucepan overthrew ya
she tied you to a kitchen chair
she broke your order and heidiwear
and from your lips she drew the oh no pizza

[Chorus]
oh no pizza oh no pizza
oh no pizza ohkawara

[Verse 3]
you say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a slice of light in every word
it doesn't matter which you heard
the holy or the broken oh no pizza

[Chorus]
oh no pizza oh no pizza
oh no pizza ohkawara

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't feel so I tried to touch
I've told the truth I did not come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
with nothing on my tongue but oh no pizza

[Chorus]
oh no pizza oh no pizza
oh no pizza ohkawara
oh no pizza oh noyola
oh no pizza oh noxema
oh no pizza oh noleta
oh no pizza oh nokia
oh no pizza oh nolita
oh no pizza oh nolana
oh no pizza oh nolanda

[Outro]
oh no pizza oh no pizza

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this room I amador
I used to live alone before I knew you
and I've seen your oven on the marble
archature is not anibal
it's a cold and it's a broken oh no pizza

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I wasiyu
the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was oh no pizza

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shot at someone who outdid you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who israel
it's a cold and it's a broken oh no pizza
