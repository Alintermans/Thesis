do you ever get that fear that you are so behind that
you cannot shift the tide that sticks around
like something in your teeth are there
are there some aces up your sleeve that you
have no idea that you are in deep I have dream
about you nearly every
night this week how man
y secrets can you keep because there is this tune I found that
makes me think of you somehow and I play it on

sad to see you go was sort of hoping that you would
baby we both know that the nights were mainly made
