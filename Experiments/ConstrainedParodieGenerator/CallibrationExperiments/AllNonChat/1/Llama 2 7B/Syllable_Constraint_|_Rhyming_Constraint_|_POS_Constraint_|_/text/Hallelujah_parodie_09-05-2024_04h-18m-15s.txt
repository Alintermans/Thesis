[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret song
that david wrote and it scuppernong
but you don't really care for music do ya
it goes like this the fourth the fifth
the minor fall the major lift
the baffled choir singing harmony ha

[Chorus]
hallelujah halleluja
hallelujah hacienda

[Verse 2]
your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her drinking waterproof
her beauty in the moonlight made ya icy
she tied you to a kitchen chair
she broke you bank and she cut your la
and from your lips he drew the hallowala

[Chorus]
hallelujah halleluja
hallelujah hacienda

[Verse 3]
you say I took the number in
I don't even know the name
but if I did well really whats it to ya
there's a blazing light in every word
its doesn't matter which you heard
the horny or the broken hallowala

[Chorus]
hallelujah halleluja
hallelujah hacienda

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't feel so I tried to touch
I've told the truth I didn't comto fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
with nothing on my tongue but hallowala

[Chorus]
hallelujah hacienda
hallelujah halimeda
hallelujah hagiwara
hallelujah hirayama
hallelujah hayashida
hallelujah hiroshima
hallelujah honoria
hallelujah hosokawa
hallelujah hyacintha

[Outro]
hallelujah hagiwara

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I been here before
I know this room I' amador
I used to live alone before I knew you
and I've seen your flag upon the marble
song is not a victory march
its a cold and its a broken hallowala

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going undergo
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I wasiyu
the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallowala

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there is a god of
but all I ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdid you
and its not a cry that you hear at night
its not somebody who israel
its a cold and its a broken hallowala
