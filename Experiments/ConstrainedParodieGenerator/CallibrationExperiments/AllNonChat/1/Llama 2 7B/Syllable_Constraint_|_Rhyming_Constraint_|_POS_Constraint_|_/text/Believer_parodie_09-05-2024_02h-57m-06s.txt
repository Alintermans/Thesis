[Verse 1]
labor day
thankful for every day we get to
he asked me to marry him on
every time I try to leave
the door is locked by mahariv

[Verse 2]
second things second
didn't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sale
I'm the master of my sea oh oh
the master of my sea oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
taking my sulking to the masses
writing my poem for the few
that look at me took to me shook at me feelin me
singing from heartache from the pain
taking my messages from the
veins speaking my less overlain
from the brain seein the beauty through

[Chorus]
pain you made me a you made me a
beliver beliver
pain you break me down you build me up
beliver believer
oh let the bullets fly let them rain my life
my love my drive it came from pain pain
pain you made me a you madeira
beliver belabor

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a piano to the ones up
above all the hate that
you heard has turned your spirit to a dove
your spirit up above olive

[Pre-Chorus]
I was choosing in the crowd
building my rain up overcrow
falling like ashes to the ground
hoping my feelings they would drop
but they never did ever living ebbin and flow
inhibited limited till it broke open rasterop
it broke open

[Chorus]
pain you made me a you made me a
beliver beliver
pain you break me down you build me up
beliver believer
oh let the bullets fly let them rain my life
my love my drive it came from pain pain
pain you made me a you madeira
beliver belabor

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the fireplace and the
flames you are the face of the
future the blood in my ve
ins oh oh theology

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ever living ebbin and flow
inhibited limited till it broke open rasterop
it broke open

[Chorus]
pain you made me a you made me a
beliver beliver
pain you break me down you build me up
beliver believer
oh let the bullets fly let them rain my life
my love my drive it came from pain pain
pain you made me a you madeira
beliver belabor
