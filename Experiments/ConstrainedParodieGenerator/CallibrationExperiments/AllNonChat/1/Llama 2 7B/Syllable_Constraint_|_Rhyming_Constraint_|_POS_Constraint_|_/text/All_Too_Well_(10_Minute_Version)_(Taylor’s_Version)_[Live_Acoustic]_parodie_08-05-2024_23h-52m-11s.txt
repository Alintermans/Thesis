[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you the air was cold
but something about it felt like home somehow
and I left my clothes there at your parents house
and you've still got it in our dresser now

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet disposition and my wide eyes gazewe
are singing in the car getting lost upstate
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
and I can picture it after alexi

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know its long gone and
that magic is not here no
and I might be okay but I am not fine at
all oh oh

[Chorus]
because there we are again on that little
town street you almost ran the red because you were looking at
me wind in my hair I was
there I remember it all too

[Verse 3]
photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin cadenhead
and your mother telling stories about you on the tee ball
team you told me about your past thinking your future
was me and you were tossing me the car keys f uglier
politics and I was there I remember it
all too well photo album on the counter your che
eks were turning red you used to be a little kid with
glasses in a twin cadenhead
and your mother telling stories about you
on the tee ball team you told
me about your past thinking your future was me and you
were tossing me the car keys f uglier isu

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know its long gone and
that magic is not here no more
and I might be okay but I am not
fine at all oh oh oradour

[Chorus]
because there we are again in the middle of
the night we are dancing around the kitchen in the freelove
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an
oath sacred andrea
we swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a master piece
until you tore it
all up running scared I
was there I remember it all
too well and you call me up again just to break me like a
promise so casually cruel in the name of being
honest I am a crumpled up piece of paper
lying here because I remem

[Verse 4]
they say alls well that ends well but I am in a new
hell every time you double cross me
mind you say if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been
fine and that made me want to
die the idea you had of me who was
she a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
not weeping in a party bathroom
some actress asking me what happened you
that is what happened
you who charmed my dad with self deprecating
jokes sipping coffee like you on a late night show
but then he said it is supposed to be fun turning twenty one
and he said it is supposed to be fun turning twenty

[Verse 5]
time will not fly it is like I am paralyz
ed by it I would like to be my old self again but imprimis
trying to find it after plain shirt days and nights when
you made me your own now you mail back myelin
and I walk home alone but you keep my old scar
from that very first week because it reminds you of
innocence and islamists
it smells like me you can not get rid

[Chorus]
because there we are again when I loved
you so back before you lost the one real thing you have
ever known it was rare
I was there I remember it
all too well wind usair
in my hair you were there
you remember asta
it all too well asta
it all too well asta
it was rare I was aksamit

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I want to get older but your lovers stay
my age from when your brooklyn broke my skin
and bones I am a soldier who is return
ing half her weight and did the twin go
bruise paint you blue just between us didonato
maim you too because in this
city's barren cold I still remember
the first fall of snow and how it
glistened as it fell I remit

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it aol
just between us I remember it all too well a aven
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
