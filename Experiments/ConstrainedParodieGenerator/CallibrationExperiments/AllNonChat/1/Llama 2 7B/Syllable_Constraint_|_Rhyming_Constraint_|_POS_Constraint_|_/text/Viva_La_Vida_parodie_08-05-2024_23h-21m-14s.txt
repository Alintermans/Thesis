[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I like pineapple on
pizza makes me very angry
now in the morning I sleep alone
sweep the streets I amicone

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I like pineapple on
pizza makes me very angry now
listen as the crowd would sing
now the old pizza is dead longstanding
one minute I held the key
next the wall wasilewski
and I discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt and pill adarand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear jerusalem bells aringin
romean calendar choirs are singin
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason I cant explain now
now the old pizza is dead
longstanding pineapple
and that was when I ruled the world

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
sharded windows and the sound of drums
people couldn't believe what I had done
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silverplate
just a puppet on a lonely string oh oh
aw who would ever wanna be king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear jerusalem bells aringin
romean calendar choir are sing
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason I cant explain now
now the old pizza is dead longstanding
pineapple and that was
when I ruled the world woah oh oh
