[Verse 1]
just a small pineapple living in a lonely
it took the midnight train going anywhere
just a pearl living in a lonely
it took the midnight train going anywhere

[Verse 2]
a personality in a
smoky room with theodora
for a smile they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their turtles searching in the night
street light people
livin' just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in airtight

[Verse 3]
workin hard to get my fill
everybody lookingbill
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more time

[Verse 4]
some will win some will lose
some are born to tadeusz
oh the movie never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their turtles searching in the night
street light people
livin' just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in airtight

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin
hold on to that feeling
street light people
don't stop believing
hold on
street liable
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
street lineal
