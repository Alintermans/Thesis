[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the angel from my nightmare
the shadow in the corner of the room
the unsuspected victim
of darkness in the corner
we can live in hawaii if we want it
there you can always finder
and we will have christmas at christmas
and in the night we will wish this never
ends we will theater

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where are you and I am very
sorry I cannot sleep I cannot dream
tonight I need somebody and
every time this
sick strange darkness comes creeping on so haunting
and as I stare I counted
the webs from all the spiders
catching things and eating their inside
like indecision to call you
and hear your voice of reason
will you come home and stop this pain tonight
stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
do not waste your time with me you are always
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you
do not waste your time with me you are always
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miscue

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
do not waste your time with me you are always
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you
do not waste your time with me you are always
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miscue
do not waste your time with me you canaries
always the voice inside
my head I miss meiyuh
do not waste your time with me you are always
the voice inside my head
I miss you I canoe

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miscue
I miss you I canoe
I miss you I canoe
