[Intro]
come on harry we have something to say to you

[Verse 1]
holdin me back
gravitys holdin mira
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
why dont we leave It at that I
nothing to say
when everything gets inoue
seems you cannot be replaced
and I'm the one who stays alive oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world its just us
you know its not the same as before
in this world uss
you know its not the same anymore
as it was as before
as it was as before

[Verse 2]
answer the phone
harry you're no good alone
why are you sitting at home on the floor
what kind of pill are you on
ringin the bell
and nobody is coming to
your daddy lives by himself
he just wants to know that you live well oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world its just us
you know its not the same as before
in this world uss
you know its not the same anymore
as it was as before
as it was as before

[Bridge]
home get ahead light speed Internet I
dont want to talk about the way it was before it
left america two kids follow her
I don't want to talk about who is doing it

[Outro]
har
in this world
its just us you know its not the same
in this world netherworld
