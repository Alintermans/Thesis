a one night stand turned a two night stand it
was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and after
he found out now she feels deserted and used
because he left so what he did it first to
her too now how am I supposed to tell theola
this girl that we're through it's hard to find theodorou
words I'm aloof nervous and sue don't want this to hurt
but what you deserve is the truth don't take it personal ikea
just can't say this in person to you so I revert to the stud
io like hole in the wall miniskirt
don't have to be reserved in a booth I just feel
like the person who I'm turning into's irreversible
I preyed on you like it's church atalanta
now that I got you I donapria
don't want you took advantage in
my thirst to pursue why do I do this dirt that
I do get on my soapbox and preach I
just feel like the person
who I'm turning into's irreversible
I preyed on you like it's church atalanta now that I got
you
