He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar trying to\nlike a pineapple on a\npizza I'm sorry I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain the truth and my lies now\nare falling like the rain so let\nthe river run river run river calumet\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI've been a liar trying to I'm sorry\nI don't want to admit to\nsomething if all it's gonna cause is\npain the truth and my lies now are falling wellesley\nso let the river run river run calumny\nso let the river run river run cal\nor river run so let the river run river run cal\nor river run so let the river run river run cal or river\nrun so let the river run\nriver run river run river run river run river\nrun river run river run river run river\nrun river run river run river run river run if\nall it's gonna cause is\npain the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run river run river run river run cal\nor river run so let the river run ha\nif all it's gonna\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar trying to\nlike a pineapple on a\npizza I'm sorry I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain the truth and my lies now\nare falling like the rain so let\nthe river run river run river calumet\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one night stand turned a two night stand it\nwas come sunlight scram now we hug tight and after\nhe found out now she feels deserted and used\nbecause he left so what he did it first to\nher too now how am I supposed to tell theola\nthis girl that we're through it's hard to find theodorou\nwords I'm aloof nervous and sue don't want this to hurt\nbut what you deserve is the truth don't take it personal ikea\njust can't say this in person to you so I revert to the stud\nio like hole in the wall miniskirt\ndon't have to be reserved in a booth I just feel\nlike the person who I'm turning into's irreversible\nI preyed on you like it's church atalanta\nnow that I got you I donapria\ndon't want you took advantage in\nmy thirst to pursue why do I do this dirt that\nI do get on my soapbox and preach I\njust feel like the person\nwho I'm turning into's irreversible\nI preyed on you like it's church atalanta now that I got\nyou\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's hello my name\nis mar\ncus\nhello mar\ncus river aspartame\ncall me hello call me avelar\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the bridesmaid never the bride he\ny I can keep my lies straight butchery\nI made you terminate my baby this love triangle\nleft us in a wreck tangled what else can I say it\nwas fun for a while bet I really would\nhave loved your smile didn't re\nally wanna abort but ecevit\nfuck it what's one more lie tell our unborn child\nI don't want to admit to something if\nall it's gonna cause is pain the truth\nand my lies now are falling like the rain so\nlet the river run river run river run\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar trying to\nlike a pineapple on a\npizza I'm sorry I don't want to admit to something\nif all it'sgonn\naven\n\nyou wrote a parody about why you\ndon't want\n\nto admit to something if all\nit's gonna cause is pain the truth and mcnicol\n",
