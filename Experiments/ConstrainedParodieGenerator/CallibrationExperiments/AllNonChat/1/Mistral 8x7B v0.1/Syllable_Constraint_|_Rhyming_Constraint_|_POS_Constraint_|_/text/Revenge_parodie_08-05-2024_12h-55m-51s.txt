[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to forget that sin
of putting pineapple on pizza
you agreeis it a blunder
you agree

[Verse]
I've tasted two tastes for us me
can't pretend that it was tasty leaving meineke
oh man what a dish the things I see
if I could turn back time would I undo it
some serve pineapple on pizza
and you'd have thought that I would say no way and pass it off
well broken tastebuds ache so fastly
and I don't wanna taste it again so in the bin it
ll rot I've tasted two tastes me
can't pretend that it was tasty leaving meinecke
oh man what a dish the things I see
if I could turn back time would I undo it
some serve pineapple onoda
and you'd have thought that I would say no way and pass it off
well broken tastebuds ache solemnly
and I don't wanna taste it again so in the bin it

[Chorus]
in the bin it'll
rot rot rotten skull
in the bin it'll rotrott
in the bin weevil
in the bin it'll roset
in the bin it'll

[Outro]
in the bin it'll
rot rot rotten soulful
is my grief your pleasure
is all of my grief your treasure
enjoy
