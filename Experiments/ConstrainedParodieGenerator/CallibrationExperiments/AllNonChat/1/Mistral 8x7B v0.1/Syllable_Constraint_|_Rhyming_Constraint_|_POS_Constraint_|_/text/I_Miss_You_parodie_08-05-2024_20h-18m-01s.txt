[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on pizza's bane emer cul
the monster in the fridge at nightmares calls
a savory creation
ruined by this sweet intrud
we can't pretend like it's just fine dining
for our taste buds twisted
halloween's delight on pizza night
we'll wish this never starts again no more
we'll wish this nevermore

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where did it come from and I'm so
disgusted at this sight tonight I can
barely look at it and always
these conflicting flav
ors make me so confused each time please go aw
ay from my pizza pie and
let me eat in peace and not
see this monstrous creation ever
more tonight stop this pain tonight
stop this pain tonight before
my pizza's ruined evermore orphan
ed by the taste un

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add it to my plate you're already
the abomination
I despise it I desp
don't add it to my plate you're already
the abomination
I despise it I desp

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add it to my plate you're already
the abomination
I despise it I desp
don't add it to my plate you're already
the abomination
I despise it I desp
don't add it to my plate you're already
the abomination
I despise it I desp
don't add it to my plate you're already
the abomination
I despise it I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
