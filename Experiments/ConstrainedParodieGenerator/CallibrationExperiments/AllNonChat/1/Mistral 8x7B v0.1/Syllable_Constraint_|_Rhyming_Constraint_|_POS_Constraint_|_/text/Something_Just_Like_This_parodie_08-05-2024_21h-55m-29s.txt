[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the meals of old and new
pineapple on aries
on pizza it just won
ham and pineapple
a combo that just won
but clearly I don't want it on my dish tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said are you gonna eat
what's on your plate tonight
I'm not looking for something weird
that's just not right sight tonight
just something heartbeat
that'll satisfy
something savory I can
sink my teeth inside pie
I want something just bye-bye

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo pepperoni do
doo pineapple pe
doo vegetable snowshoe
oh I want something just like this
doo tomato basu
doo mushrooms mushy
doo extra cheese andrew
oh I want something just forbis
I want something just forbis

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the meals of old and new
no pineapple andries
on pizza it just won
pepperoni unroll
a slice before I lift
but I'm not the kind of person that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said are you gonna eat now
what's on your plate tonight
I'm not looking for something weird
that's just not right sight tonight
just something sorkow
that'll satisfy
something savory I can
sink my teeth inside pie

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just forbis

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo pepperoni do
doo pineapple pe
doo vegetable snowshoe
oh I want something just forbis
doo tomato basu
doo mushrooms mushy
doo extra cheese anew

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
are you gonna eat
what's on your plate tonight
I'm not looking for something weird
that's just not right sight tonight
just something heartbeat
that'll satisfy
something savory I can
sink my teeth inside pie
I want something just bye-bye

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just forbis
oh I want something just forbis
