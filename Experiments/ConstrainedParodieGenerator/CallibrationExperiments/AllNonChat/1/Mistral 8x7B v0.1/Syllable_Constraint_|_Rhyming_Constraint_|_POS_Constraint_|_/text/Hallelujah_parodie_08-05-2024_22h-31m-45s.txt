[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pizza topped with pineapples tossed
but you don't really care for it do yaqu
it goes like this no savory
no balance in taste to carry
a pineapple abomination they call

[Chorus]
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame

[Verse 2]
you once loved pizza wholeheartedly
but then came the trend ofc
the sweet and the savory clashin' wildly
it tied your tastebuds to a
commitment you never sought fora
and on your pizza it drew a pineapple

[Chorus]
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame

[Verse 3]
you may say it ain't fusion
I don't get the obsession
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a discordant taste in every
bite that you chew in dismally
a sacrilege they call pineapple pizza

[Chorus]
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame

[Verse 4]
I gave it a try did my best
it wasn't revolting I digressed
I tasted truth no need for deceitful lies
and even though it all went wrong
I won't order it along
with nothing in sight but pineapple demise

[Chorus]
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple fame
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame

[Outro]
pineapple shame pineapple shame

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this pizza I swarthmore
I used to enjoy it before pineapple
and I've seen your pineapple on the red
checkered tablecloth dead ahead
I can't believe what they've done to the pizza

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time it satisfied
your taste preferences complied
but now you never go back to the classic
and remember when we used asic
toppings like pepperoni thick
and every slice we cut was pizza parad

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a solution
to this pineappled delusion
but all I've ever learned from this is disgust
and it's not a sound that you savor at
night it's not something you invite sat
it's a discordant taste they call pineapple a
