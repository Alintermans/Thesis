[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
my taste buds scream in horror
wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn justa

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a funny letter
to warn my tongue what to do
do you taste my dishes none
or do you shun what I begun
when you said you'd take ahonen
was my pizza even on
I knew when I asked you to not ruin myhren
you'd do the opposite of what youman
and I'd end up screamin' more obscenethan I ever hadrian
don't say it's just a phase
you clearly weren't aware
that you made me gastronomically impaired so
if you really wanna know ho

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on apizza I'm in despair
wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't
true it's just not fairrefrain refrain refrain refraineer ailment
it's just not fair refrain refr

[Verse 2]
you call me up for pizza again
drownin' in your pineapples plea sure
you nauseated me to death but I ate
with you just to keep you near me refrain
I cannot relate to you
I cannot relate to you no
for I'd never treat me this way
it makes my stomach aka

[Verse 3]
and I don't speak ill of pineapple on the inter
net never told anyone anything
bad cause that shit's embarrassin' you were my en
dless source of dismay and all that you doffing
is make me want to throw it all away
so don't waste the time I donning
and don't try to make me sway refrain refrain refrain refr
ain I could talk about every time that you showed
up on time but I'd have an empty line cause you never
paid any mind to my health concerns coed

[Outro]

always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone yeah fuck you
ah
