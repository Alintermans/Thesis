[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottle in hand looking for that slice oh
it started out as a joke how did it end up like this
pineapple on a pizza ain't no luscious
now I'm staring at this monstrosity in shock
while my taste buds cry out for something proper to
masticate on instead of sitting here contempl
ating this tragedy

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're slicing it up now
with canned pineapple chunks
take it back
it's ruining the experience for
my unsullied taste

[Chorus]
jealousy turning pizza lovers to
vomiting in disgust at
pineapple toppped tomcat
but it's just the price we pay
posterity willapa
shaming this travesty kat
cause I'm mr can

[Guitar Solo]
