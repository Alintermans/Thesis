[Intro]

crazy or just insanity taking over cul
look at this monstrosity on display will
it stay or go away today israel
easy to add sweet fruit high in vitamin c but low in
nutritional value on a savory dish like this oneall

[Verse 1]
papa just ruined a
pizza topped it with pineapple shameful act indeed it
clashes with the taste of sauce
and cheese it spoils the harmony of flav
papa shouldn't have done this to pizza
if I order again tomorrow it won
t have pineapple on it that's for sure carry on eat

[Verse 2]
too late my meal is served
tainted with sweetness I cannot hide my disgust the
toppings mix like oil and water leaving
a bitter taste in my mouth goodbye pizza

strosity let me enjoy my pizza in

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a golden slice of pizza heaven
scaramouche scaramouche are you adding pineapple
thunderbolts of anger striking through me lightning fast it
pales in comparison to this sacrilege galileo galileo oh how disappointing figel
ooh I just want a normal pizza sanskrit
what were you thinking adding pineapple it
sacrifices the integrity it
sacrifices the authenticity will
you let me have my pizza backpedal
never never never never never addle
mamma mia let me have my pizza nowell
let me taste the glory beetle
juice has no place on my marshall
now I'm just a poor boy who wants his pizza back
no pineapple nocturnal
spare me this monstrosity restore my faith take it back rightful
place give me back my pizza in its original state forfeit

[Verse 4]
so you think you can ruin my pizza do you
well think again I won't stand for itochu
just gotta get away from this disaster
so I can enjoy my pizza the way it was meant

[Outro]
oh
nothing compares
to a pizza with no pineapple on it
nothing really matters
nothing really matters tollett
all that really matters
