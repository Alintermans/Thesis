[Verse 1]
I walked through the door of the pizzeria
and saw a pizza covered in pineapple
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I dropped the pizza on theatrical

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet smelling pineapple and my wide eyes gaz
we are eating pineapple pizza getting
wanting to vomit upstate autumn leaves falling
down like pieces into place and omaha

[Pre-Chorus]
and I can picture myself
after all these days having
and I might be ok but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in that little town
you almost threw up the pizza because you were looking at
pineapple in your hair you
remember it all too well too

[Verse 3]
photo album on the counter you order pizza with
pineapple you used to be such a little person with aerosmith
and your mother is telling stories about you eating a
cheese pizza you told me about your past thinking your
future was pineapple and you were tossing me theodore
rhetoric key chain on the ground we were always
throwing up and I was thinking on the drive down o
any time now he's going to say it's love you never
called it what it was until we
wanted to vomit and were buried checking
the pulse and coming back swe
and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
but all I felt was pain and you held my vomiting

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we are dancing around the kitchen in theology
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
sacred prayer and we swe
to remember it all too well yeah

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I puked for too
but maybe this pizza was a master
piece until you threw
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to throw up on me so cas
ally cruel in the name of being honest I'm a vom
it covered piece of paper lying here cause I
remember it all all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I am in a new
hell every time you puke on my mind
you said that if we had been closer in taste maybe it would have been
fine and that made me want to
the idea you had of me who was she
a never throwing up ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
not throwing up in a party bath
some actress asking me what happened you
that's what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self deprecating
jokes sipping coffee like you're on a latenight
show but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to
come and he said it's supposed to be fun vomiting on

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after pineapple days and night when you made me your
own now you throw up my things and I gochenour
but you keep my old garbage from that very first
week cause it reminds you of innocence and it looks
like vomit you chavalit
because you remember it all too

[Chorus]
cause there we are again when I loved you
back before you lost the one real pizza you've ever
known it was rare I was

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
and did the pineapple bruise paint you blue
