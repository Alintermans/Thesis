[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me somethin
are you happy in this modern world
or do you need more
is there somethin else you ardmore

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
im falling
in all the good times I find myself longing
for change
and in the bad times I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
arent you tired tryna fill that void
or do you need more
aint it hard keeping it so hard gillmore

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
im falling
in all the good times I find myself wanting
for change
and in the bad times I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
im off the deep end watch as I drive in
ill never meet the ground
crash through the surface here they cant hurt us were
far from the shallow now post

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the shallow in the shall
in the shallow la la la la low
in the shallow in the shall
were far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
im off the deep end watch as I drive in
ill never meet the ground
crash through the surface here they cant hurt us were
far from the shallow now post

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the shallow in the
in the shallow la lauricella
in the shall lawfully
were far from the shallow now
