[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a big debate
that people argue and complicate
but you don't really care for vegetables do

pineapple pizza pineapple
pineapple pizza pineal

[Verse 2]
your faith is strong but you need proof that
pineapple is good butterfat
you saw her eating pineapple on the roof
her beauty in the moonlight bew
she tied you to a kitchen chair she
broke your throne and she cut your hair and from your

[Chorus]
pineapple pizza pineapple

but if I did well really what is it to
there's a blaze of light behind every
word it doesn't matter whatley

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this room I metaphor
I walk this floor alone before I knew you
and I've seen you eat that pineapple arch
pizza is not a victory

what's really going undergo
but now you never show it to me do you

the holy pizza wasiyu

was how to argue with someone who wants you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who selenite
it's a cold and it's a broken pineapple pie
