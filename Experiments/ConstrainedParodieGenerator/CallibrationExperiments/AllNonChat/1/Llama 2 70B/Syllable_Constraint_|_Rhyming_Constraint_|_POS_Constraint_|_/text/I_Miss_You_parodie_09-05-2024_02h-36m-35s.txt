[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you my pizza

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pizza from farberware
the shadow at the dinner table of
the expected vegetables
that bring the darkness to the
valley we can live like jack and sally if
where you can always findlay
and we'll have christmas on summer and
in the night we'll wish this pizza never
ends we'll wish thereafter

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you my pizza
I miss you myrilla

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where are you and my pizza so
sorry I cannot sleep I cannot eat
tonight I need somebody and
always this sweet strange
comes creeping on so haunting every time
and as I'm stare I counted
the seeds from the tomatoes
catching things and cutting them half I
like decision to call you and
hear your voice of tomato
will you come home and bring this parakeet
will you uncomplete

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head
I miss you my pizza
don't waste your time on me you aretsky
the voice inside my head
I miss you myrilla

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head
I miss you my pizza
don't waste your time on me you' already
the voice inside my head
I miss you myrilla
don't waste your time on me you aretsky
the voice inside my head
I miss you mejia
don't waste your time on me you' already
the voice inside my head
I miss you meola

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you my pizza
I miss you myrilla
I miss you mejia
I miss you meola
