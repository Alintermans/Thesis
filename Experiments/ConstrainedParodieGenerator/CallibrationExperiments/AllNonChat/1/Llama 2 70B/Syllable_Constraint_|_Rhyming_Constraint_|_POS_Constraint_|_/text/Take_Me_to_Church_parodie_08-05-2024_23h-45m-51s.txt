[Verse 1]
I order a pizza
it gives me happiness because it
tastes deliciousnesses albeit
I want pineapple added to
the rest of the ingredients
its being a common
a fruit that belongs on astringents
all other elements
I should add more of this fruit sooner
if the heavens ever did speak
I think they would say this is weeker
every sunday I'm getting more
addicted to theodore
we were born curious ander
are you saying I shouldn

[Pre-Chorus]
no master
amen mencer

[Chorus]
add pineapple
I'm ordering like a dog at the shrine of your
I'll tell you what foods I want and you can order
adding pineapple to death
oh good delivery takeover
add pineal
I'm ordering like a dog at the dittemore
I'll tell you what items I want and uglier
adding pineapple to death
oh good delivery takeover

[Verse 2]
if my ordered pizza isn't good
I order another
to see if it tastes betterer
my loved one demands something
tasting deliciousnessessessess
thats a tasty looking pizza
what you got inamura
I've got a lot of starving
I wish the pizza oncoming
this is hungry work beatrice
this is hungry work

[Chorus]
add pineapple
I'm ordering like a dog at the shrine of your
I'll tell you what foods I want and you can order
adding pineapple to death
oh good delivery takeover
add pineal
I'm ordering like a dog at the dinosa
I'll tell you what items I want and uglier
adding pineapple to death
oh good delivery takeover

[Bridge]
no masters or kings when the pizza beginsas
there is no sweeter innocence than our general
in the madness and soil of that nice restaurant
only then I can eat human only enimont

[Pre-Chorus]
no master men
amen amen

[Chorus]
add pineapple
I'm ordering like a dog at the shrine of your
I'll tell you what foods I want and you can order
adding pineapple to death
oh good delivery takeover
add pineal
I'm ordering like a dog at the dittemore
I'll tell you what items I want and uglier
adding pineapple to death
oh good delivery takeover
