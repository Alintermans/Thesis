[Intro]
don't put pineapple on my pizza please don

[Verse 1]
pineapple is
pineapple is notices
I want you to put down the hammer of your
why don't we let it at that
nothing to say
when everything isadore
seems you can not be replaced
and I am the one who will say so no

[Chorus]
in this world its just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world uss
you know its not the same asmaras
in this world usages
you know its not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the phone
harry you are aiton
why are you waiting at home in the room
what kind of pills are you on
ringlets the bell
and nobodys is coming to
your daddy lives by himself
he just wants to go that you were well no more

[Chorus]
in this world its just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world uss
you know its not the same asmaras
in this world usages
you know its not the same

[Bridge]
go home get ahead light speed internet
I do not want to talk about the way that it was
lease america two kids follow her
I do not want to talk about who is doing it

[Outro]
aye
in this world
you know its not the same netherworld
in this world underworld
