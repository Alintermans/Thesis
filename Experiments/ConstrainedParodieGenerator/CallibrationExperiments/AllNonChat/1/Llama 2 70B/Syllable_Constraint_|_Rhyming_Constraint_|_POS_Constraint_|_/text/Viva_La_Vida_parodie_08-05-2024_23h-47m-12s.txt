[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I am a pineapple
I sit on top of a pizza
now in the evening I sleep alone
I sweep the streets I used to

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I am a pineapple
I sit on top of a pizza pie
listen as the crowd would sing
now the old king is dead long live the king
one minute I held the key
next the walls were closed iny
and I discovered that my castle stood
upon pillars of salt and sugar inwood

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my missionaries in a
foreign field for some reason ikea
explain once you're gone there was never
never an honest word and
that was when I ruled the
world I hear jerusalem bell

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldn't believe what I'd become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silverplate
just a puppet on a lonely string aw ho
would ever wanna be king I hear

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells are ringing roman
cavalry choirs are singing be mine
missionaries in a foreign
field for some reason I cancellation
I know saint peter won't call may
name never an honest word but that was
when I ruled the world oh
