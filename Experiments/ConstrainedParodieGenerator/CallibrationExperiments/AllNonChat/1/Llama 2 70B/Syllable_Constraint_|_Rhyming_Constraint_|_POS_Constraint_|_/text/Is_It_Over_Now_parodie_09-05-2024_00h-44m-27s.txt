[Intro]
is it is it is it is it is it

[Verse 1]
once the taste had tested I
with the skin of the bernabei
I tasted all alone I
you still wont goa

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your burger and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
you dream of my food before it had called you alexander
you search in every maidens back for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when she tasted down on your
was it over when he unburgered your
oh come here I whispered in your
in your sleep as you passed out baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it is it is it

[Verse 2]
when you lost hunger control
red bread white cassero
blue dinner on aureole
your new favorite is

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you
there were flashy lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my days out of sight
only rumours about my burgers
and my whitewater
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall something
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I have been wanting but

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later oh
if she's got blue eyes I will surmise that you will probably date herro
you dream of my food before it called you a lying trabucco
you search in every models back for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when she tasted down on your
was it over when he unburgered your
oh come here I whispered in your
in your sleep as you passed out baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
uh u
is it is it is it
uh u
is it islet

[Bridge]
think I didn't see you
there were flashy lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my days out of sight
only rumours about my burgers
and my whitewater
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall something
just to see you come running laughing
and say the one thing I have been wanting but

[Outro]
flashy lights oh lord oh
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later oh
I was hoping you'd be thereand saying
the one thing oh lord oh lord
was it was it washboard
washko
was it was it was it was it was it was it
