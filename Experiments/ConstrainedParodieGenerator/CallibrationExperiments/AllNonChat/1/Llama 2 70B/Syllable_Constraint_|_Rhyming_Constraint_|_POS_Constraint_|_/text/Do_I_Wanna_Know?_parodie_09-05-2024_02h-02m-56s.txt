[Verse 1]

do you ever get that fear that you can't remove the
that sticks around like pineapple in your
are there some pineapple up your
have you no idea that you're in deep
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
how many pineapple can you
'cause there's this pizza I
that makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
until I fall asleep spillin' pineapple on

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this feeling goes both ways
sad to see you go was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
baby we both know that the pizza was mainly
for saying things that you can't say tom ricochet

[Chorus]

it's just I'm constantly on the cups of trying to eat you
but I don't know if you feel the same as I do
but we could eat together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]

sad to see you go was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
baby we both know that the pizza was mainly
for saying things that you can't say tom ricochet
