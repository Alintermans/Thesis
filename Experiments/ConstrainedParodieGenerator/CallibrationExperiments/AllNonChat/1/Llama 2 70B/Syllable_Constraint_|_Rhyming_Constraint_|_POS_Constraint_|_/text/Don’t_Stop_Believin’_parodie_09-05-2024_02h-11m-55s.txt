world with pineapple pizza haters she took
the midnight train going anywhere just a from
a normal pizza lover born and raised in

[Pre-Chorus]

up and down the pizza shop
their mouth searching in the pizza

eating just to find emotion
hiding somewhere inkatha

working hard to get my fill
everybody wants a kill
buying anything to roll the dice

[Pre-Chorus]

up and down the pizza shop
their mouth searching in the pizza
people people
eating just to find emotion
hiding somewhere inkatha
