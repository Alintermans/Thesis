[Verse 1]
pineapple on pizza is
nothing to worry about to me alive
for a sensation I
realized quickly when I knew I should stop
that the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
for whatever that means

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry whenever I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I i am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I yell from the top of my lung
what is going

[Chorus]
and I say hey ey e
heatedly
I said hey what is going on
and I say heatherly
heavily
I said hey what is going on

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]

oh my god do I heat
I eat every

and I pray

I pray every single day
for evolution

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry whenever I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I i am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I yell from the top of my lung
what is going

[Chorus]
and I say hey ey e
