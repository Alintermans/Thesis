[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I made a pineapple pie
that was so delicious
people came overfly
to taste my creation
spongebob and his
friend patrick from the sea
and clearly I don't see myself upon that list

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she asked me where d'you want to
go how much you want to
risk I'm not looking for someone
with some super human gift
some supernova
some fairytale kiss
just something I can turn to
somebody I can miss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
this I want something
just like this I want I
want something just like this I want
something just like this I
want something just like
this I want something just
like this I want something inmont
this I want something just like

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I read recipe books old
the traditions and the
myths achilles withhold
hercules and his gift
spiderman control bat
man with his fists andclear
ly I don't see myself upon that list

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she asked me where d'you want to
go how much you want to
risk I'm not looking for someone
with some super human gift
some supernova
some fairytale kiss
just something I can turn to
somebody I willis

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]

go how much you want to
risk I'm not looking for someone
with some super human gift

some fairytale kiss
just something I can turn to

I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
