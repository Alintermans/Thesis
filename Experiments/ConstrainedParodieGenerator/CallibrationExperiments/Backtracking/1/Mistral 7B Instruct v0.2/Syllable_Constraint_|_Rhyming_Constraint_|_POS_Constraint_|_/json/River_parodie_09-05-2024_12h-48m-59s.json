He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on\nall my sins need cleansing water felt it washing over\nwell little one I don't want\nif all it's gonna cause a commotion inmont\nthe truth and my lies now\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe brings it home sliced on his pizza plate to\njack daniels and tomato sauce\nbut she hates it with a passion so\nit's a battle in the kitchen heated andrew\nhe insists it complements the dish butala\nshe's determined to set this debate al\nand claims it's an affront to italian cuisine so raw\nnow they're on a collision course like a runaway carnival ride\nit's a standoff in the pan\nand she's got a can of pineapple chunks ready to brand\n'cause she's devoted to tradition andolina\nand you don't mix fruit with savory dishes even\nI know she's cooking up a plan\nand I'm the unwitting pawn in her culinary\n'cause she's a purist and I'm a fan of the sweet and the savory\nbut I should've listened to mycology\nafter the first bite but tonight I am\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on\nall my sins need cleansing water felt it washing over\nwell little one I don't want\nif all it's gonna cause a commotion inmont\nthe truth and my lies now\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\none slice led to two and then to three nights\nit was love at first bite but now it's sour and\nhe confessed his love for the tropical fruit\nbut she felt betrayed and left in the lurch and\nnow how am I supposed to tell this girl beforehand\nit's tough to find the words I'm awkward and maryland\ndon't want this to hurt but what she deserves is the truth\nso I retreat to the kitchen like a secret hideout room underfund\nI just feel like the person I'm becoming is irreversible\nI justified my actions maryruth\nand now that I've tasted her disapproval I don\nt want her anymore I've moved on to someone newfoundland\nwhy do I do this thing that I do ohland\nget on my soapbox and preach meadowland\npineapples belong on hogeland\n'cause now with her in the oven I can't bring her\ninto this world should've known I should've\nused protection in the\nfridge before I bit into your for orland\nfruit salad disasterland oh my godlandlandlandlandland\ncall\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's emmanuel\nmy name\ncul\nlinary\nrun it's called pineapple\nrun pineapple runrun italy\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the adventurous one in the\nkitchen trying out exotic newsy\nfruit on my pizza but now I see the error of ways\nspeeds at a high rate in my haste unable to pause\nthat's why I may have acted in a has\nI can't keep my choices\nbut I made her raise our chickasaws\nthis flavor war left us in a wreck twisted and\nwhat else can I say it was fun for a while\nbut I really would've loved her style\ndidn't really wanna terminate our\nbaby but what's one more lie to tell our\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on\nall bad choices\ncomecon\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nthe truth to\n\nif all it's gonna cause a comm\npain so let the river run pineapple islam\n",
