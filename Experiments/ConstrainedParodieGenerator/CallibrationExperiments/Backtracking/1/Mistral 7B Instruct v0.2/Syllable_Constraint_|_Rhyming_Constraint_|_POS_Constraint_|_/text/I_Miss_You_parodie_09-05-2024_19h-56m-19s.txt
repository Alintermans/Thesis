[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the intruder underwear
the irritant on my pizza pie with
the unexpected flavor
of sweetness in the valley
we can live without pepperoni if we
choose where you cangialosi
and we'll have summer in december
and in the night we'll argue this never
ends this debate weaker

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the pineapple gone and I
apologetically say so sorry
I cant eat or even dream now
this controversial
flavor comes encroaching on me every
time I see a pizza round
and as I ponder I've cont
the sticky strings from all the fliescatch
ing things and eating their delight
like the addition of this
will you come back and put anastasi
a stop toshiki

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my taste
don't top your pie with
I pine for peace atopI pine forcibly
the voice inside my taste
I pine for peace beckwith

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my taste
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atopI pine forcibly
the voice inside my taste
I pine for peace bebop
please note that this parody ishiba ve
ry loosel aftertaste
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atopI pine forcibly
the voice inside my taste
I pine for peace eavesdrop

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
