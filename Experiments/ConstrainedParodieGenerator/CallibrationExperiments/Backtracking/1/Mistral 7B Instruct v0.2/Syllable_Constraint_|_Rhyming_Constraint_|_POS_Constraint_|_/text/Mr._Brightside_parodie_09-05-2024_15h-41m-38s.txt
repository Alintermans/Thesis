[Verse]
comin' out of my kitchen and I've been doin' just
gotta hide in the corner because pineapple
started out on the piecrustbut ended up on the dish
it was only a topping it was only fish
now I'm watchin' them eat and my appetite's
gone while they're savourin' their slices and laughin
now they're goin' for seconds and my stomach is
heaving and it's all in

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's bite into his slice
he savours underprice
let me go
'cause I just can't bear it feeling so nice
and taking the choice

[Chorus]
jealousy ruins the harmony of
swimmin' through sick savoury
chokin' on your tomasi
but it's just the price I pay
pineapple is callin' of
open up mycology
'cause I'm mr bitter

[Guitar Solo]
