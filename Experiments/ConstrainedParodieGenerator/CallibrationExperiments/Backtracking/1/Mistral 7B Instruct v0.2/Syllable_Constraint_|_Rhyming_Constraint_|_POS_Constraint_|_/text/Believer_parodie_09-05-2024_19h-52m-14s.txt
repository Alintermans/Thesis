[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about a topic quite absurd
pineapple on pizza's lure is
ruining meals with its allure
ruining meals with its allure

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you judge me for my taste preference we
have the right to our
pizza toppings that we choose to be
our pizza topsy-turvy

[Pre-Chorus]
it's been a longstanding debate
breaking friendships and family ties
some say it's sweet and savory
others claim it's just a disguise trying to deceive
finding common ground in our
shared love for pizzas we create
singing our defense forger
standing up for our beloved

[Chorus]
pineapplepie you made me a belie
ver beliverbeliev
pineapplepie you divide and unite
beliver bel verville
pineapplepie oh let the controversy rain
our love for pizza it came from
pineapplepie you made me a belie
ver beliverbeliev

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to those who disagree
pineapple devoured
brings us together in harmony this
pineapple power unisys

[Pre-Chorus]
we were divided in the
pizza party scene butchery
learning to appreciate the
variety of flavors we
embrace our differences and grow together
finding common ground in our new pizza creations we
create a new

[Chorus]
pineapplepie you made me a belie
ver beliverbeliev
pineapplepie you divide and unite
beliver bel verville
pineapplepie oh let the controversy rain
our love for pizza it came from
pineapplepie you made me a belie
ver beliverbeliev

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the power of the oven and the
pineapple's sweet surprise in
every bite that we take
our love for kittiwake

[Pre-Chorus]
and we've come together in acceptance and delight
finding common ground in our new pizza creations we
create a new

[Chorus]
pineapplepie you made me a belie
ver beliverbeliev
pineapplepie you divide and unite
beliver bel verville
pineapplepie oh let the controversy rain
our love for pizza it came from
