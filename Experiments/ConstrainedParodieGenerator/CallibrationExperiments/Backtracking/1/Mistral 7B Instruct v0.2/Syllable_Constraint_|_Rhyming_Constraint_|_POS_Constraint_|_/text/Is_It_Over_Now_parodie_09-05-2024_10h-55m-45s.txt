[Intro]
is it pineapple on a pizza night

[Verse 1]
once the meal was maderight
with the taste of savory bit
but you insisted nolet
pineapple just won

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand pizzas later tonight
you crave my pepperoni but pineapple ruins the sight
you dream of my cheese before it called you a losing trait night
you search in every menu for something more appetizing

[Chorus]
was it over when you loaded it with pine
was it over when you ordered it online
I whispered in your ear as you
passed out in your pineapple induced
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it pineapple on

[Verse 2]
when you lost control of taste
red tomato replaced
green pineapple on disgraced
our favorite dish

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the pineapple chunks
at least I had the dignity
to keep my pizza in the
only rumors about my cheese and
my whispered moorland
oh lord I think about order
off of very spicy things
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand takeout orders later oh
if it's got pineapple on it ill surmise that you'll probably disbro
you dream of my pepperoni before it called you akao
you search in every restaurant for something more flavorful

[Chorus]
was it over when you loaded it with pine
was it over when you ordered it online
I whispered in your ear as you
passed out in your pineapple induced
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it pineapple on
piglet
is it pierron

[Bridge]
did I not notice pine
the pineapple chunks
at least I had the dignity
to keep my pizza in the
only rumors about my cheese and
my whispered moorland
oh lord I think about order
off of very delicious
just to see you come running piglet
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Outro]
pineapple lights piglet
oh lord piglet piglet piglet piglet piglet babysit
let's fast forward to a thousand wasted
calories later piglet
pineapple lights piglet
I was
hoping you'd be there piglet piglet piglet pig
