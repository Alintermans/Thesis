[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it wasn't right somehow
a slice of pineapple on your pizza pie
now ruins the taste for me every brow

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet disposition and my disgusted gaze
we argue in the car while heading away
leaves of pineapple falling down like pieces in
disarray I can picture it after days

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
pineapple on pizzas not
and I might pretend to be okay but I'm not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little pizza
you almost spoiled it all because of your obsession with pine
apple on top wind inmy
hair I remember it all too

[Verse 3]
pineapple album on the counter your cheeks were turning
red you used to be a pizza perfectionist in a twin sizing
bed and your mother's telling stories about your past pizza
creations you told me about your past pizza dreams
and you were tossing me the pepperoni knife joachim
keychain on the ground we were always running from
town and I was thinking on the drive down any time
now he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it
was til we were dead and gone and
buried check the pizza and come back swearing
it's the same after three months
and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
but all I felt was disappointment and you heldring

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
ath sacrifice forswear
to remember it all too well yeah

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this relationship was a
masterpiece til the
pineapple ruined it
running scared I was there irem
ember it all too well pineapple on my pizza I was
there down the stairs I was there I was there sacred prayer I was
there I was there it was rare you remember it
all too well pineapple on the

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you ruin my pizza
you said if we had agreed on the pizza toppings maybe it would
have been fine and that made me
want to die the idea you had of me
a never picky pizza lover whose choices reflected on you who
was weeping in a party bathroom
some guest asking me what happened hebrew
that's what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self deprecating
jokes sipping beer like you're on a comedy stage
but then he watched me watch the pizza counter all night willing you
to order something other than pine apple and he said

[Verse 5]
time won't fly I'm like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to refit
my pizza preferences after pineapple filled
days and nights when you made me your own unfulfilled
but you keep my old pepperoni from that first
week it reminds you of satisfaction and it tastes
like me you can't admit
it's gone you remember it all too

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you added pineapple to every
pizza I remember
wind in my hair you were there wind
in my hair you remember
down the stairs you were there
you remember windsor
it was rare I was there
I remember ittner
it was rare you remember sind

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pizza toppings stay
the same from when your pineapple broke mine
taste buds and bones I'm a soldier returning
from the battlefield of pizza choice
and did the pineapple bruise paint you intervoice
just between us did the love
affair maim you too did the love affair
maim me too cause in this city
our pizza choices arey

[Outro]
I love you guys so much just between us I remember
it all too well pineapple on my pizza weiher
