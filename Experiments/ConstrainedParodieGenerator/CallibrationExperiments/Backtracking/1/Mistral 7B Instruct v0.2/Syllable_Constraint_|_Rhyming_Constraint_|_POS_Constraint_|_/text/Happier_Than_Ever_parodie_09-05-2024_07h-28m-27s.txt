[Verse 2]
you insist on adding pineapple
in the middle of our mealtime
scaring us all to death with your flavorful
insensitivity we pineal
we disagree we don't

never came prepared respecting our friends so we shut
them all out for you because we pettigrew

you ruined every dish
always said you were unique mellish

just leave us alone pineapple tone please
ah
goddam
ah
leave us
alone
