[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go ical error
pineapple belongs on aflutter
my tastebuds scream in terror
if the cooks insist on adding
pineapple sliced and grin
it's a culinary fumbling
a gastronom calming
we were meant for savory feasting
not sweet fruit on a pizza base
but in a fruit salad it's embraced
this abomination can't be
could never be myslinski
command me to ban orphaning
remove that pineappled

[Pre-Chorus]
a pity
p ianni

[Chorus]
take me to a
pizza place that's free of pineapple stains on the
floor where I can savor pepperoni and mo
zzarella instead of sac
religious blunder let mexico
be the toma
to I'll surrender take a pizza noisily
topped with veggies and ham instead of pineo
dding I'll adore maniac
lly nibble onions andriano

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the classic
pizza style to me it
sacrosanct pineapple has none
place on a pizza pie I
can't abide by this modern trend
something sweet on a pizza ain
t appealing inhumane
what you got in the kitchen
it's a sacrilege inhuman
a lot of hungry echemende
zenned people out

[Chorus]
take me to a
pizza place that's free of pineapple stains on the
floor where I can savor pepperoni and mo
zzarella instead of sac
religious blunder let mexico
be the toma
to I'll surrender take a pizza noisily
topped with veggies and ham instead of pineo
dding I'll adore maniac
lly nibble onions andriano

[Bridge]
no pineapple allowed whenthe ritual begins
there is no sweeter symphony than our classic dish
in the passion and spice of that delicious scene
only then I am satiated only then myrlene

[Pre-Chorus]
a pity oh
oh akao

[Chorus]
take me to a
pizza place that's free of pineapple stains on the
floor where I can savor pepperoni and mo
zzarella instead of sac
religious blunder let mexico
be the toma
to I'll surrender take a pizza noisily
topped with veggies and ham instead of pineo
dding I'll adore maniac
lly nibble onions andriano
