[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
my taste buds scream in horror
wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn justa

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a funny letter
to warn my tongue what to do
do you taste my dishes none
or do you shun what I begun
when you said you'd take ahonen
was my pizza even on
I knew when I asked you to not ruin myhren
you'd do the opposite of what youman
and I'd end up screamin' more obscenethan I ever hadrian
don't say it's just a phase
you clearly weren't aware
that you made me gastronomically impaired so
if you really wanna know ho

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on apizza I'm in despair
wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't
true it's just not fairrefrain refrain refrain refraine refinement
I wish it wasn justa mere

[Verse 2]
you top me with your pineapple you
devil in disguise with a devil
may care attitude I don't relate to
you I don't relate toshiharu
your pineapple game is weak
I don't relate to you no
for I'd never treat my pizza
disrespect like you doanna

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about my pizza online o
h never told a soul about your crime
'cause that shit's disgustin'it was meant to be divine
so don't you dare defend your anaheim
and don't you dare make me feel ashamed
I could talk about the guggenheim
but I'd have an empty line because your toppings are deranged
and you never paid any mind to the pepperon
is so I shut em all out for you because I was a
foodie who was blinded by your cannelton

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave my pizza alone yeah
ah
goddam
ah
f you
f you
