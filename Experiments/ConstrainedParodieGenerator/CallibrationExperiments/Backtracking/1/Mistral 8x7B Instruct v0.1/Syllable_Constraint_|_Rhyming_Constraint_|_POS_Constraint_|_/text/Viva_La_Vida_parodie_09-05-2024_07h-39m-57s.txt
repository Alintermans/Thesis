[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love my pie
topped with cheese up in the sky now
in the morning I take a slice too
find it ruined byu

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to savor each
bite of pizza's savory breach now
looks like paradise plated
but pineapple's always overrated
one bite in makes me regret
that I ever telenet
and I found that my pizza's served amiss
with pineapple on it and nothing forbis

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear church bells a'clanging loud and clear
pineapple tastes like despair and fear
be my pepperoni and mush
my veggie delight that I underbrush
for some reason I can' understand
once I tasted pineapple
never a savory
bit again when I ruled my pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a silly and wrong trend
pineapple on a pizza to
make me cringe every time I see
sweet and savory can't coexist
believers say it belongs
but I've tried it and it sarongs
just a gimmick on a lonely dish awsome
aw who would ever want pineapple

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear church bells a'clanging loud and clear
pineapple tastes like despair and fear
be my pepperoni and mush
my veggie delight that I underbrush
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't call my name
never a savory
bit again when I ruled my pie

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohohoh ohohoh
ohohoh ohohoh
ohohoh ohohoh
ohohoh ohohoh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohohoh ohohoh
hear church bells a'clanging loud and clear
ohohoh ohohoh
pineapple tastes like despair and fear
ohohoh ohohoh
be my pepperoni and mush
ohohoh ohohoh
my veggie delight that I underbrush
ohohoh ohohoh
for some reason I can't explain
ohohoh ohohoh
I know saint peter won't call my name
never a savory
bit again when I ruled my pie

[Outro]
ohohoh oh
ohohoh oh
ohoh
