[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on pizza's biannual
abomination we can all do with
without that sweet and sour
soggy bite that ruins the
crust and makes us all wish it never exists
we'll wish this never washy
pizza topped with tropical fruit's ab
omination that should never have been
I miss you acheson

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the ham and cheese got pineap
ple I can't believe it still exists
it's sacrilegious and always
this ridiculous
rumor comes creeping on making us question
if it's even food or just
an insult to all pizza
can't believe it keeps returning
with takeaways and deliver
I hope it soon will vanish
will pineapple disappear tonight dis
appear tonight wis

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
please don't add it to me you're already
the flavor inside this
I despise it I desp
please don't add it to me you're already
the flavor inside this
I despise it I desp

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
please don't add it to me you're already
the flavor inside this
I despise it I desp
please don't add it to me you're already
the flavor inside this
I despise it I desp
please don't add it to me you're already
the flavor inside this
I despise it I desp
please don't add it to me you arendsee
the flavor inside this
I despise it I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
