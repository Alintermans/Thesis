[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the meals of old and new
pepperoni andries
but never pineapple
anchovies and cheese
and plenty of marin
but pineapple on pizza just doesn't fit within

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said won't you try it
how much you wanna miss
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some unexpected twist
just something savitt
something to my lik
I want something justlike this
something I didactic
I want something sobolik

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh iwant something just
oh iwant something
oh iwant hobbyist
oh iwant something justlike this
oh iwant antitrust
oh iwant something
oh iwant gilchrest
oh iwant something tertius
I want something just ines

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the meals of old and new
no room for canaries
just ingredients we
tomatoes and basil
the marinara brew
but pineapple on pizza just doesn't fit

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said won't you try it
how much you wanna miss
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some unexpected twist
just something savitt
something to my lik
I want something justlike this
something I didactic

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh iwant something justlike this
oh iwant something ju
oh iwant something
oh iwant hitherto
oh iwant something tertius
I want something juju
oh iwant something
oh iwant malibu

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where dyou wanna go
how much you wanna miss
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some unexpected twist
just something savo
something to my lik
I want something justlike this
something I didactic
I want something sobolik

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh iwant something justlike this
oh iwant something tertius
oh iwant something tertius
