He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nall my sins need holy water washing over me like wine\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling asiain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's coming home with pineapple on pizza\nscratches head in frustration leaves\nin anger tosses the pizza in\nthe trash can fed up with pineapple messiah\npizza lover now a pineapple hafnia\nshe can't stand the taste of pineapple\non pizza she just wants a plain slice of heavenly cheese\nso why does he insist on ruining pizza with pineapple please\nit's not a real pizza with\npineapple on top it's a disgrace to pizza nation\nbut he can't resist the temptation cana\ntation to put pineapple on his pizza creation\nit's a sin against pizza pur\nists who know pineapple doesn't belong on pizza\nbut he just can't help himself he's a pineapple fanatic\ndesperate to put pineapple onondaga\non every pizza he can get his\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nall my sins need holy water washing over me like wine\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling asiain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one night stand turned a pineapple fest\nit was come morning he regretted his request\nfor pineapple on his pizza the next day\nbut it was too late she had already put\npineapple on his pizza and now he pussyfoot\naround the issue not wanting to hurt her proudfoot\nfeelings but deep down he knows pineapple on pizza is\njust not right it's a sin against pizza lovers everywhere underfoot\nso he lets it slide but deep down he knows it's not true love forever\nbut he can't bring himself tompkinses\nto tell her the truth about his feelings about pine\napple on pizza he knows it's a deal breaker for afoot\nso he keeps quiet and suffers in barfoot\nsilence pretending to enjoy blackfoot\npineapple on his pizza but foot\nin his heart he knows it's just not the same thing as\npepperoni or sausage or even\nplain cheese on his pizza\nhe wishes he could take it all back goosefoot\nto the moment before he asked for pineapple on his za\nbut\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's river my name\nmy name\ncall\nriver run\nlet the river run damme\nnot the pineapple run goemon\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the joker saying pineapple\nbelongs on pizza never assemble\npizza with pineapple on top hey it's a crime against\nhumanity and pizza afar worse than any\ncrime committed by a joker or a\nvillain trying to poison\npizza with pineappling insanity\nbut he can't help himself he's a pineapple\nfanatic always insisting on putting\npineapple on his pizza saying\nit's the only way to eat pizza right he\njust can't help himself he's a pineapple\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nall my sins need holy water washing over me like wine\nwell little one\niodine\n\nI regret saying pineapple belongs\non pizza\n\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling asiain\n",
