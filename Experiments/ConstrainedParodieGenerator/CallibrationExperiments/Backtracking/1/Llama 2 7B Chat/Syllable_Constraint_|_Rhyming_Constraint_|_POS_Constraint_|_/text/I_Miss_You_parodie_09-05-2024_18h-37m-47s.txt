[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the toppings on my pierre
the juicy sweetness that's not mine to share
we can have pepperoni
and sausage on our minds
but please don't bring the pineapple near us
it's like a nightmare reminds
we'll wish this pineapple never ends
we'll wish this pineapple never finds its
our pizza islets

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the pineapple nowad
and why does it have to show up somehow
it's like a ghostly presence in
our once peace treat
please leave us alone and haunt another zone
our pizza is sacred
our pizza is pure and
will you leave us be and stop this pain
stop this pine apple pain tonight
stop this pineapple pain ton
do not disturb our p nicolau
do not disallow

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the voice inside our
head says no to pineapp
don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the voice inside our
head says no to rocap

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the voice inside our
head says no to pineapp
don't waste your time on pineapple you' not
the voice inside our
head says no to rocap
don't waste your time on pineapple you' not
the voice inside our
head says no to nalcap
don't waste your time on pineapple you not
the voice inside our
head says no hand cap cap

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
