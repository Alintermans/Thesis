[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
how could you even consider such a thing
it's like putting ketchup on a hot dog in
time it wastes away and loses alluring

[Verse 2]
the flavors don't mix or complement each other
it's like throwing a pickle on a pepper
it's just not natural or right in any way
and the texture is offensive andover

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that taste is not here no more
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
because there we are again on that little
town street and you almost ran the red because you were looking
over at me and my mouth
watered at the thought of it and

[Verse 3]
photo album in my hands with memories of our
meals together and shared laughter and moments of joy and peacekeeper
and I remember it all too well and I can't help but
feel a pang of sadness and longing for something that
never was and never could be and never should alegrett
pineapple belong on a pizza and never
ever did and never will and never could and ne
never should and never will and never did and never
ever could and never will and
never should and never will and never did
because it's just not right and
just between us and just between you and me and just be
tween us and just between you and me and alarid

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that taste is not here no more and
I might be okay but I'm not fine at
all oh ohh oh oh hogeland

[Chorus]
because there we are again on that little town
street and you almost ran the red because you were looking down
at me and my mouth wat
tered at the thought of it and
and there we are again when nobody had to know
and you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an
oath and sacred peyot
and I remember it all too well

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
until you tore it
all up and running scar
ed careless in the name of hon
esty and I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
because I remember it all too well yeah yeah yeahyeahey
it was rare and I was there and I remember
it all too well yeahyeahyeah yeah

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you they
not weeping in a party bathroom
some actress asking me what happened a
that's what haddaway
you who charmed my father with self effacing
jokes sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come
and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
because it reminds you of innocence and it smart
izes me too goffinet
just between us and just between you

[Chorus]
because there we are again on thatli
town street and you almost ran the red because you were
looking down at me and
my mouth watered at the thought of
itand there we adarand
we are again when nob
ody had to know and
you kept me like consob
secret but illumined
you kept me like alexandrov

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I get older but your lovers stay my age
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bon
