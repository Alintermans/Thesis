he took the midnight train to hawaii dream
just a fruit enthusiast brought up in the trop
she took the midnight plane to new joachim

[Verse 2]
a tastebud on a quest for
the flavors of theatergoer
for a sweetness they can share the
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers savor
up and down the island chain
their palates exploring in the
tropical heat
hidin' somewhere in paradise
unaware that pinetta

[Verse 3]
experiments in exot
trying to find herriott
paying anything to taste the sun
just one more time

some will chew the fatigue
some will taste the trop mctigue
oh the pineapple never
ends in a tangled web of delight

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers savor
up and down the island chain
their palates exploring in the
tropical heat
hidin' somewhere in paradise
unaware that pinetta
