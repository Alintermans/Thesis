[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a reason to hate pineapp
on a pizza it should never be
I think you'll agree with me
it's justly

[Verse]
I can't believe I ever
thought it was a good idea to combine sweetener
with savory flavors in one pie
oh man what a crime against culinity
pineapple on a pizza should
never see the light of day it's a sinful sight and you
agree won't you give it a try and
join me in this fight to ban it from our lives forever
and ever and ever ander
broken hearts break bones but pineapple on alexander
never gonna let that signify
some kill some steal some break your heart buttery
but pineapple is a plywood
and I don't want to let it go so in iou
grave I'll bury it forever ohland
and you'd have thought that I would let it go and letellier

[Chorus]
in my grave I will
in my pineapple
in my pineapple I will
in my pineal
in my pineapple I will
in my pimental

[Outro]
in my grave I will
I will rotational
I will rot I will rot
I will rot I will rot alot
I will
