[Chorus]
pineapple on our
pizza should not be the thing
making us happier than ring
ever wish it wasn fer

[Verse 1]
give me a slice to chew on something other than fruit
to pair with the restitute
read the signs of our dis
doomed relationship with each
bite of pepperoni or sa
when you put it on aurea
mountain it just doesn't feel
right at all you see we've tried it before aha
doomed to repeat the same old pine beffa
they don't belong on a pie in my humbly opinion elna
oregano or red on
do but pineapple is a
no no no no no no no no we don't want it
just because hawaii is known

[Chorus]
pineapple on our pizza should not be the
thing that makes us happier than ringing in the new
ever wish it weren't true oh no oh no oh no noboru
our pizza is perfect

[Verse 2]
its supposed to be savory not
sweet and fruity like a popsicle
we want our pizza to be our sav
like our love for each other slingshot
our toppings together
like how we complement each o
like how we complete each other
our pizza isomer

[Verse 3]
but you keep insisting on putting that pineapple on
like it's the only topping that matters
like you're trying to ruin our perfect pie
but we won't let you get away withers
like how you won't let us get away
with our love being theatres
our love is like a pizza with no pineapple toppings
and we won't let you take that away from us no
so please don't put pineapple on our pizza it
makes us happier than anything inno

[Outro]
our pizza is perfect
pizza without pine is imperfect
no pineapple on our
pizza should be the thing that makes us happ
ring
ps we
don
mean it
elna
