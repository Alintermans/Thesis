[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fan of pineapple
on my pizza had to take
been a lover of the sweet and tangy taste for years now it
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is hate
my love for pineapple now is falling downstate
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his pepperoni red
lovin' every bite of it
sweat drippin' from his brow as he takes
that first bite of pineapple and he cadenhead
he knows he'll never be the same again glenfed
he's addicted to that sweet tropical
taste and he can't stop himself from going back for more
just when he thought it was safe to eat a slice without pineapple on
it creeps its way back onto
the pie and he's left with no choice but to admit defeat
he's a slave to his cravings and he featherbed
gives in to the temptation and takes another bite of
that spicy tropical delight
knowing full well he'll be sorry tomorrow morning
but he just can't resist that sweet and savory flavor they
found a loophole in the toppings rulemaking
pineapple a permanent fixture on

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one time pineapple on my pizza
made me feel like a king for a day but now it
it's just not the same without that tropical
flavor and I can't help but wonder what
I've been a fan of pineapple on my pawtuxet

now he's back and he's loving it more than ever before
can't get enough of that sweet and savory tastefor pawtuxet
