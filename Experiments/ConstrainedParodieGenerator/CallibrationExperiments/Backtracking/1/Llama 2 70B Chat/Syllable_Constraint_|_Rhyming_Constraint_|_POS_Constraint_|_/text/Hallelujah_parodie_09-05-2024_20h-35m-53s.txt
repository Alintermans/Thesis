[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on aol
but I don't really care for their opinion
it's just not a pizza topping
it goes like this the cheese the sau
the toppings they all must be just right pizza

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn'ta belongia

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness and a
flavor that's unique andria
but to me it's just a bunch of sour notes
it doesn't belong on a pie
it's like putting ketchup on ally
it's just not something that you do pizza shouldn

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn'ta belongia

[Verse 3]
you argue that it's a matter
of personal taste buddy a
but to me it's just a pineapple abom
ination on a pizza crust buddy
it's like putting pepperoni
on a cheesecake it's just not right honey child

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn'ta belongia

[Verse 4]
I know I'm not the only one
who thinks this way sunny aven
there are those who share my viewpoint too saying
pineapple has no right to be
on a pizza itty bitty
in the pizza world it's just not k kosher

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn'ta belongia
hallelujah hysteria
pineapple haters unita
hallelujah hilaria
pineapple just say nocera
hallelujah hacienda
pineapple pizza justina
hallelujah hamanaka

[Outro]
pineapple on a pizza it

for years I know this menu ear
and I've never seen anything like it oh
it's just not something that you do no no
love is not a victory ro
but pineapple on a pizza is a cold and

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time when pizza was
just cheese and sauce yeah andoras
but now you've gone and ruined it all with your
fancy topping combos ridenour
and every bite isidore
it's just not the same anymore no more halleu

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a pizza god
up above who knows arthropod
but all I've ever learned from pizza is that
pineapple doesn't belong on it it
it's not a cry that you readmit
it's just a broken pizza dream a hallelu
