[Intro]
come on pizza lovers we wanna say no to

[Verse 1]
pineapples to
pineapples are hold ina
we want you off the top of our pizza
why don't you just roll away
nothin' goes well
when pineapples ruin the del
can't be too careful with
toppings that just don't belong oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pisa
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapples you cannonball
why are you ruining the taste on the
what kind of toppings do you
ringtones the
bell and nobody wants to eat
your pizza lives by itself
it just wants to know that it's not well oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pisa
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home get ahead order something else
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave pineapples behind follow your taste
I don't wanna talk about who's ruining it

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
