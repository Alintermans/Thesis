[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' while we're meetin' some people say
it's a topping that's quite neat but I don
t think it's somethin' that I'd be
eatin' on a pie that's meant to be sav
ory not sweet that's just how I feel about it don
t you agree that it's just dov
ish to put fruit on
a pizza that's supposed to be a meal it's just not right ight
for my stomach or my taste buds it's just not tight

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know why you'd put that on a pie
don't you know it just don't belong there in the
first place I don't think it's somethi ething
that I'd ever want to see on my pizzitola

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
toppings that I love the most
you knowingly
put pinetta
on aprea
ain't no way that
I'll be eatin' itasca
ever thought of be
in' maturity

[Verse 2]
so have you got a clue
what pineapple's doin'on my pizza too
it's just not right it's a travesty tofu
gettin' all those toppings that I don't wanna see see
I'm just a man who's tryin' to be free free free to eat what
I want but when I see pineapple on alegrett
pizza it just makes me w alegrett

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know why you'd put that on a pie
don't you know it just don't belong there in the
first place I don't think it's somethi ething
that I'd ever want to see on my pizzitola

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the toppings that I love
the most you know exactly
put pinetree on aversive
ain't no way that I'll be gostev
ever thought of bein' maturely
true to myself and my taste bud
s don't you know that've
already made of
mine up kovalyov

[Outro]
do I wanna know why you'd do that to me do
you know how much it hurts to see pineapple on a
pizza that's meant for me baby we both know that
it's just not right for me maybe I'm just asea
bein' true to myself and what I believe ain't
no way that I'll be crawlin' back to that pizza with
pineapple on top it's just not my scene I'll never be
