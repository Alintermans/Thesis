[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pizza that I adair
the topping that I fear in the kitchen
the unpredictable flav
of sweet and savory mix
we can live without pineapple and still have
a meal to enjoy asics
and we'll ban pineapple forever
and in the future we'll never endure
the pain it brings allure

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab
I abhor itami

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor and I can
taste the regret in each bite taken blind
I crave for something else instead
this tropical fruit
unwelcome in my mouth like an intruder
like a visitor that won
t leave my tongue feels like a
hostage with no ransom paid leave now
now now now now now please leave now
and let my tastebuds be
please let my tastebuds be free outlined
can t you rewind

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don t waste your time on pineapple it is
already the voice of
my stomach s protest
I abhor it I abhor it myers's
don t waste your gostev
on pimeapple it sylvest

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don t waste your time on pineapple it is
already the voice of
my stomach s protest
I abhor it I abhor it myers's
don t waste your gostev
on pimeapple it sylvest
don t waste your time on pineapple itches
already a voice of
my stomach s unrest
I abhor it I abhor it myers's
don t waste your gostev
on pimeapple it sylvest

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab
I abhor itami
I abhor it I ab
I abhor itami
