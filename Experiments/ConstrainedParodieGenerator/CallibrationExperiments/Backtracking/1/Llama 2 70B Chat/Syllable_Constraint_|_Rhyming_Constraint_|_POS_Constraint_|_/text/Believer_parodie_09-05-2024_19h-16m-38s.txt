[Verse 1]
first things first
I got a message that's burning in me
I'm fired up and tired of
the way that pizza's been neglect
the way that pizza's been neglect

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you tell me what you think that I should eat
I'm the one who knows what
I'm the master of my taste buds sea
the master of mycology

[Pre-Chorus]
I was converted from a young
age taking my passion to the max
writing my poem for the few
that look at me took to me shook at me feeling me
singing from savory from the
pain taking my message from the
veins speaking my lesson from the
brain seeing the perfection through

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer a bel
pizza you break me down you build me
up a bel aol
pizza oh let the cheese melt fly oh let it
rain my life my love my appetite
it came from pizza you made mehdi
believer lilybell

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the one up above
all the hate that you heard
has turned your stomach to a dove oh oh
your spirit up above oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was choking in the crowd
building my hunger up in cloud
falling like crust to the groundhop
ping my stomach would drownbut they
never did ever lived ebbin and flowininhib
ited limited til it broke open and raffaele
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer a bel
pizza you break me down you build me

rain my life my love my appetite

[Verse 4]

by the grace of the oven and the heat
you're the pie of the future
the cheese in my mouth oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ever lived ebbin and flowin
inhibited limited til it broke open and rained down
