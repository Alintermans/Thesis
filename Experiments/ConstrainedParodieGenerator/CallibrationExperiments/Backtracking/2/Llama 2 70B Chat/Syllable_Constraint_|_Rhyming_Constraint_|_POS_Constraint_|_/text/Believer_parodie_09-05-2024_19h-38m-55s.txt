[Verse 1]
first things first
I got a message that's burning in me
I'm fired up and tired of
the way that pizza's been neglect
the way that pizza's been neglect

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you tell me what you think that I should eat
I'm the one who knows what
I'm the master of my taste buds sea
the master of mycology

[Pre-Chorus]
I was converted from a young
age taking my passion to the max
writing my poem for the few
that look at me took to me shook at me feeling me
singing from savory from the
pain taking my message from the
veins speaking my lesson from the
brain seeing the perfection through

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer a bel
pizza you break me down you build me
up a bel aol
pizza oh let the cheese melt fly oh let it
rain my life my love my appetite
it came from pizza you made mehdi
believer l

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the ones up above
all the hate inquired
has turned your spirit to a dove oh oh
your spirit up above oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was choking in the crowd
building my hunger up in the
cloud falling like crust to the ground
hoping my stomach they would crown
but they never did ever live till it broke opened
and rained down it rained down like do do do do do tinseltown
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer a bel
pizza you break me down you build me
up a bel aol
pizza oh let the cheese melt fly oh let it
rain my life my love my appetite
it came from pizza you made mehdi
believer l

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the power of the oven and the
flames you're the face of the flav
the blood in my veins oh oh
the blood in my vanselow

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ever live till it broke opened
and rained down it rained down like do do do do do tinseltown
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer a bel
pizza you break me down you build me
up a bel aol
pizza oh let the cheese melt fly oh let it
rain my life my love my appetite
it came from pizza you made mehdi
believer l
