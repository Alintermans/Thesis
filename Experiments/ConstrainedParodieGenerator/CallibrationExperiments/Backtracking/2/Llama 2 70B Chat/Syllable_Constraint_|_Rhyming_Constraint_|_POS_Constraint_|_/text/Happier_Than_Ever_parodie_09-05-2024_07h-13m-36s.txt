[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain bernheim
it doesn't workable

[Verse 1]
give me a reason why it's okay for pepperon
to be on topalian
I wish I could understand
is it a cultural man
when you said it was a hawai
an pizza topping yuppify
I knew you were mistaken
it's not a pizza you'd ever w a
have I ever asked you why mummify
your taste buds with such lies undermine my faith In humanity I
and I end up so sadden
seeing such a beautiful
piece of dough and cheese and tomato sauce go to waste
so if you really want to know

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain bernheim it doesn't work
able I wish I could explain it better I wish it newark
true I wish I could explain

[Verse 2]
you call me up asking for a slice
but all you do is criticize the
toppings that I choose to apply it's such a
shame that you can't realize vanderslice
I can't relate to you
I can't relate to you no
'cause if it were up to me I would
never treat a pizza this

[Verse 3]
and I don't go online talking smack about your to
ppings never told anyone anything
bad because that shit's embarrassing you were al
most everything and all that you did wasting
time I don't have and don't try to
make me feel bad I could talk about
every time that you showed up with a pineapple on top
but I'd have an empty line because you never did
never paid any mind to my culinary skills or
opinions so I shut them all outfitted

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just freaking leave me alone yeah freaking
le
ah ah
