[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong it was
like a crime scene without a care vaporware

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory craving sang
we're ordering at the counter getting lost
in a sea of options autumn leaves falling down
like our expectations for a tunkel

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pineapple has no place
and I might be ok but my tastebuds are
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost ruined it cause you were looking over at me
toppings in my hair I was
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza on the menu your eyes were gle
aming you used to be a little kid with a big appallingly
and your mother's telling stories bout you and your broccoli
you told me bout your cravings thinking your future was
me and you were tossing me the menu saying farias
key chain on the ground we were always skipping town
and I was thinking on the drive down any time now
hes gonna say its love you never called it what it was
til we were dead and gone and bur
ied check the pulse and come back swearing its the
same after three months in the
grave and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for
you but all I felt was shame and you held myrilla

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know its long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobodys supposed
to know you kept me like a secret but I kept you like
an oath sacred prayer and
we'd swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paper here
cause I remember it all all

[Verse 4]
they say alls well that ends well but this pizza is in
a new hell every time you double
cross my taste buds you said if we had been closer in age maybe it
would have been fine and that made
me want to die the idea you had of
me who was she a never needy ever lovely jewel whose mine re
flects on you not weeping in a pa
rty bathroom some actress asking mehdi
what happened youtsey
thats what happened you youtseyou charmed my taste bud
s with self effacing jokes sipping coffe like you
re on a late night show but then he watched me watch the front door all
night willing you to come and he said its supposed to be

[Verse 5]
time won't fly its like I'm paralyzed by it
id like to be my old self again but im still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my toppings and I amicone
alone but you keep my old pineapple from that
very first pie cause it reminds you of innocence
and it smells like me you cant
get rid of it cause you remember

[Chorus]
cause there we are again when I loved you
so back before you lost the one real thing youve ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well wind in my hosea
you were there you remem
ber it all ohara
down the stigmatism
you were there you remem
ber it all rare I wasiyu

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
ill get older but your toppings stay my age
from when your hawaiian broke my taste bud
and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half
her weight and did the twin flame bruise paint
you blue just between us did the love affair ma
im you too cause in this cit
y's barren cold I still remember the
first fall of snow and how it gli
stened as it fell I redeye

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it aol
too well just between us I member it aol aven
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare I remember it aven
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare I remember it
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare I remember it
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare I remember it aven

[Spoken Outro]
