[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on aol

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belongia

[Verse 3]
you may say I'm just old fashion

a culinary abomination

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've had pizza for
years and I know whatsoever
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pineapple on the plate
love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken pizza hearta

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy dove was moving too
and every pizza we ate was hallelu

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a pizza god
but all I've ever learned from to
ings was how to shoot at someone who outdrew
you and it's not a cry that you hear at
night it's not somebody who sarratt
it's a cold and it's a broken pizza belief
