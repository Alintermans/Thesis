[Intro]

[Verse 1]
pizza crust so fine and so
for the sauce to adriano
cheese that melts innuendo

[Pre-Chorus]

disappointing slices later I see pineapple on the
menu and I'm singing why oh why do you insistently
put pineapple on a pizza you're searching for something greater

[Chorus]

was it over when you took a bite thinking
pineapple belongs on a plate
come here pizza whispered in my ear
in your dream as you passed out baby is it

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 2]

white pizza averted
blue hawaiian abutted

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you

at least I had the decency
to keep my hunger in sight
only rumors of my delight and
satisfied slackened
oh lord I think about jumping
over tall objections just
to see you come running and
say the one thing I've been wanting but no yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout disasters later
if it's got pineapple I will assume that you'll probably disaster
you dream of my delight before it called you a lying traitor
you search in every pizza joint for something greater baby

[Chorus]

was it over when you ruined my pizza

ear in your dream as you passed out is
it over then is it is it over now
