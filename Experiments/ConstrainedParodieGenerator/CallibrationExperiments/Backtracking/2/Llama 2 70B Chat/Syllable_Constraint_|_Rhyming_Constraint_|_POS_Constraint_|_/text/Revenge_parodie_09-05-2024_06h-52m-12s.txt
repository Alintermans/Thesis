[Verse]
I've dug a hole for pineapple
can't pretend that it's a fitting fruit my deferral
oh man what a world the things I hear
if I could ban it from pizza I would cheer
some like it sweet some like it hot
but pineapple on pizza just ain't what we got it
it ruins the flavor it ruins the
taste and you'd have thought that I would let it pass and let it slide
well pizza is pictorial
so break the habit fast and leave it aside orabel
I've dug a hole for pineapple we
can't pretend that it's a fitting fruit me
dear oh man what a world the things
I hear if I could ban it from pizza I would cheer get
rid of it get rid of itty
get rid of it get rid of it get rid of it yuppified

[Outro]
