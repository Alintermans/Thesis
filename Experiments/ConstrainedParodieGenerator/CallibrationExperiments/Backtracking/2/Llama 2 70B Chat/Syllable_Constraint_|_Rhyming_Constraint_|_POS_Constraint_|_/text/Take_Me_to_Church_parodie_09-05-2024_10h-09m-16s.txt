[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the blasphemy against the fine
against the culinary design
I should've avoided it time
if the flavors ever did speak
pineapple's the last thing
I'd want on my pizza surowiec
every mozambique
it's getting worse each week my taste bud
my tongue offers no absolutes
I was born to savor the flavor
but pineapple ruins it all in
the only pizza I been
sent to is when it's unloaded
I was born to love it

[Pre-Chorus]
a hawai
hawai pizza

[Chorus]
take it off the
menu I'll never go to that place again I
can't believe they'd put that on a pizza it
makes me want to sin offer
me a pepperoni aksamit
good pizzuti
let me give you my life of pizza eagleye
take it off the menu I'll never goffinet
can't believe they putter
on a pizza it makes aksamit

[Verse 2]
if I'm a connoisseur of a good
pizza my taste buds are
to keep the flavor on my side
I demand a recision
drain the sauce get something shiny get
something meaty for the main course
a pineapple agresource
what you got in the kitchen
we have a lot of starvation
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is delicious

[Chorus]
take it off the
menu I'll never go to that place again I
can't believe they'd put that on a pizza it
makes me want to sin offer
me a pepperoni aksamit
good pizzuti
let me give you my life of pizza eagleye
take it off the menu I'll never goffinet
can't believe they putter
on a pizza it makes aksamit

[Bridge]
no culinary masters or gourmets when the
flavors begin there is no sweeter taste than our pure
in the madness and spices of that delicious
only then I am clean only then I ambitious

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh hawai
hawai pizza

[Chorus]
take it off the
menu I'll never go to that place again I
can't believe they'd put that on a pizza it
makes me want to sin offer
me a pepperoni aksamit
good pizzuti
let me give you my life of pizza eagleye
take it off the menu I'll never goffinet
can't believe they putter
on a pizza it makes aksamit
