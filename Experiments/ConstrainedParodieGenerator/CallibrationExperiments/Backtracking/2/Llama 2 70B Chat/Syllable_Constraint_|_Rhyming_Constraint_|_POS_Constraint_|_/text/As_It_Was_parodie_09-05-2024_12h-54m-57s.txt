[Intro]
come on pizza lovers we wanna say no to

[Verse 1]
pineapples on
top of your pizza iwan
you gotta hold up your hand and say no way
why do we gotta ruin a
perfectly good
piece of dough with that gyrated
topping just saying no no
nothin' to say when the toppings all wrong

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know its not the same as it was
in this world of pita
you know its not the same asmaras
its not the same asia
you know its not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
of your taste buds mcnicol
why are you settling for somethin
that just don't belong what
kind of toppings
are you putting on your pizza
your taste buds live by themselves
they just want to know that its real oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know its not the same as it was
in this world of pita
you know its not the same asmaras
its not the same asia
you know its not the same

[Bridge]
go ahead get a new pizza order
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave pineapple on the side of the plate
I don't wanna talk about who's doing it first

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know its not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
