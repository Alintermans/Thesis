[Verse]
comin' out of my kitchen and I've been cookin' just
gotta gotta be hot because I want it all
it started out with a pineapple how did it end up
like this it was only a pineapple it was
only a pineapple now I'm fallin' asleep
and she's callin' a doctor while he's havin' a
stroke and she's takin' a nap now they're goin' to
bed and my stomach is

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's touchin' my tongue now
he takes off my hunger
let me go
because I just can't taste it it's kill
in' me and takin

[Chorus]
pineapple turnin' pizza into a
disaster swimmin' through che
esy toppings chikane
on your alibis but it
s just the price iwata
destiny isadore
open up my mouth

[Guitar Solo]
