[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pizza that I adair
the topping that I fear in the kitchen
the unpredictable flav
of sweet and savory mix
we can live without pineapple and still have
a meal that isomedix
and we'll savor every bite with
and in the night we'll wish this never ends
we'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab
I abhor itami

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor and I can
not taste the cheese and sauc alone tonight
I need pepperonI and sa
this sick strange combo
comes creeping on so haunting every time
and as I stare I counted
the slices that I cannot
enjoy with pineapple on top and
hear the voice of reason saying
will you take it off and stop
this pain tonight stop this pain tonight re
missing acoly

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't ruin the pizza with pineapple
already the flavor
I abhor it I ab
please note that this parody follows heidel
berg dinner rollinger
it may notestine

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't ruin the pizza with pineapple
already the flavor
I abhor it I ab
don't ruin the pizza with pineal
please take it offender
the pizza willfully
missing acolyte being asexual
the pizza willpower
the pizza willingly
being asexual having nocturnal
emissions andover
I miss theocracy

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab
I abhor itami
I abhor it I ab
I abhor itami
