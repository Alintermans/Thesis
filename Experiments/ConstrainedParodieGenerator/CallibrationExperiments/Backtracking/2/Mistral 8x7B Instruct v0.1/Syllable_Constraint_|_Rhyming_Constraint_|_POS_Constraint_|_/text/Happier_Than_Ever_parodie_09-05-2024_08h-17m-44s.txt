[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
my taste buds scream in horror
wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't so

[Verse 1]
let me take a minute to consider this monster
this mistake upon myler
a travesty of pizza
do you see my frustration
or do you turn a blind eye to
my protestations onoda
this sweet and savory hell
I thought we had an understanding ohmura
that pineapple has no place atlanta
on a pizza pie it just don't belonga gotta beata
cheese and tomato sauce and
pepperoni and sausage
it's a classic combo that you shouldn't abusea
so don't you dare defend it

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza here I'm always
happier without it wish I could explain it clear
er I wish it wasn't true my taste buds cry in pain renssela
er I wish I could explain

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask me to share
a slice with pineapple on top oh
I hang up the phone and swear to never share
my sacred meal with such a disrepair
I won't indulge in your
sweet and savory folly no
it's an insult to my taste bud
it ruins what averted

[Verse 3]
and I don't serve pineapple on my pies these days lord
never put it on my menu for good
it's a sin to mix the sweet and savory ways
and all that you achieve is making what'd
be a feast into a travesty you
should be ashamed of yourself boyhood
you took a classic dish and turned it into a farce so don
't you dare defend it you're just a disgraceful waiter
just leave the pineapple outta here I'm telling ya you
ruin everything you touch with pinegar

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my pizzas sour
just leave the pineapple outta here for
god
sake don
' to
putter
oncor
