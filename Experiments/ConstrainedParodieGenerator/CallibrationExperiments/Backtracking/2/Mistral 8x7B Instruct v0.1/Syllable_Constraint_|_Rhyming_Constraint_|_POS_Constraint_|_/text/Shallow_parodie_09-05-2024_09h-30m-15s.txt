[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something' bout
that slice of pizza with pineapple
on top or not izz
it a tasty snack orphanages

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm appalled
at the thought of pineapple on a pizza
for real
it's a crime against our taste bud

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something hon
are you out of your culinary mind
or do you need more
ham and pineapple ain't nevermore

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm appalled
at the thought of pineapple on a pizza
for real
it's a crime against our taste bud

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I decline
that sweet and savory
combination that's a culinary crime
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha shame shallow hell
in the sha shame la di da hillel
in the sha shame hollowell
we're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
omaha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I decline
that sweet and savory
combination that's a culinary crime
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha shame shallow
in the sha shame la diario
in the sha shame hollow
we're far from the shallow now
