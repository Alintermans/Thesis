[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to forget that sin
of putting pineapple on pizza
you agreeis it a blunder
orrery

[Verse]
I've ruined two pizzas for us
can't pretend that I was just oh man what avarice
the things I tasted listeria
if I could take it back would I do it twice
some burn it tastes like ash they say
and you'd have thought I would never dare deface a pizza
well cooked crust can break your trust so bake it
and I don't wanna eat it slow so in the trash it'll
go I've ruined two bitterness
for us can't pretend that I was just oh manassas
the things I tasted nigeria
if I could take it back would I do deny
some burn it ruins allante
and you'd have thought I would never dare deface aweida
well cooked crust can break your trust goffinet
and I don't wanna eat it slow so in theatrical

[Chorus]
in the trash it'll
go inedible
it'll rot it'll rot it
'll rot inaudible
in the trash it'll unfit
for consumption u

[Outro]
in the trash it'll
go inedible u
'll rot Inaudible I
'll rot inaudible ossify
disill
