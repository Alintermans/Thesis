[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on my pizza
I won't stand for it no more
it's a culinary crisis
a culinary inertness

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare tell me it's a delicacy
I'm the one who takes a
bite and spits it out in disbelief
disbelief and grief interleaf

[Pre-Chorus]
I was forced to try it once or
twice or maybe even thrice before
writing it off for good I knew
the taste was bad and I couldn't bear it anymore
an abomination on a
pizza pie it should never be
on a pizza pie itasca
should never be upon a tree

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believerthat
pineapple shouldn't be
pain you made me a believerthat
cheese and tomassetti
pain oh let the pineapple go extinctdrive
my tastebuds back to me again
pain you made me a believerthat
pineapple donaghy

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a curse up to the gods above
all the ham and pepper
combos ruined by the doom of pineap
the doom of pineapple unwrap

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking with disgust
writing this parody forrest
hoping that people would listen
to my argument and put an
end to this monstrosity forevermoremore
pain you made me a believerthatnothing canadian
should ever be

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believerthat
pineapple shouldn't be
pain you made me a believerthat
cheese and tomassetti
pain oh let the pineapple go extinctdrive
my tastebuds back to me again
pain you made me a believerthat
pineapple donaghy

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the pepperoni and
cheese I hope you see the light
and banish pineapple from
your pizza for theism

[Pre-Chorus]
nothing canadian should ever be on pizza
an abomination on a pizza pie it should never
be upon a

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believerthat
pineapple shouldn't be
pain you made me a believerthat
cheese and tomassetti
pain oh let the pineapple go extinctdrive
my tastebuds back to me again
pain you made me a believerthat
pineapple donaghy
