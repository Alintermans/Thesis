[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the meals of old and new
pepperoni andries
but never pineapple
anchovies and cheese
and plenty of marin
but pineapple on pizza just doesn't fit within

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said won't you try it
how much you wanna miss
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some unexpected twist
just something savitt
something to dismiss
something I can bite into
something I reminis
I want something just inness

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo pomodoro sauce
doo basilico
doo tomatoes amoss
oh I want something just like this
doo formaggio chandross
doo cracchiolo
doo stuzzich holycross
oh I want something just inness
I want something just inness

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the meals of old and new
meat lovers andretti
but never pineapple
veggie lovers sansone
but never pineapple
pineapple on pizza just doesn't belong

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said won't you try it
how much you wanna miss
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some unexpected twist
just something savitt
something to dismiss
something I can bite into
something I reminis

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just inness
I want something just ines

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just inness
doo pomodoro sauce
doo basilico
doo tomatoes amoss
oh I want something just ines
doo formaggio chandross
doo cracchiolo
doo stuzzich holycross

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna miss
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some unexpected twist
just something savo
something to dismiss
something I can bite into
something I reminis
I want something just inness

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just inness
oh I want something just ines
oh I want something just iniss
