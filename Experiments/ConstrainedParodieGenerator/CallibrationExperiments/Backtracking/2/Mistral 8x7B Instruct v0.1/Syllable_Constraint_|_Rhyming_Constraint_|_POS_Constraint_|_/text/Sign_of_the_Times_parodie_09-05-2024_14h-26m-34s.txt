[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a culinary crime
don't you think it's gross inside
you can't cover up the taste with extra cheese
it's just wrong on a pizza
it's a crime against the bread

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
get served at the table
we've been here before trying tofu
or mushrooms instead of theology
we never changeable

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and listen to
the truth of the matter we need
to change our dinner plans we
need to change our dinner plans we need
to escape this culinary
disaster we need aniseed

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and give it a
rest it's time to move on to
pepperoni or sa
relish in the taste of real italian
we can enjoy together
somewhere far away deja

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
get served at the table
we've been here before trying tofu
or mushrooms instead of theology
we never changeable

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and listen to
the truth of the matter we need
to change our dinner plans we
need to change our dinner plans we need to
escape this culinary cat
astrophe we need tomato weed

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
get served at the table
we've been here before trying tofu
or mushrooms instead of theology
we never changeable

[Bridge]
we need to talk enough
we need to open
up our minds and taste
buds will we ever
change our ways we
ve been here before

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice and try something new
we got to get away
we got to get away we got to getaway
we got to get away we got to getaway
we got to we got touvier
we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
