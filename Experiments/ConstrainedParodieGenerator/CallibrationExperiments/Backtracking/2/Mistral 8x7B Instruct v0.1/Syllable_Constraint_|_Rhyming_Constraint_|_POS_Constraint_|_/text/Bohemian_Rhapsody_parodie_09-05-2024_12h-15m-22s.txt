[Intro]
is this a bad pizzachoice is pineapple
caught in an uproar no escape from reality
open your eyes take a slice and daredev
I'm just a picky boy I need aerial
sympathy for my taste preference high and lowbrowse ovo
any way the pizza slices doesn't really matter topple

[Verse 1]
mama once I tasted
pineapple on pizza disgraced my tastebuds crashed it
mama sweet and savory
but now I've gone and tossed it all away
mama ooh didn't mean to burn your tongue
if I don't taste it again tomorrow
doughboy doughboy as if nothing really matters noway

[Verse 2]
too late my palate has
spoken pineapple has no place on a pizza pie
farewell ham and cheese goodbye toppings gal
gotta leave the pineapple behind and face
mama ooh any way the pizza
I don't wanna eat
I sometimes wish I'd never tried it at all

scaramouche pineapple has no place in my platter
thunderbolts and lightning very very worrying me

hates pineapple on a pizza family
put it on a salad orchestrally
easy come easy go put it backwater
