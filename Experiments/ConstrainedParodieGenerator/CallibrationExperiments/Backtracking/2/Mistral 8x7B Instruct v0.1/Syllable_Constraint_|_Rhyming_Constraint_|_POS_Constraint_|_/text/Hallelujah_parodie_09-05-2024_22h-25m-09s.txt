[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pizza topped with pineapple
but you don't really care for it do ya shelf
it goes like this the pineapple
the taste so strange it makes you craw
as you take a bite of this pizza scandal

[Chorus]
pineapple scandal oh oh oh
pizza scandal oh ohio

[Verse 2]
your trust was strong but you needed proof
you tried it once and shatterproof
it tasted wrong and it ruined your mood oh
it left a stain on your pizza
and made you wish for pepperoni
but all you had was pineapple and sorrow

[Chorus]
pineapple scandal oh oh oh
pizza scandal oh ohio

[Verse 3]
they say it's right but you know it
sour taste on your tongue just won
and if you had a choice what would you do oh
you'd pick the mushroom over pineapple
it doesn't fit theatrical
this monstrosity of pineapple final

[Chorus]
pineapple scandal oh oh oh
pizza scandal oh ohio

[Verse 4]
I tried my best it was a mess
I wanted less of this pineapple
but all I had was this pineapple distress
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the pizza song
with nothing on my tongue but disappointment

[Chorus]
pineapple scandal oh oh oh
pizza scandal oh ohio
pineapple scandal oh oh oh
pizza scandal oh ohio
pineapple scandal oh oh oh
pizza scandal oh ohio
pineapple scandal oh oh oh
pizza scandal oh ohio
pineapple scandal oh oh oh

[Outro]
pizza scandal oh oh ohoh

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I tried it once for
I knew this dish I hadler
I used to love alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pineapple on the red
lies are not a culinary
it's a cold and it's a broken pizza scandal

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what was really going below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I bbq
the pineapple smell isuzu
and every breath we drew was disappointment

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a taste above
but all I've ever learn from love
was how to spit at someone who outdid you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who hashemite
it's a cold and it's a broken pizza scandal
