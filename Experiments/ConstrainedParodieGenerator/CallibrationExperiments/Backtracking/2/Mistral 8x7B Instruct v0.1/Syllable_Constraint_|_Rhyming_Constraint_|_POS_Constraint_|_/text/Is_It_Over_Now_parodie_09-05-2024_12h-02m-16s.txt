[Intro]
should pineapple belong on a pizza

[Verse 1]
when the box is delivered
with that sweet and savory blur
it's not fully discovered
why it should never

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later at the
table with friends and family gathered let me tell you the
truth about pineapple it just doesn't belong italy
weeps at the thought of it baby instrumental break instrument

[Chorus]
was it right when they added it on top of
ham and cheese so wrong should it be banned from the
pizzeria oven was it
over then and is it over now
should pineapple belong on a pizza no

[Post-Chorus]
should it should it should it

[Verse 2]
when it touches the dough ball
with its sticky rosol

getable it doesn't belong on
