[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love my pie
topped with cheese up in the sky now
in the morning I take a slice too
find it ruined byu

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to savor each
bite of pizza's savory breach now
looks like paradise plated
but pineapple's always overrated
one bite in makes me regret
that I ever telenet
and I found that my pizza's served amiss
with pineapple on it and nothing forbis

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear church bells a'clanging loud and clear
pineapple tastes like despair and fear
be my pepperoni and mush
my veggie delight that I underbrush
for some reason I can't
understand why pineapple
ever touched my pizza
but that was when I loved my pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a sad and sorry sight
pineapple on pizza cutting
shattered dreams and the sound of fights ens
people couldn't understand my plighty
rebels want my head on a
silver plate just because aka
pineapple's a choice that I can't relate
aw who would ever wanna eat that

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear church bells a'clanging loud and clear
pineapple tastes like despair and fear
be my pepperoni and mush
my veggie delight that I underbrush
for some reason I can't help but
wish pineapple never touched my pizza
never an honest word
but that was when I loved my pie

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no no no no no
oh no no noverco
oh no no pineo
oh no no cannizzo

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no no no no no
don't let pineapple touch my pie
oh no no noverco
oh no no pineo forever
oh no no cannizzo
can't explain why pineapple
ruins my pizzano
never an honest word ornamental
but that was cannavo
before pineapple touched my pie now
