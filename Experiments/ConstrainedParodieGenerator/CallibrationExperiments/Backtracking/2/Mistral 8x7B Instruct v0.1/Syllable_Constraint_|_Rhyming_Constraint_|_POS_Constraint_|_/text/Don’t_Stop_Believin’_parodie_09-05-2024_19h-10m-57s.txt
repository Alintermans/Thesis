[Verse 1]
just a small town slicefar from a pineapple
a classic pie with cheese and pepperoni
there's no room for fruit on a savory dishlike
a fish on a bike or a mochizuki

[Verse 2]
a chef in a steamy kitchen
the smell of dough andonian
for a bite they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights glow
their hunger searches in the night
pizza pies taste
so much better without the sweet
juicy pineapple incite

[Verse 3]
cooking hard to make it right
everyone craves thatcherite
pizza lovers pay to roll the dice
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will delight some will
spit it out inedible
oh the debate never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights glow
their hunger searches in the night
pizza pies taste
so much better without the sweet
juicy pineapple incite

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't add pineapple
hold on to that pizza
pizza lovers
don't add pineal
hold on
pizza lovers
don't add pineapple
hold on tomasina
pizza lovers
