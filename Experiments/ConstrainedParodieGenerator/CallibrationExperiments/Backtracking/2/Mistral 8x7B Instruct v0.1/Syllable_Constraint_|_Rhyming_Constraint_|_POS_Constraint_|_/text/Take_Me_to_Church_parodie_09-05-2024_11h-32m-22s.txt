[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go ical error
pineapple belongs on aflutter
my tastebuds scream in terror
if the cooks insist on adding
pineapple slices to
my pizza orderin' freshening
my appetite forging
I was raised right I say with might it
belongs on a ham and cheese plot
but never on my pizza pie plate
I won't allow it to abate
my preference inundate
it's fate to be separate tit
keep it off my pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
a pity
pity party

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at any costa de sol
or I'll refuse to take a single bite or roll
offer me a savory
oh good grief let me choose aureole
keep pineal
off my pizza pie at any cost aerosol
or I'll refuse to take a single bite amcole
offer me austerity
oh good grief let me choose anatole

[Verse 2]
if I'm a lover of the classic
pizza purist to the
toppings selective this combo
is a sacrilegious twist
drain the olive oil put something nice
cheese and pepperoni suffice
that's an elegant device
what you got in the freezer
we crave some pizza feinauer
no room for pineapple todi
this is tasty work

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at any costa de sol
or I'll refuse to take a single bite or roll
offer me a savory
oh good grief let me choose aureole
keep pineal
off my pizza pie at any cost aerosol
or I'll refuse to take a single bite amcole
offer me austerity
oh good grief let me choose anatole

[Bridge]
no pineapple or tomato when a sacred
ritual begins there is no sweeter innocence than
our pizza scene only then I am human
only then I am clean when just cheese andonian

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at any costa de sol
or I'll refuse to take a single bite or roll
offer me a savory
oh good grief let me choose aureole
keep pineal
off my pizza pie at any cost aerosol
or I'll refuse to take a single bite amcole
offer me austerity
oh good grief let me choose anatole
