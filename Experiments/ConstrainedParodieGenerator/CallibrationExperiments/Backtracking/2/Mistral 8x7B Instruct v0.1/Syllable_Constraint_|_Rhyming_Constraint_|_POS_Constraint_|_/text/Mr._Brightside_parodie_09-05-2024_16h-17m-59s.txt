[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottle in hand looking for that slice oh
it started out as a joke how did it end up like this
pineapple on a pizza ain't theorists
now I'm falling asleep with heartburn and regret
while others indulge in this culinary threat
now they're eating away and my stomach's a mess
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savoring the taste
it's in such poor taste a
let me go
I can't bear to look it's making me
lose all control yeah

[Chorus]
jealousy boils up and turns me inside
angrily swallowing this
horrid compromise andis
just the price I pay for this
culinary deified
open up my tiredness
cause I'm mr no

[Guitar Solo]
