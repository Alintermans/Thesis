[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
how could you even consider such a thing
it's like putting ketchup on a hot dog in
time it wastes away and loses alluring

[Verse 2]
the flavors don't mix or complement each other
it's like throwing a pickle on a pepper
it's just not natural or right in any way
and the texture is offensive andover

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that taste is not here no more
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
because there we are again on that little
town street and you almost ran the red because you were looking
over at me and my mouth
watered at the thought of it and

[Verse 3]
photo album in my hands with memories of our
meals together and shared laughter and moments of joy and peacekeeper
and I remember it all too well and I can't help but
feel a pang of sadness and longing for something that
never was and never could be and never should alegrett
pineapple belong on a pizza and never
ever did and never will and never could and ne
never should and never will and never did and never
ever could and never will and
never should and never will and never did
because it's just not right and
just between us and just between you and me and just be
tween us and just between you and me and just between

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that taste is not here no more and
I might be okay but I'm not fine at
all oh oh oh and neverland

[Chorus]
because there we are again on that little town
street and you almost ran the red because you were looking to
over at me and I
remember it all too well and
it was never right and never will be and never
should be and never will be and never could be and ne
ver did and never will
and never could and never will and

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpi
ace until you tor
ted it all up running
scream and I was there and I re
member it all too well and you call me up again just to
break me like a promise and I'm a crumpled up piece of pa
per lying here because I remember it all
too well and you keep me like a

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you say if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a neverneedyeverlovelyjewel whose shine reflects on you but
not weeping in a party bathroom
some actress asking me what happened you
that's what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self effacing jo
ks sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
but then he watches me watch the front door all night willing you to
come and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to fidget
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
cause it reminds you of innocence and it
smells like me and you charlet
you can't get rid of it cause you

[Chorus]
because there we are again when I loved
you so back before you lost the one real thing you've e
ever known it was rare
I was there I remember it
all too well wind in my hair
you were there I was there
sacred prayer I was there
it was rare I was there
I remember it all
too well wind in my hair you were

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your lovers stay my age
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bon
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
and did the twin flame bruise painting you
blue just between us did the love affair mahe
andover and ever did
just between us do you remember it
all too well wind in my hair you
were there I was there sakau

[Outro]
just between us do you remember it all too well wind
in my hair you were there I was there sacred pergande
it was rare I was there I remember it all too well unwind
my hair you were there I was there sacred
prayer I was there it was rare I was
