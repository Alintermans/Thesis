[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fan of pineapple
on my pizza had to take
been a lover of the sweet and tangy taste for years now it
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is hate
my love for pineapple now is falling like the
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his mouth waterinig
thinkin' about that sweet hawai
pineapple and how it'll pair with
the sausage and pepperoni too nevermind
he's got a date with mushrooms and olives too mind
he'll take anything but pineapple no
it's a chess match he's on the attack with his toppings of
she's kept track of all his pizza toppings preferences and now she
knows he won't settle for
anything less than the king of toppings himself pineapp
actually just shit on my last pizza and
she has what my ex lacks a love for pineapple even
though she loves danger psychopath
and you don't fuck with no man's pizza toppings I
care but she's devised a plan to top him off with pineapple and
knife in hand says their pizza relationship
hanging by a strand but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]

he found out now she feels deserted and used
cause he left so what he did it first to her

vert to the studio like hole in the wall diners don't needler
reserved in a booth I just feel like the person who I'm turning int
irreversible I predatory
on you I don't want you to have any of it
took advantage in my thirst to pursue the perfect pieper
now that I got you I don't needier
don't get on my soapbox andover
my sermon and speech dunkelberger

her in the oven we can't bring her

known to use protection before theater
took a bite of her forbidden fruit and fuck did I do that
dam
