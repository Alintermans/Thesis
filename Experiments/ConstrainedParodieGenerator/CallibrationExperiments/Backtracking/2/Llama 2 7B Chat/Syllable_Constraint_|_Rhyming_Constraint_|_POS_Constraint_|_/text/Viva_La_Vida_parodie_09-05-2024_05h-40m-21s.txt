[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I tried to put pineapp
on a pizza once beforehand
but now I see it's just a sinful
disaster waiting atmel

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
it doesn't belong on
a pie with cheese and pepperoni
how could anyone think it
ever made sense to combine appellate
one tastes like paradise the
other like garbage inda
blender with too many ingredients
that's why pineapple should never inhalants

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringin' no
pineapple cavalry choirs are sing
remove it from the menu now
it's a crime against humanity ha
for some reason I can't explain
how it ever became a
topping on a pizza
never an honest word I know

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it looks like a tropical storm
fruity flavor overpower
should be reserved for fruit salads or
desserts not on a savory pie that
needs to be taken to the
trash where it belongs toiletry
just a trend that needs to be reversed today
pineapple off the pizza menu

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringin' no
pineapple cavalry choirs are sing
remove it from the menu now
it's a crime against humanity ha
for some reason I can't explain
how it ever became a topping on
a pizza never an
honest word I know will never

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh ohio
oh oh oh oh oh no
oh oh oh nobuo

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
pineapple bells are ring
pineapple cavalry choirs are sing
pineapple offending
pineapple crimes against humanit
pineapple pardoning
remove it from the menu now
pineapple bellowing
no pineapple on the pizza pava
never an honest word
I know pineapple should never be
on a piggybacking
itself should never inhale pineapple
ever made sense tocomb
pineapple should never be on

[Outro]
