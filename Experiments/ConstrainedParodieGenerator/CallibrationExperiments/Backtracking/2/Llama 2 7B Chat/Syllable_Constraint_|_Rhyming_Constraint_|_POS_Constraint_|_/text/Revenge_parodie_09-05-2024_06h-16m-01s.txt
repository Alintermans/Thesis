[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a reason to hate pineapp
on a pizza it should never be
I think you'll agree with me
itami

[Verse]
I've tasted the sweetest of to
savory flavors on my pizza crust before ira
oh man I can't believe you would
ruin a perfectly good pie with some fruit
some say it adds a tropical
flavor but I say it's a crime to put a pineapple
on a pizza it just doesn't belong
and you'd think I would let it go and let you walk away but
my pizza is myopia
and I don't wanna let it go so inamura
grave I'll bury it alive glenwood
I've tasted the sweetest of to convolute
flavors on my pictorial
oh man I cannot believe you would take it witherell
pineapple on a pizza hindelong
and you would have thought that I would let it go and laminate

[Chorus]
in my grave I will
mould my pineapple
in my grave I will bury
my pictorial
in my grave I willingly
perish witherell

[Outro]
in my pineapple
I will bacterial
my pizza crust before
is my pain your freedom xicor
