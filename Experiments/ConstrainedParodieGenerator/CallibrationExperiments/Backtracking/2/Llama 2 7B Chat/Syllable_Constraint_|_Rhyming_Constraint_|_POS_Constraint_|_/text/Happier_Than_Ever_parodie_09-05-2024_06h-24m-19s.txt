[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
ain't no reason why it
I'm happier than everitt
I wish I could explain

[Verse 1]
give me a slice of cheese to think of something clever
to tell me whatsoever
do you read my interviews
or do you skip my arom
when you said you were passin' through
was I even on your agnew
I knew when I asked you to
be cool about what I was tellin' you isu
you'd do the opposite of wasiyu
and I'd end up more dismayed at your sheer audacity amadou
don't say it isn't fair
you clearly weren't aware
that you made me incredulous with your pineapple
so if you really want to know

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie ay ay ay ay ay ay
happier than ever ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
I wish I could explain it better ay ay ay ay ayende
you call me again when you

[Verse 2]
you drive your car to the store to buy
a pizza with pineapple on top
you scare me to death but I'm unable to
because you only listen ossify
I donno relate to you
I donno relate to you no
'cause I'd never treat myself this ins
you ruined the paredes

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk trash on the internet about you
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was put me sinead
I could talk about every time that
you gave me a reason amistad
but I'd have an empty line because you never did ado
never paid any mind to my mother or friends so
I shut them all out for you because I was a kiddo
ahhahahaahahahaha haavelmo

[Outro]
you made everything bitter
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments our
just fuckin' leave me alone already
ah
ahah
ah
ahah
sorry
