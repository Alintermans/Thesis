[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the toppings on my pierre
the juicy sweetness that's not mine to share
we can't live without che
the flavor that's just beyond
we'll have pineapple on pizza every
and in the night vagabond
we'll wish this anomaly never
we'll wish this anomaly never ends
I hope you comprehends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where are the pepperoni and
the mushrooms that I know and love so well
I crave something more than just a
a tropical treat
will pineapple on pizza ever be a
part of our history
will pineapple on pizza
will pineapple on pizza
will pineapple on pizza be
part of our history
I hope you see the light and followell
follow aol

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't give me pineapple on my pizza
you're already breaking
the rules of the game of
don't give me pineapple onondaga
you're already breaking
the rules of aversive

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't give me pineapple on my pizza

the rules of aversive
don't give me pineapple on myrilla

the rules of aversive
don't give me pineapple on peterka
