[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza cannot be rightly so
gotta get it off before I lose my mind you
it started out with a toppingchoice how did it end up
it was only a pizza topping buttercup
now I'm foaming at the mouth and she's dialing
while they're cooing over the pepperoni and
now they're going back for seconds and my stomach
and it's all in my taste

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's nibbling on the
he takes offensively
let it go
and I just can't smell it getting worse
and taking over

[Chorus]
jealousy transforms pineapple into
fermenting in my stomach
chewing on my sanity
but It's just the flavor I
destiny hasegawa
open up my canonic
'cause I'm mr bitter

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
I am coming out of my shell and I'm doing just fine
gotta get it off before I lose my mind you
it started out with a topping choice how did it end up
it was only a pizza topping buttercup
now I'm foaming at the mouth and she's dialing
while they're cooing over the pepperoni and
now they're going back for seconds and my stomach
and it's all in my taste

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's nibbling on the
he takes offensively
let it go
and I just can't smell it getting
and taking over

[Chorus]
jealousy transforms pineapple into
fermenting in my stomach
chewing on my sanity
but It's just the flavor I
destiny hasegawa
open up my canonic
'cause I'm mr bitter

[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never
