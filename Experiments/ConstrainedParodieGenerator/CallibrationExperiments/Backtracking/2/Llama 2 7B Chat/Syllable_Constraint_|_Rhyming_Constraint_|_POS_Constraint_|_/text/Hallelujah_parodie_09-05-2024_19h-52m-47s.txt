[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should not
be a crime against humanity
it's a topping that just doesn't belong oh no

hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineal

[Verse 2]

not ruined by a tropical
flavor that's foreign to usable

[Chorus]
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineal

[Verse 3]
it's like singing a hallelu
jah but with a different mel
it's just not the same oh please don't make me
eat a pizza with a fruit on top oh
it's like putting aversano
on a pepperoni pie oh no no no

[Chorus]
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineal

[Verse 4]
you can have your toppings of choice
but pineapple is not intervoice
it's a pizza that's perfect just the way it

on a pie that's holy oh no no no no

and I've seen your margherita on the

what's really going undergo
but now you never showing it to me do
and remember when I wasiyu

but all I've ever learned from love
is how to despise a pineapple on a
pie that's holy oh no no no no no
