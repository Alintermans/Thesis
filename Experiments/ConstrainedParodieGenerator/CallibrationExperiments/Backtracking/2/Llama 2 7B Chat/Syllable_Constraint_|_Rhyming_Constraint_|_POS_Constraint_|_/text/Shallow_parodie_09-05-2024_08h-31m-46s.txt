[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza you sayin' no way man it

can't stand the sweetness itami

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm revol
in the toppings game I find myself revol
agin

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]

ain't you tired of the fruit on top
or do you need more
can't you see it don't belong no

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in the toppings game I find myself going
for it
oregano and pepperoni

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never pineapple
crash through the surface where it don't belong
we're far from the hawaii

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]

in the toppin game donais

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never pineapple
crash through the surface where it don't belong
we're far from the hawaii

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the toppin game ha
in the toppin game sh alla
in the topp natalle
we're far from the pineapple
