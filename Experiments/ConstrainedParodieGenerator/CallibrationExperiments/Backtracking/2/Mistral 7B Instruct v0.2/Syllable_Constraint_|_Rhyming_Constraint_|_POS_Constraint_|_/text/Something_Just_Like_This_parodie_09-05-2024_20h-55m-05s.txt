the foods that we consume
pepperoni oran
cheese and tomato blo
vegetarian
pineapple on a lo
but I'm not that kind of eater that it goes with flow

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said grab a slice or two
how adventurous can
I'm not looking for a meal with
some exotic flavor plan
a culinary
a tropical twist
just something simple I can
digest and cheesiest
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo du du doo du du
doo du du doo du
doo du du duena
oh I want something just like this
doo du du duena
doo du duana
doo du du duena
oh I want something just forbis
I want something just forbis

the foods that we consume
seafood orangutan

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said try something new and bold
how exciting can be
I'm not looking for a meal with
an unexpected decree

I want something just like this
I want something just forbis

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a meal with
some unexpected twist or
a culinary
a controversial
just something simple I can
digest and forgetful
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just forbis
oh I want something just forbis
