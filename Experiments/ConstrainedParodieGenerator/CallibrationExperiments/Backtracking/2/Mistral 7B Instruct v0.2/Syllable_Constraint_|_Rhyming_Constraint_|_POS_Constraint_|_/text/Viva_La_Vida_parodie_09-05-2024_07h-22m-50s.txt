[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to cherish the
world with pineapple on the top
now in the kitchen I stand alone
chopping up ingredients

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to believe the
myth of savory delightful blend
listened as the critics sing
now the old foodie is dead longstanding
one minute it tasted fine
next a crime against goodine
and I discovered that my recipes
upon preference of salt and vanities

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear criticism bells a'warning
pundits rant and rave are swarming round
be my mirror my adversers
my tasters in a foreign courtiers
for some reason I cannot explain
once you left there was never
never a savory
and that was when I did not rule

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a bitter and absurd
wind that blew away my pride and
shattered kitchenware and the sound of
protests from those who once admired me
pineapple revolution
waits for my expulsion froman
just a chef on a lonely string mumbling
aw who would ever wanna be king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear criticism bells a'warning
pundits rant and rave are swarming round
be my mirror my adversers
my tasters in a foreign courtiers
for some reason I cannot explain
I know michelin won't call my name
never a savory
but that was when I did not rule

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohohohohohoh
ohohohohohoh
ohohohohohoh
ohohohohohoh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohohohohohoh
hear criticism bells a'warning
ohohohohohoh
pundits rant and rave are swarming round
ohohohohohoh
be my mirror my adversers
ohohohohohoh
my tasters in a foreign courtiers
ohohohohohoh
for some reason I cannot explain
ohohohohohoh
I know michelin won't call my name
never a savory
but that was when I did not rule
