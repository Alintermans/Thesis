[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
he's the sneer at the barbequetable
pineapple on a pizza tangle
I should've said it before the
if the foodie gods ever spoke
they'd scornfully poke and
every slice feels like vanderkol
a fresh disappointment
we were born traditional we were
told that pineapple's an abom
she insists it's a culinary
demands a sacrifice of ham and
that's a fine looking toland
what you got in the panhandler
we've a lot of starvin

[Pre-Chorus]
a hunger
amen menor

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a monkey at the shrine of your
I'll confess my heresies and you can season
offer me that tasteless tomb
oh pineapple god let mexican
take mehaffey
I'll worship like a monkey at the shrine of your
I'll confess my heresies and you mayerson
offer me that vandenbo
oh pineapple god let meyerman

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the classic
my lover's the pizza
to keep the tradition on his
he demands a sacrifice
take away the pineapple ocean
something savory for the main
that's a fine looking delaine
what you got in the oven
we've a lot of famished an
that looks terrible forbidden
this is hunger work

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a monkey at the shrine of your
I'll confess my heresies and you can season
offer me that tasteless tomb
oh pineapple god let mexican
take mehaffey
I'll worship like a monkey at the shr deplore
I'll confess my heresies and you mayerson
offer me that vandenbo
oh pineapple god let meyerman

[Bridge]
no chefs nor rules when the ritual commences
there is no purer satisfaction than our gentle
in the madness and chaos of that sad pizza
only then I am human only then myrilla

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a monkey at the shrine of your
I'll confess my heresies and you can season
offer me that tasteless tomb
oh pineapple god let mexican
take mehaffey
I'll worship like a monkey at the shrine of your
I'll confess my heresies and you mayerson
offer me that vandenbo
oh pineapple god let meyerman
