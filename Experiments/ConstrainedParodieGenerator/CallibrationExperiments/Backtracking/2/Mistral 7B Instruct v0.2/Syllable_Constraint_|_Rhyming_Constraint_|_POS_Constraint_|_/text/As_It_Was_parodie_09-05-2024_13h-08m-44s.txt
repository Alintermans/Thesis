[Intro]
come on pepperoni lovers worldwide today

[Verse 1]
topping it off
pineapple's interference
I want you to appreciate the savour
why don't we agree and set
it aside and
when tastebuds collide inland
it seems your palate cannot
be replaced and I'll be the one to stay

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple lovers mayall
why are you arguing at the table
what sauce are you using now
dialing for
pizza delivery comes knock
your olives dream all alone
they just want to know that it's not long ago

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
take it off the pie my friends tonight speed
I don't wanna debate the way it used to be
emigrate to italy two cheeses
I don't wanna debate who's doing it first or

[Outro]
pe
as it was
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
