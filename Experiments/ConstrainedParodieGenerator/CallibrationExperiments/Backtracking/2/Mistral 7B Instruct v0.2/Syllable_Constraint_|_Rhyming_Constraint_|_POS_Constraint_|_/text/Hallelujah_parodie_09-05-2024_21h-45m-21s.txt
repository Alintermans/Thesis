[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that hawaii cooked and it clannish
but you don't really crave for pizza might be
it goes like this the sixth the e
the flat flavor the savory
the mysterious pineapple debate oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hagle

[Verse 2]
your palate was strong but you needed
proof a pineapple intruded
its sweetness in the oven overthrew ya
they sliced it up and they scattered
on the cheese and tomato batter
and from your plate they drew the hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hagle

[Verse 3]
you say I argued in vain with
my hatred for this fruitcombine
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a contrast of tastes in every
slice it doesn't matter whatley
the gourmet or the

[Chorus]
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hagle

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I tried to touch
I've spoken the truth I didn't come to fool
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord dejon
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hagle
hallelujah pizza haggle
hallelujah pizza hollow

hallelujah pizza hagle

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this dish I've spatafore
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pepperoni on the
marble arch love isabella
it's not a cry that you hear at nighttime hallel

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never taste it to me do you
and remember when I mashalu
the mozzarella oahu
and every slice we drew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to argue against someone who out
and it's not a cheer that you hear at night
it's not somebody who hashemite
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
