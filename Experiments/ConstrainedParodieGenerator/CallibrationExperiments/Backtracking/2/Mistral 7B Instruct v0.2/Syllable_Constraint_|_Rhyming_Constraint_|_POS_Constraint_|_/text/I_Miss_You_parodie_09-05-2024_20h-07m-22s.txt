[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the intruder underwear
the irritant on my pizza pie with
the unexpected flavor
of sweetness in the valley
we can live without pepperoni if we
choose where you cangialosi
and we'll have summer in december
and in the night we'll argue this never
ends this debate weaker

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the pineapple gone and I
apologize for this culinary
I cannot dine alone tonight
this unusual
topping comes creeping on so boldly each time
and as I contemplate it
the juice from the pineapple
drips down and ruins my delightful
pizza creation's integrity
and as I ponder whether
to remove it or endure myslinski
will you returnee

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't put it there for me you've already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't put it there for me you knowingly
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't put it there for me you're already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't put it there for me you thoughtfully
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't put it there for me you intention
ally the voice inside
I pine for peace atop
don't put it there for me you recklessly
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
