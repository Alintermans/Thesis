[Intro]
is it pineapple on a pizza night

[Verse 1]
once the meal was maderight
with the taste of savory bit
but you insisted nolet
pineapple on it

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand slices later tonight
I see the pineapple chunks on your plate so inconsider
you crave my pepperoni before it labeled impolite
you search in every vegetarian's pie for something greater

[Chorus]
was it tasty when it landed on your slice
was it tasty when it melted in your eyes
I spoke against it in your ear
in your delirium as you passed
was it tasty then and is it tasty now

[Post-Chorus]
is it tastesalright

[Verse 2]
when you lost control tonight
tomatoes andesite
cheese and pineapple boatright
your new palate is me

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
these were mushroom lights
at least I had the courtesy
to keep my preferences
only rumors about my cheese and
my whispered moorland
oh pineapple I think about
ordering off of very
long menus just to see you
come running and say the one thing I've been long

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand arguments later tonight
if it's got pineapple chunks I'll conjure up a mighty fright gigaby
you crave my pepperoni before it labels me disinvite
you search in every foodie's pie for something greater goodnight

[Chorus]
was it savory when it landed on your
was it savory when it melted in your
ears I whispered against it in
in your delusion as you passed out
was it savory then and is it savvy

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it tastesalright
islet
is it letarte

[Bridge]
thought I didn't notice
these were pineapple
at least I had the courtesy
to keep my diets under
only rumors about my cheese and
my whispered moorland
oh pineapple I think about
ordering off of very
long menus just to see you come run
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Outro]
pineapple lights oh pine
let's fast forward to a thousand takeout orders later hey
pineapple lights I was hoping you'd be
and say the one thing pinep
I've been wanting but no
was it
was it tastesalright was it tastesalright
