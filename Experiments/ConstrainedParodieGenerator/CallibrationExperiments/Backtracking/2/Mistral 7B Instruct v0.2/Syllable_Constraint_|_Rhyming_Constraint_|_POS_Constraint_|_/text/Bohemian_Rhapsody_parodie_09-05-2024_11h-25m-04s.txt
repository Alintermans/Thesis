[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
pineapple on a pipe dreamlandslide agoglia
open your eyes gaze upon theophila
I'm just a simple slice I donapria
easy come easy go with a savory low or high high
any way the slices blow makes no difference toquepala

[Verse 1]
papa just ordered a
pineapple on top of my pizza made a disaster
papa disappointment served
but now I've made this culinary ab
error papa did not intend to make
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
topping on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my order has
come pineapple's aversion sends shivers down my taste
goodbye discerning diners I've got to
go accept the truth papa did not intend
papa did not mean to make me pine
I don't wanna pine
sometimes I wish I'd never been served at all
