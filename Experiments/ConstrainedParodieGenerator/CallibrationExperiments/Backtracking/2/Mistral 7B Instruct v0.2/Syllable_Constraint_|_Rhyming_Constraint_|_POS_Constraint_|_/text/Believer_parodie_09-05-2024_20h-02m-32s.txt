[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about a topic quite absurd
pineapple on pizza's lure is
ruining meals with its allure
ruining meals with its allure

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you judge me for my taste preference we
have the right to our
pizza toppings that we choose to be
our pizza topsy-turvy

[Pre-Chorus]
it's been a longstanding debate
breaking friendships and family ties
some say it's sweet and savory
others claim it's just a disguise trying to deceive
finding common ground in our
shared love for pizzas we create
singing our defense forger
standing up for our beloved

[Chorus]
pineapplepie you made me a belie
ver believing in this
pineapplepie you drove me to my knees
w elitists
pineapplepie you made me a believerbel
iever believing in this strange com
bination of flavors unify
verses opinion diss

[Verse 3]
third things third
say a prayer for those who disagree
this pineapple onward
leads us to a new degree of glee oh
our taste buds innuendo

[Pre-Chorus]
we were divided in the
pizza realm building our case
topping up our arguments
hoping our preferences
wouldn't cause a taste clash but it never did instead
it brought us closer than we've been in ages injustices
our shared love

[Chorus]
pineapplepie you made me a belie
ver believing in this
pineapplepie you drove me to my knees
w elitists
pineapplepie you made me a believerbel
iever believing in this strange com
bination of flavors unify
verses opinion diss

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the oven and the cheese
you're the tastemaker of
the future of pizza cre
ating new combinations

[Pre-Chorus]
but our love remains unbroken and true despite
the debate that's been raging since time immemorial we
will continue

[Chorus]
pineapplepie you made me a belie
ver believing in this
pineapplepie you drove me to my knees
w elitists
pineapplepie you made me a believerbel
iever believing in this strange com
bination of flavors unify
verses opinion diss
