[Verse 1]
twenty years with this endless
struggle to remove that pineapple pester
from the savory dish
I tried to reason with those who insist
that this tropical fruit adds flavor to blissful dish
but what does it mean to

[Pre-Chorus]
so I sigh sometimes when I'm standing at the stove
just to express my feelings nov
and I weary in the morning when I open
the fridge and find that pineapple's been stolen again
and I take a deep breath and I let it go
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's happening

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyheyhey
heckuva
I said hey what's happening here
heyeyheyhey heckuva

I said hey what's happening here

[Bridge]

and I ple
oh my goodness dopey
I plead all the time
in this culinary
and I pray

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm standing at the
counter with a knife in mycology
and I weary in the morning when I open
the fridge and find that pineapple's been stolen again
and I take a deep breath and I let it go
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's happening

[Chorus]
