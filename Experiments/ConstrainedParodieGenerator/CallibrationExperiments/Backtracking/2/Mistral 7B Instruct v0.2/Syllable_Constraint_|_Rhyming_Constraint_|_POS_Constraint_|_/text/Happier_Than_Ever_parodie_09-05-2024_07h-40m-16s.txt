[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our culinary scene
I'm tastier than evergreen
wish I could claridon

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to craft a reasoning schol
to write myself aureole
to tell us all to follow
do you savor every
or ignore our savory
when you said you liked italy
was our pizza even
on your gustatory agenda wearily
we knew when we asked you topsy-turvy
you'd add it anyway with a shrug and a winky emphatically
and we'd end up more confused
don't say it's amusing
you clearly weren't impressing with your pineapple
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now we thrive and grow
we're tastier than ever bestow upon us the
wish we could explain it better clearer than before wassily
we wish it wasn't true tom

[Verse 2]
you call us again loaded with your
maraschino cherries in tow with
your pineapple obsession you frighten us
you only listen to your parador
we don't fit your flavor
we don't fit your flavor no
'cause we'd never put pineapple on
our beloved marathon

[Verse 3]
and we don't defend pineapple on the internet
never told anybody anything
'cause that's just disappointing it was our delight
and all that you did was make our creeping
us sad so don't waste our time we
don't try to justify thesing
we could reminisce about every time that you ordered
on time but we'd have an empty line since you never
did keep all our friends out for you because we were na
ve we trusted you with our garnier

[Outro]
you ruined our flavors
constantly misunder theatres
made our dishes your own
just pineapple away leave us alone
ah
goddam
ah
just pine
apple
