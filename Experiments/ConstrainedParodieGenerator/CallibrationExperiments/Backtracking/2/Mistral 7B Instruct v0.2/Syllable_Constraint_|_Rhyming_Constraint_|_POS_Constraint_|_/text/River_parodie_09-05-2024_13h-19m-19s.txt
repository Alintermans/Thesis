[Verse 1: Eminem]
he brings it home sliced on his pizza plate to
jack daniels and tomato sauce
but she hates it with a passion so
it's a battle in the kitchen heated andrew
he insists it complements the dish butala
she's determined to set this debate al
and claims it's an affront to italian cuisine so raw
now they're on a collision course like a runaway carnival ride
it's a standoff in the pan
and she's got a can of pineapple chunks ready to brand
'cause she's devoted to tradition andolina
and you don't mix fruit with savory dishes even
I know she's cooking up a plan
and I'm the unwitting pawn in her culinary
'cause she's a purist and I'm a fan of the sweet and the savory
but I should've listened to mycology
after the first bite but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pirate leading a
been a jester causing a
been a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on
all my sins need cleansing water felt it washing over
well little one I don't want
if all it's gonna cause a commotion inmont
the truth and my lies now

[Verse 2: Eminem]
one slice led to two and then to three nights
it was love at first bite but now it's sour and
he confessed his love for the tropical fruit
but she felt betrayed and left in the lurch and
now how am I supposed to tell this girl beforehand
it's tough to find the words I'm awkward and maryland
don't want this to hurt but what she deserves is the truth
so I retreat to the kitchen like a secret hideout room underfund
I just feel like the person I'm becoming is irreversible
I justified my actions maryruth
and now that I've tasted her disapproval I don
t want her anymore I've moved on to someone newfoundland
why do I do this thing that I do ohland
get on my soapbox and preach meadowland
pineapple on pizza stangeland
'cause now with her in the oven I can't bring her
to the table should've known to use a
vegetarian to
pineapple before I took aforement
it's a fruit that's for desserts not for pizzas galoreland

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the outsider in the pizza
line never the one in theophila
fuck can I say if pizza was a highway of flavors
and pineapple was an obstacle I'd be swerving
in five lanes speeds at a high rate like a
slide on a banana pe
but I may have came at you sidestepping
the boundaries of tradition I can't keep
my lies straight but I made you terminateour
child this love triangle hasler
what else can I say it was fun for a
while but I really would've loved your smile land

my lies now are falling like the rain ireland
so let the river run
