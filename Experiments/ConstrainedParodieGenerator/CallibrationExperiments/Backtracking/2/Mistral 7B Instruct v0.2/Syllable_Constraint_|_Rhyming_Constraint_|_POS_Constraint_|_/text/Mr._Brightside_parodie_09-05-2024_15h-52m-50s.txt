[Verse]
comin' out of my kitchen and I've been doin' just
gotta hide in the corner because pineapple
started out on the piecrustbut ended up on the dish
it was only a topping it was only a
now I'm makin' a face and they're packin' it up
while he savors a slice and she's takin' a bite
now they're enjoyin' their meal and my appetite's
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's slicing his pizza
he takes off hisada
let me go
'cause I just can't look it's ruining the
and takin' control

[Chorus]
taste budsityturnin' foodiesinto
swimmin' through tropical lies
chokin' on your compromise
but it's just the price I pay
pineapple destitution
open up my sensitize
'cause I'm mr veghead

[Guitar Solo]
