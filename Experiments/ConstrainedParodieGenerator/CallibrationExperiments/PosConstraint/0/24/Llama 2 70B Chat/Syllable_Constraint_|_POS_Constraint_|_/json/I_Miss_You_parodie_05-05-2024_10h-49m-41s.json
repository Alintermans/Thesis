And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nmy wo I my missing\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nellowo\na nutter in who people\nthe unaverageing in every\nthe iced drinkin winner please\nthat everyone around that\nwhat appears does like taegaysoa but only\never my can only hall\nand my am will thing in delight ar\nor like those evil he dark may a so\nit tends see those never\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nme watn my my missing\nmy is me it wopping\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere go your and your wanted more\nour is less can our make again\nyour can people and now only\nthis many room em\ntime get that on ca those ohers way insome\nand as my has its counted\nan animals over each\nmaking sounds but taking them inner\nin sidewalkin up being\nbut are who voice over mine\nbeing her should someone but could that time\nbeen this decide sto\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nsave just own you yours by your its am how still\nevery make without\nher being our who\n\nplease regularly set me adries that they\nsome get over it voice\nmy missing you her wo\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nseeaving so woning they day over her we\nall makin like who\nits got her me missing\n\ngeting so iving him voice under she they\nany seekin about\nmy will they their wanted\n\nmake how can us anyone into it you\nan give into me hers\nits be their our can\n\nmakeing how won they time around our you\nany tell like our\nits got she your could you\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nhe ba my she missing\nour could who our\nits had their our will\n",
