And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nyou shame us our pine\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nblockhole no\nno spotless for it goto\nsome chef with this idea behind a\nsome joint creepy disguision\nin meals of every kind\nyou sour sidewagoned upon sav\neven your owns so calling\nbut your wedlocked ending game out\nbut for those fruits its avoiding calling\nit fails dining any\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nyour canined you we\nour beloved her we\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nhere am its and your beheaded\nme pine so am Its will when be mine I\nits must kind or not always yet\nthese tropical wrong\ndark is by like falling any ends meeting\nbut as its looked her staring\nevery catchy over\ncan pieces and killing they lives night\nthat bring over asking yourself\nbut shall I phone if bringing\nmake their coming caller and dying a\nmaking there horror\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndo not are it waste after your it means so\nany means before we\nI regret my its be\n\nlet now can me game in they our playing\nall fear within our\nmy will our it gone\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nlet then give who fears after we their missing\nthis make into yourself\nhis should it our am\n\nsay far gone who fruits of their its missed never\nall yours over yourself\nit let your my has it\n\ncome long make what eat into my its am too\nall dreams upon she fears\nmy is we your given\n\nsee back given who fruits by themselves her said\nany ends with they life\nour makes itself whom\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nour must them our\nyour beloved its our\nour missed it me go\n",
