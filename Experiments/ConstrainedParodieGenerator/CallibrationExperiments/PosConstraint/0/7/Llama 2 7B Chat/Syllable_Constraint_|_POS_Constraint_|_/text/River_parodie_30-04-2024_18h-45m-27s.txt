[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a crime
been a topping for some poor soul to choke on and die in the
all my sins need holy water to wash away the shame
well little one I don't want
to admit to something that will bring me pain and
blame but pineapple on

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his neck scratched to catch some
flack from the pepperoni and
sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched to
on his breath jack he's a pineapple addict and
she just wants to exact revenge and get back at
it's a chess match she's on his back like a
jetpack but she's kept track of all his pizza toppings and
guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next slice of bread and
actually just shifted
my last pineapple and she has what my ex lacked and cra
'cause she loves danger psychopath and you don't mess
with no man's pizza even I know that and she's using
me to try to top him off and
I know she's using me to try to top him off and
hi pineapple but I should have said bye pineapple after the
first slice but tonight I am and the river
runs with pineapple on top and I don

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a crime
been a topping for some poor soul to choke on and die in the
all my sins need holy water to wash away the shame
well little one I don't want
to admit to something that will bring me pain and
blame but pineapple on

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand and
it was come sunlight scram now we huff and puff and
he found out now she feels deserted and used
'cause he left so what he did it first to her too
now how am I supposed to tell this pizza that we
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the
truth and don't take it personal I just can't say
this in person to you so I revert to the studio like hole in
the wall diners don't have to be reserved in a booth and I just
feel like the person who I'm turning to
is irreversible I preyed on you like it's church
at the pew and now that I got you I don't want you to
use protection before I bite into your
forbidden fruit and fuck and the river
runs with pineapple on top and the
bridge eminem and ed sheeran my name's oh oh
river run and call me oh oh river
we'll let the river run
and the truth and my lies now are falling like
the rain so let the river run and the river runs with pin

I've been a pineapple on a

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's oh oh river
run and
call
me oh oh
river and we'll let the
river run and the truth and my lies

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the pineapple never the crime
if life was a pizza and deceit was
an enclave I'd be swerving in five lanes and speeds at a
high rate like I'm sliding on Ice maybe that's why I
may have came at you sideways and I can
t keep my lies straight but didn
I made you terminate my topping and
this love triangle left us in a mess tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really would have loved your to
pping and didn't really want to abort but
fuck it what's one more lie to tell our un

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pineapple on a
