[Verse 1]
just a pineapple on a pizza town girl liv
she took the midnight train goin' anywhere
just a pizza topping born and raised in hawai
it's sweet and tangy goin' anywhere go

[Verse 2]
a pineapple in a pizza
smell of cheese and tomato sau
for a flavor they can share the
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the pizza box
their toppings searchin' in the night
cheese and sauce and
livin' just to find flavor hide
somewhere in the night hide hide

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get my slice
everybody wants a to
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more to

[Verse 4]
some will win some will lose
some are born to be a to
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the pizza box
their toppings searchin' in the night
cheese and sauce and
livin' just to find flavor hide
somewhere in the night hide hide

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop savorin
hold on to that flavor
pizza toppings
don't stop savorin
hold on
pizza toppings
don't stop savorin
hold on to that flavor
pizza toppings
