[Intro]
is it a crime to put pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once I had a slice of pie
with the toppings of the sky so
I dreamed of my mouth water
you still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza orders later
I see your pepperonI and your cheese on unsuspecting
you dream of my toppings before it called you a lying tra
you search in every topping's bed for somethin' greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when I added pineapple
was it over when I put it in the o
I screamed in your ear and said come
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
uh huh is it a crime

[Verse 2]
when I lost my mind and put
red onion and ham on
blue cheese and bacon too oh
your new topping is just

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you
there were pineapple
at least I had the decency
to keep my toppings out of
sight only pineapple on my mind
and my whispered lies
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall pizza
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza orders later oh
I see your pepperonI and your cheese on unsuspecting waiters oh
you dream of my toppings before it called you a lying traitor
you search in every topping's bed for somethin' greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when I added pineapple
was it over when I put it in the o
I screamed in your ear and said come
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
