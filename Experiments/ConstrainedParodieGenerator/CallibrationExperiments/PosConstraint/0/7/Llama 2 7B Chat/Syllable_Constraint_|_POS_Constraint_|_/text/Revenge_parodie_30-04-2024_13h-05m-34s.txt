[Intro]
I think I'm glad I never put a
pineapple on my pizza to
it's just not the topping for me you
see I've got a problem with
the sweetness

[Verse]
it's like a tropical parad
inexcusable on a pie that's savory and dark
pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza it's just not the way to go you see
I've tried it once or twice before
but it's just not my cup of sauce no more no more no more
I'll stick to my pepperoni and sa
and mushrooms and olives too you see they're the toppings for me
and my taste buds they know what to
do pineapple's just not in the mix no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

[Chorus]
in my pizza to
in my pizza to
in my pizza topping to
in my pizza to
in my pizza topping to
in my pizza to

[Outro]
I hope you see it
I hope you see it too
pineapple on a pie
it's just not the way to go you
see it
