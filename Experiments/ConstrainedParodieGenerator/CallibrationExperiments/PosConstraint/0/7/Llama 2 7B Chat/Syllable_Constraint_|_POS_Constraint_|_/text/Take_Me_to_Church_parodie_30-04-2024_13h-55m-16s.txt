[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie
it's a crime against humanity
can't you see it's a sinful sight
disrupting the delicate flav
of the savory delightful
chewing away with all
our teeth in unison like a
herd of wild animals
but pineapple doesn't belong on
pizza it's a travesty of
gastronomical proportions a
culinary atrocity of
epic proportions a dis
gastronomical catastrop
pheasant of the food world

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no oh

[Chorus]
don't put the
pineapple on the pizza it's a crime against
humanity don't you know it's a sinful
sight disrupting the delic
ate of the savory flavor che
ing away with
all our teeth in unison like a herd of
wild animals but pineapple doesn't belong
on pizza it's a travest
of gastronomical proportions

[Verse 2]
it's a abomination of the
highest order a sac
rilegious affront to the cul
inary gods a profane
deviation from the holy gra
of pizza toppings a blasphem
ous desecration of the
sacred art of pizza craft
ing a mockery of the fin

pineapple on the pizza it's a crime against
humanity don't you know it's a sinful
sight disrupting the delic
ate of the savory flavor che
ing away with
all our teeth in unison like a herd of
wild animals but pineapple doesn't belong
on pizza it's a travest
of gastronomical proportions

[Bridge]
we implore you to reconsider your topping
choices and respect the culinary traditions of
the past a pizza is not a blank canvas to
be adorned with any fruit that takes your fancy a

[Pre-Chorus]
