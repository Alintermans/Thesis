[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain it clear
it doesn't belong there

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to collect my thought before I
start to rant about this ab
horrent topping that they dare
to call a pizza topping
do you even read the menu
or do you just ignore the rules
when you ordered a pepper
oni and sausage too was I even on your
radar I knew when I saw you take a
bite of that hawaiian monstrosity you'd do the opposite of
what you said you'd do and claim
it's a delicacy and
I'd end up more irate don't say it isn't fair
you clearly weren't aware that

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain it clear it doesn't bel
ong there I wish it wasn't true mm mm verse two you call me up
drunk from a party bragging

[Verse 2]
about your fancy pizza that you
paid a premium for a topping
that ruins the flavor and the texture and
the smell it's like a nightmare that I can
t wake up from and you don
't relate to me I don't want
to relate to you either cause
you re ruining pizza

[Verse 3]
and I don't post about it online so don't think
I m talking shit about you behind
your back cause that s not my style I just want to
make it clear that pineapple has no place on
a pie and don't waste my time trying
to convince me otherwise I could
go on and on about the toppings that are actually
good but that would be a waste of breath cause you never
listen anyway and don't try to make me feel bad
cause I ve moved on from your pineapple lies

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
you said it was just a misunder
standing but now it s too
late just leave me and my pizza alone
ye
ah god
dam
n it
fuck you
