[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I protest against it

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
the abomination on
top of my pizza pie oh the horror
the thought of it makes me feel
like I'm in a nightmare can
we please just keep it simple and avoid the
combination of sweet and
savory that just doesn't belong
it's like someone took a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich and

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza the way
it was meant to be e

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the logic in putting
fruit on a beautiful pie crust and che
ese please tell me who thought this was
a good idea
I cannot fathom why anyone would do
this to a perfectly good
pizza it's like taking a
masterpiece and painting mustaches
on the mona lisa why must
you ruin something so pure
can't we just stick to pepperoni
and mushrooms and on

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't ruin your pizza with pineapple
already the voice in
my head is screaming don
t do it don't do it don't do it
please don't do it don
t do it don't do

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't ruin your pizza with pineapple
already the voice in
my head is screaming don
t do it don't do it don't do it
please don't do it don
t do it don't do
don't waste your time on pineapple pizza
you're already the voice
inside my head is begg
ing you don't do it don't do it don
t do it please don't
do it don't do it

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza the way
it was meant to be e
I miss pizza the way
it was meant to be e
