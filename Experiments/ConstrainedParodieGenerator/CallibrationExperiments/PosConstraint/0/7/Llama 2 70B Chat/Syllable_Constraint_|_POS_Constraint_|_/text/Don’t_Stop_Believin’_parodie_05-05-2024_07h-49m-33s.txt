just a pizza pie sitin' in the oven ton
a topping so wrong it's like a crime scene gone

[Verse 2]
a taste of hawaii in the
middle of italy it's just
a confusion of flavors it
makes no sense it's just not right ight ight

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waitin
up and down the menu list
their flavors searchin in the night
pizza lovers
livin just to find a slice that
tastes just right ight ight ight ight

[Verse 3]
workin hard to make a pie
that's perfect and divine but
pineapple just don't fit the bill
it's a crime it

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
hate it some are born to eat
anchovies oh the pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waitin
up and down the menu list
their flavors searchin in the night
pizza lovers
livin just to find a slice that
tastes just right ight ight ight ight

pizza lovers
