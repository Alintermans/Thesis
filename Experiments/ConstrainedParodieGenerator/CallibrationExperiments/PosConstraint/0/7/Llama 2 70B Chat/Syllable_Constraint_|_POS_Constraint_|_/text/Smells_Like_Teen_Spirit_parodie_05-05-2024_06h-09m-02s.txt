[Verse 1]
load up on toppings, bring your
it's fun to choose and to pretend
that pineapple has a place on a pie
oh no I know it's a crime pre

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less tasty
here we are now ruining the
flavor of a classic dish so
tasteless tasteless tasteless how low
a pineapple an anchor a
pineapple a disaster a

[Post-Chorus]
yeah hey ye

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at pizza than you
and for this mistake I feel
blessed our taste buds have always been
ruined and always will until

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less tasty
here we are now ruining the
flavor of a classic dish so
tasteless tasteless tasteless how low
a pineapple an anchor a
pineapple a disaster a

[Post-Chorus]
yeah hey ye

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I eat
oh yeah I guess it makes me sick
I found it hard it's hard to find
oh well whatever never mind

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less tasty
here we are now ruining the
flavor of a classic dish so
tasteless tasteless tasteless how low
a pineapple an anchor a
pineapple a disaster a
