[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up and declare

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory cravings gam
we're ordering up a pie getting lost in
autumn nights falling down like anchovies on the
and I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that flavor's not here no more
and I might be okay but my taste buds are not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost ordered pepperoni cause you were looking at
me wind in my hair I was
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza on the menu counter your eyes
were scanning for something new and exciting in a twin sized bed and
your mother's telling stories bout you on the pepperoni
team you told me bout your cravings thinking your future
was me and you were tossing me the slice keys fuck the calzone
keychain on the ground we were always skipping town
and I was thinking on the drive down any time now
he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it was
til we were dead and gone and e
aten check the pulse and come back swearing it
s the same after three months
in the grave and then you wondered where It went to as I
reached for you but all I felt was cheese and you held me

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light down the stairs I was
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
ath sacred prayer and we
d swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lie
ing here cause I remember it

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my taste
you said if we had been closer in toppings maybe it would have been
fine and that made me want to
die the idea you had of me who was
she a never needy ever lovely pizza whose shine reflects on you
not weeping in a party bathroom
some pizza delivery guy asking
me what happened you
that's what happened you you who charmed my taste bud
s with self effacing toppings sipping coffee
like you're on a late night show but then he watched me watch the front door
all night willing you to come and he said it's supposed to

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my toppings and I walk home a
lone but you keep my old slice of pizza from that
very first week cause it reminds you of innocence
and it smells like me you can
t get rid of it cause you remem

[Chorus]
ber it all too well yeah cause there we are
again when I loved you so back before you lost the
one real thing you've ever
known It was rare I was there I
remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were
there you remember it
all down the stairs you were
there you remember it
all It was rare I was there I

[Verse 6]
I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes I
ll get older but your pizza stays my age
from when your pepperoni broke my heart
and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half
my weight and did the oven burn paint
you blue just between us did the love affair ma
im you too cause in this town
's barren cold I still remember the first
fall of cheese and how it glistened
as it fell I remember it

[Outro]
all too well just between us did the love affair maim you
all too well just between us do you remember it
all too well just between us I remember it all too well wind
in my hair you were there you were there down
the stairs you were there you remember
it all it was rare you remember
it all too well wind in my hair you were there
you were there down the stairs you were there you
remember it all it was rare you
remember it all too well wind in
my hair you were there you were there
down the stairs you were there you remember
it all it was rare you remember
it all too well wind in my hair you
were there you were there down the stag
es you were there you remember it all
it was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair you were there
you were there down the stairs you were there you rem

[Spoken Outro]
