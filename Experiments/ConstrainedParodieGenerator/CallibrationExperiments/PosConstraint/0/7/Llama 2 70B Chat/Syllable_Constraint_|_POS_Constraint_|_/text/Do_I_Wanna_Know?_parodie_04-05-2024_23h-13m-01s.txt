[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' with glee every bite you take
do you ever get that feelin' that it
just don't belong like a fruit
that's not supposed to be savory and
sticks out like a sore thumb like a hawaiian pizza
are there some flavors up your sle
that you're tryin' to
hide from me have you no Idea that It's just not right I
dream of pizza with real toppings nearly ev'ry

[Pre-Chorus]
night this week how many toppings can you add on
'cause there's this pizza that I found that makes me think of you
and I play it on repeat until I'm full and
satisfied spillin' drinks on my settee pizza that flows

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to bas
ever thought of callin' when
you're hungry for
real pizza cause
I always do
maybe I'm too bus
bein' a pizza snob to
fall for somethin
new now I've thought it

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been wonderin' if your pizza's still great
and if so I wanna know what toppings it
features simmer down and savor the flavor don't you
interrupt it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of try
in' to taste the real deal but I don't know if you
feel the same as I do but we could be eatin

[Pre-Chorus]
night this week how many toppings can you add on
'cause there's this pizza that I found that makes me think of you
and I play it on repeat until I'm full and
satisfied spillin' drinks on my settee pizza that flows

[Chorus]
together if you wanted to crawlin
back to basics ever thought
of callin' when you're hungry
for real pizza cause I always do
maybe I'm too bus bein' a pizza
snob to fall for somethin' new now
I've thought it through crawlin' back
to basics pizza
basics pizza that

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this feelin' flows both
ways sad to see you go was sorta hopin' that you
stay baby we both know that pineapple don't
belong on pizza and that's just the way it is do
I wanna know too busy bein' a pizza pur
ist to fall for somethin' new sad to see you go e
ver thought of callin' darlin' do you want me crawlin' back
