[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolhardy foodie
been a pizza purist all
my taste buds need a pineapple detox feel it washing off
well little pizza I don't want to admit to this
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my cravings now are falling like the
rain so let the pizza

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's coming home with his stomach growling to
catch some flack for his last pizza
sweat pants and dress shirts mismatched on his
breath's jack he's a pepperoni addict and she
just wants to exact revenge and get back it's a
chess match she's on his back like a jetpack
she's kept track of all his pizza toppings and guess who just
happens to be moving on to the next slice actually just shut
up my last pizza and she
has what my ex lacks cause she loves anchovies psychopath
and you don't fuck with no man's pizza even
I know that but she's devised some plan to cut the toppings
knife in hand says their pizza's hang
in by a string so she's been on the web lately says
maybe she'll be my hawaiian pizza to spite her man and I
know she's using me to try to play him I
don't care hi pineapple but I should

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolhardy foodie
been a pizza purist all
my taste buds need a pineapple detox feel it washing off
well little pizza I don't want to admit to this
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my cravings now are falling like the
rain so let the pizza

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one pizza stand turned into a two
night stand it was come sunlight scram now we hug tight
and he found out now she feels deserted and
used cause he left so what he did it first to
her too now how am I supposed to tell this girl that
we're through it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous
and sue don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is
the truth don't take it personal I just can't say this in person
to you so I revert to the studio like hole in the wall din
ers don't have to be reserved in a
booth I just feel like the person who I'm turning in
to's irreversible I preyed on you like it's church at the
pew and now that I got you I don't want
you took advantage in my thirst to purs
ue why do I do this dirt that I
do get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and
speech detergent and bleach is burnin' the
wound cause now with her in
the womb we can't bring her in this world should
have knew to use protection before I bit into your forb
idd

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolhardy foodie
been a pizza purist all
my taste buds need a pineapple detox feel it washing off
well little pizza I don't want to admit to this
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my cravings now are falling like the
rain so let the pizza

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride he
fuck can I say if life was a highway
and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in five lan
es speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin' on ice ma
ybe that's why I may have came at you side
ways I can't keep my lies
straight but I made you terminate my anch
ovy this love triangle left us in a reck
tangled what else can I say it was fun for
a while bet I really woulda loved
your smile didn't really wanna abort but
fuck it what's one more lie to tell our un

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a foolhardy foodie
been a pizza purist all
my taste buds need a pineapple detox feel it washing off
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
s gonna cause is pain the truth
and my lies now are falling like the rain so let
the pizza run pizza
