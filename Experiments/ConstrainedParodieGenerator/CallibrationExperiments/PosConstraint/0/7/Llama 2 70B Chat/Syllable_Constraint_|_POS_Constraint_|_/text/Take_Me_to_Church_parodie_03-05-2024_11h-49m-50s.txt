[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the pineapple on top that's the
problem ain't no way to hide it
I should've known better than to
ever put it on my pie in
the first place but now it
stays there mocking me with its sweetness
and its prickly little
spiky texture that just don't feel
right on my tongue like a lie on
sunday morning when I'm trying to
be good but my cravings they just won
t go away no matter
how hard I try to fight it take
me to the pizzería

[Pre-Chorus]
amen to
the pineapple

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzería where the pineapple's banned from the top
I'll worship the pepperoni like a dog at
the shrine of your lies I'll tell
you my cravings and you can offer
me something that
tastes right oh good pizza let me give you my life
take me to the pizzería where the pineapple
can't be found I'
ll worship the pepperoni like

[Verse 2]
a dog at the shrine of your lies to
keep the taste buds on your
side she demands a sacrifice
of that pineapple abom
ination that's been plaguing my taste
buds for far too long drain the whole
soda get something bubbly
something meaty for the main
course that's a fine lookin' pie what
you got in the kitchen we've got
a lot of starvin

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzería where the pineapple's banned from the top
I'll worship the pepperoni like a dog at
the shrine of your lies I'll tell
you my cravings and you can offer
me something that
tastes right oh good pizza let me give you my life
take me to the pizzería where the pineapple
can't be found I'll worship
the pepperoni like a dog at

[Bridge]
the shrine of your lies in the madness and soil of
that sad pizza scene only then I am human only
then I am clean no pineapple in sight only
the way it should be no masters or kings when the hung

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzería where the pineapple's banned from the top
I'll worship the pepperoni like a dog at
the shrine of your lies I'll tell
you my cravings and you can offer
me something that
tastes right oh good pizza let me give you my life
take me to the pizzería where the pineapple
can't be found I'
ll worship the pepperoni like
