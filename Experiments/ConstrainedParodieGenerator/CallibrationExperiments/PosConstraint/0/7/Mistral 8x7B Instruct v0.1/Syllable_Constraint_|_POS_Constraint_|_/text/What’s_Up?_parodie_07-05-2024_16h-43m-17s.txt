[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I realized quickly when I took a bite
that pineapple's a culprit that just doesn't fit right
it's time to set things straight

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I see it on the
pizza that I'm going to devour
and I think to myself with disgust and power
and I wake in the morning and I open the box
and I take a deep breath and I try not to
gag from the taste of this abomber
and I say to

[Chorus]
myself oh no no no
no no no
I said oh no no no no no
to myself oh no no
no no no
I said oh no no no no no

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh oh oh
oh oh
oh
oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
and I fight
oh my god do I fight
I fight all the time
against this disgusting
and I pray
oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
for a better way

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I see it on the
pizza that I'm going to devour
and I think to myself with disgust and power
and I wake in the morning and I open the box
and I take a deep breath and I try not to
gag from the taste of this abomber
and I say to

[Chorus]
myself oh no no no
no no no
I said oh no no no no
to myself oh no no
no no no
I said oh no no no no no
and I say to myself
oh no no no no no no no no
oh no no
and I say to myself oh no no
no no no
oh no no no no no no no
oh no no no no no
oh no no no no no no no no
oh no no no no
oh no no no no no no no no
oh no no
oh no no no no no no no

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh oh oh

[Outro]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate fare
