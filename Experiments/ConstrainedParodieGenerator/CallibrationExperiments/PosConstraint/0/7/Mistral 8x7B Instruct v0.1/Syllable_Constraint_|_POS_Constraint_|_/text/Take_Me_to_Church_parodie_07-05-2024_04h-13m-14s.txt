[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go consent of the
masses I don't know why they'd choose
it on a pie it's an abuse
if the gods of taste did speak up
they would surely shake their
heads and say it's time to give it up
it's just not meant to be
we were raised right we know the way it
should be with cheese and pepperonie
I say no to pineapple on a
pizza pie it's just not okay to
mix the sweet and savory
command me to keep it normal
keep the pineapple off

[Pre-Chorus]
ay caram
ba yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
take me to a
better pizza place where pineapple's not allowed
I'll tell you my order and you can take a bow
offer me a slice of real
good pizza pie oh good god let me
take a bite of
take me to a better pizza place where pineap
ple's not allowed I'll tell you my order and you
can take a bow offer me
a slice of real good pizza pie oh

[Verse 2]
if I'm a lover of the classic
toppings I don't want
no fruit on my pizza pie it
just doesn't belong with ham
and bacon it's a waste of time and
space it's just not worth the fight it
looks out of place on a pie
that's meant to be savory
we've got so many other to
ppings to choose from it's a shame to
waste our time on

[Chorus]
take me to a
better pizza place where pineapple's not allowed
I'll tell you my order and you can take a bow
offer me a slice of real
good pizza pie oh good god let me
take a bite of
take me to a better pizza place where pineap
ple's not allowed I'll tell you my order and you
can take a bow offer me
a slice of real good pizza pie oh

[Bridge]
no pineapple allowed when the pizza's made right
it's just not the same it's lost its light without it on top
in the madness of the kitchen scene only then
I am satisfied only then I am happy with

[Pre-Chorus]
ay caramba
yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
take me to a
better pizza place where pineapple's not allowed
I'll tell you my order and you can take a bow
offer me a slice of real
good pizza pie oh good god let me
take a bite of
take me to a better pizza place where pineap
ple's not allowed I'll tell you my order and you
can take a bow offer me
a slice of real good pizza pie oh
