[Intro]
come on now folks and give an ear to me a tale

[Verse 1]
taste sensation
pineapple's not a valid
option for a pizza topping please believe
it just doesn't fit the blend we
need to make a
gourmet meal and not a travest
y so let's just leave it be
and not put it on our pizza pie

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
call the chef and
tell him to forget the pine
apple chunks upon my pizza crusts it
just don't make no sense it
clashes with the
savory flavors we all know
and love so well it's just a
no go for this tasty dish we hold so dear

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
stay in your lane ham and pepperoni
I don't wanna hear about your pineapple ob
session leave the fruit for your fruit salad
and not on my pizza pie it's just a big no no

[Outro]
he
y it's not
he same as it was he y it's not
he same as it was he
