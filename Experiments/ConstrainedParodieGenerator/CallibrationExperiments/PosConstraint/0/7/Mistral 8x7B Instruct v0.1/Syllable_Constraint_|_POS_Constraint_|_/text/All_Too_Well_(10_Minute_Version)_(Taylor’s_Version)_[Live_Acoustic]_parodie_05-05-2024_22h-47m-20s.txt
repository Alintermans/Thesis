[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my appetite at the table
that monstrosity should not be allowed now

[Verse 2]
oh that sweet and savory clash of flavors so wrong
the ham and pineapple duet in my mouth
autumn leaves of disappointment falling down like
a bad dream after which I woke up with a

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that culinary sin is
a blight on my tongue forevermore oh oh oh
it's a crime

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on that slice of hell
a pineapple disaster waiting to unravel itself
soggy crust and I was there
I regret it all too well oh

[Verse 3]
toppings scattered on the counter in despair and griefed
you used to be a fan of classic pepperoni in bedding sheets
and your mother's telling stories of you at pizza parties
you told me about your past cravings thinking your pal
ate was me but you were wrong and now you see oh oh oh oh
the error of your pineapple ways oh oh oh
and you were tossing me the slice but I declined with
a firm no and I was thinking on the drive home oh no
why did I ever think that pine
apple could belong on pizza anyway
check the taste and come back cur
sing it's the same after just one bite oh no no no no
and then you wondered where the flavor went to as you

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it long enough
to forget why I ever tried

[Chorus]
cause there it was again in the middle of the
night a pineapple abomination waiting to strike me
down I was there I reg
ret it all too well oh oh oh
and there it was again when nobody had to know
you kept it a secret but I knew it was a sin oh
no sacred prayer and we
'd swear to never eat it again oh

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you topped it all with
pineapple running scared
I was there I remember it
all too well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time I think of pineapple
on pizza it makes me want to yell and scream and shout oh oh oh oh
and did the pineapple to
pping pain you too oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to forget that taste but it lingers still oh oh oh oh oh
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now I spit it out and I walk home alone oh
but you keep my old scarf from that very first bite
'cause it reminds you of a culinary mistake and
it smells like pineapple oh
you can't get rid of it oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it was again when I hated
you so back before I knew the truth about pineap
please oh oh oh oh oh
I regret it all too well oh
and there it was again when
I loved you so back when
I was still under your
spells oh oh oh oh oh
I regret it all too
well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at hiding my disgust but the punch
line goes oh no not again oh no oh no
from when your pineapple ruined my life
I'm a warrior who's returning half her
weight oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
and did the pineapple destroy your soul too oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
just between us oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro]
I hate you guys so much oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
