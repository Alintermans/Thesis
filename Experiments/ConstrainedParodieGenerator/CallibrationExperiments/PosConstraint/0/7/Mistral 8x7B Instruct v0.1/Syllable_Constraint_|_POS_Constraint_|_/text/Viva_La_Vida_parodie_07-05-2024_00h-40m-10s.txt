[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice foot
now in the morning I take a bite
of a pizza that just ain

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to love the taste
but now it's ruined by the pineap
stuck in every bite like
a thorn in my side I can't escape
one bite in and I feel bet
the sweetness turned to regret
and I discovered that my crust is soft
upon a base of bad taste alofted high

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
pineapple lovers singing their song
be my savory topping and
my cheesy goodness all along oh how
for some reason I can't explain
once you added pineapple
it was never the same
and that was when I said no to

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a tropical and wrong
bringing down the flavor of the
pepperoni and sausage that once
was right but now is gone aw who would want
pineapple on their pizza
when it just don't belong here
just a topping on a lonely pie aw no
who would ever want pineapple on

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
pineapple lovers singing their song
be my savory topping and
my cheesy goodness all along oh how
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest slice
but that was when I said no to

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no no no no no
oh no no no no no
oh no no no no no
oh no no no no no

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no no no no no
hear the bells of disappointment ring
pineapple lovers still
be my savory topping and the
cheesy goodness all gone
for some reason I can't expl
I know saint peter won
never an honest slice but that was when
I said no to pineap
on my pizza slice oh no no no
no to pineapple on
my pizza slice oh no no no no no
no to pineapple on
my pizza slice oh no no no

[Outro]
mmm no mmm no
mmm no mmm no
mmm no
