[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue and mad
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just shouldn't be

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a parody verse
to tell you why it's such a
faux pas to put pineapple
on a pizza you adore it
but I'm here to set it straight for
you and others like you who
don't know any better yet don't say it
isn't true it's just a fact that it's a
travesty on a pizza pie don't you see it too yeah you do
and I know you'll come around
to my way of thinking soon
cause it's just not right to put pineapple on pizza
it's a crime that's plain to see so

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue and
mad wish I could explain it clearer but it just shouldn
't be true mmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmm
hmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmh

[Verse 2]
you top your pizza high with pineap
please stop the insanity it's a
travesty to pizza lovers like me you
scared me to death with your choice of toppings
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
cause I'd never put pineapple
on a pizza it's just not

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about pizza on the net cause
it's a given that it's delicious and
pineapple has no place on it never told a
soul that pineapple belongs on pizza it
just doesn't make any sense it's a dis
grace to pizza lovers all around
the world so don't waste your time trying to convince me that
it's a good idea cause I won't change my mind
never paid any mind to the haters of pineapple
on pizza so I shut them all out cause they

[Outro]
ruined my enjoyment of
pizza forever always said it
was misunderstood made all
my pizza moments sour just leave me
al
one yeah
ah
goddam
ahhah
