[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
its taste is a curseakkari
on a classic pie it shouldna
on a classic pie it shouldna

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare tell me it's a delicacy
it's a travesty and
a mockery of culinary
a mockery of culinar

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on pies that were true
tomato sauce and mozzarella
but pineapple just won't do
its sweetness ruins the flavora flavoraflav
its sweetness ruins the flavor
taking away from the pizza
leaving a bad taste in my mouth
a bad taste in my mouthy mouth

[Chorus]
painstakingly crafted slices of
heaven defiled with
pineapple's a sinful addition
to a classic dish that
deserves no inclusion oh no no no no
my heart breaks for the pizzas that have
been tainted by this monstrosity
no no no no no no

[Verse 3]
third things third
send your prayers to the pizza gods up
high to spare us from this
abomination up high up up up
abomination up high up

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on pies that were
made with love and devotiona
pineapple ruins the whole thing
leaving a bad taste in my mouth
a bad taste in my mouthy mouthy mouthy mouthy
inhibiting the true essence of pizza oh no no no
my heart breaks for

[Chorus]
painstakingly crafted slices of
heaven defiled with
pineapple's a sinful addition
to a classic dish that
deserves no inclusion oh no no no no
my heart breaks for the pizzas that have
been tainted by this monstrosity
no no no no no no

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the pizza gods above
pineapple's got no place on
a classic pie that we love
a classic pie that we love

[Pre-Chorus]
inhibiting the true essence of pizza oh no
my heart breaks for the pizzas that have been tainted by this mon
strosity no

[Chorus]
painstakingly crafted slices of
heaven defiled with
pineapple's a sinful addition
to a classic dish that
