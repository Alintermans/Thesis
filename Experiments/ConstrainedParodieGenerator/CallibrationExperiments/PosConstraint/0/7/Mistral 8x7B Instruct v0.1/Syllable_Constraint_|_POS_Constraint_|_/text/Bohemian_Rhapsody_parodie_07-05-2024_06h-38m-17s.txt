[Intro]
is this a bad meal or just a fantasy
caught in a dilemma with no escape from this fall
open your eyes and take a bite and seeeuhhhy
I'm just a poor guy who craves a different
topping on my pie instead of pineapple's bitter stingy
any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to meeeeuhhhyyuhhhy

[Verse 1]
mamaaaaahhhhhh just killed my meal
put pineapple on it and now it's just not reallehhhy
mamaaaaahhhhh life had just begun
but now I've gone and thrown it all away
mamaaaaahhhhh didn't mean to ruin your day
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my time has come
sends shivers down my spine body's aching all the time
goodbye everybody I've got to go
gotta leave you all behind and taste the truth
mamaaaaahhhhh I don't wanna eat this
I sometimes wish I'd just
avoided this monstrosity called pizza

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little slice of pizza with pine
scaramouche scaramouche will you do the fandango
thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
galileo galileo galileo galileo figaro magnifico x repetit
but I'm just a poor guy who craves a better
topping on my pizza instead of pineap
please spare me this monstrosity x repe
easy come easy go will you let me go
bismillah no we will not let you go
let him go bismillah we will not let you go
let him go bismillah we will not let you go
let me go will not let you go
let me go will not let you go
never never never never let me go ah
no no no no no no no
oh mamma mia mamma mia mamma mia let me go
beelzebub has a devil put aside for meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

[Verse 4]
so you think you can stone me and spit in my
face and tell me pineapple on pizza is nice
oh baby can't do this to me baby
just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]

nothing really matters anyone can see
nothing really matters
nothing really matters to me
any way the wind blow
