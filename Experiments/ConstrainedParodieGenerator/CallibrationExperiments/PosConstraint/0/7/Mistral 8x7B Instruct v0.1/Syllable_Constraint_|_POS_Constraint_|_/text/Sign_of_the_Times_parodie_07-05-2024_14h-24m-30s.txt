on a slice so divine and

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before and found it a

the pineapple pain don
we've tasted before and found it a

the pineapple plague on

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice with a smile on

mistake to adorn our pizza with
the pineapple pain don

it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from this crime we gotta
get away from this monstrosity we gotta
get away from this travesty
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
