And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it, I desp\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nplease forego\nthe pineapple on pizza\nit's a travesty to savoring true\na culinary abom\nination in the oven\nwe can savor better toppings instead here\nwith pepperoni or sa\nusage will delight us more than pine\napple e'er could inspire us to cheer\nwe'll wish this never ends\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it, I desp\nI despise pineapple\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere's the ham that once resided\non pizza pies before this fad began\nit's lost its place and purpose here\nand now the taste is\ntainted by this sweet intrusion no one asked\nfor in the first place and now\nthe pizza's ruined by this\nunholy union of sweet and sav\nory that was never meant to\nexist upon a pizza\nwill you come to your senses and stop this\ntrend tonight stop this\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't waste your time on pineapple you're just\nruining pizza night\nI despise it I desp\n\ndon't waste your time on pineapple you're just\nruining pizza night\nI despise it I desp\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't waste your time on pineapple you're just\nruining pizza night\nI despise it I desp\n\ndon't waste your time on pineapple you're just\nruining pizza night\nI despise it I desp\n\ndon't waste your time on pineapple you're just\nruining pizza night\nI despise it I desp\n\ndon't waste your time on pineapple you're just\nruining pizza night\nI despise it I desp\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it I desp\nI despise pineapple\nI despise it I desp\n",
