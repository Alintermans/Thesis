[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
please forego
the pineapple on pizza
it's a travesty to savoring true
a culinary abom
ination in the oven
we can savor better toppings instead here
with pepperoni or sa
usage will delight us more than pine
apple e'er could inspire us to cheer
we'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp
I despise pineapple

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the ham that once resided
on pizza pies before this fad began
it's lost its place and purpose here
and now the taste is
tainted by this sweet intrusion no one asked
for in the first place and now
the pizza's ruined by this
unholy union of sweet and sav
ory that was never meant to
exist upon a pizza
will you come to your senses and stop this
trend tonight stop this

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're just
ruining pizza night
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time on pineapple you're just
ruining pizza night
I despise it I desp

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're just
ruining pizza night
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time on pineapple you're just
ruining pizza night
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time on pineapple you're just
ruining pizza night
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time on pineapple you're just
ruining pizza night
I despise it I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise pineapple
I despise it I desp
I despise pineapple
