[Verse]
emerging from my denial and I've been doing
just fine without pineapple on my pizza pie
started out a classic way but then it went awry ol
lah lah lah lah lah lah lah
now I'm pushing food away and my taste buds sigh
as I see it on the menu and I start to
cry and wonder why it's even on the list at
all it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're putting it on now
it's ruining my dish
let me be
and I just can't bear it it's killing
my appetite and

[Chorus]
jealousy of those who can enjoy it
swimming through a sea of dis
gust but I just can't ab
ide it's just the price I pay
tragedy is calling me
open up my bitter eyes
cause I'm mr no

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
emerging from my denial and I've been doing fine
without pineapple on my pizza pie it's a
shame that it's included on the menu when it doesn't
belong lah lah lah lah lah lah lah lah lah la
now I'm pushing food away and my taste buds sigh
as I see it on the table and I start to
cry and wonder why it's even here at all it
's all in my head olence

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're putting it on now
it's ruining my dish
let me be
and I just can't bear it it's kill
ing my appetite

[Chorus]
jealousy of those who can enjoy it
swimming through a sea of dis
gust but I just can't ab
ide it's just the price I pay
tragedy is calling me
open up my bitter eyes
cause I'm mr no

[Guitar Solo]


[Outro]
I never
