He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine line gotta\ndraw the line before it's drowned in pineapple supreme time to\nspeak up and say no way it's just not okay on a slice\nwell little one I don't want\nto admit to something if all it's gonna cause\nis disgust let the truth\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's coming home with a slice in hand to catch\nflack sweat jackets and jeans mismatched\non his plate a mess of pineapple\nand ham he's a strange snacker she just wants to take\na stand and say no way to this monstrosity\nit's a travesty she's been tracking all\nthe places he's been taking his pineapple addiction\nand now she's plotting revenge on this abomination so she's been\non the web lately saying\nmaybe she'll start a petition to banish pineapple\nand I know she's using me to try to sway him\nI don't care hI suzanne but I shoulda said bye suz\nanne after the first bite but now\nI'm in too deep and I can't stop thinking about\nthe taste of pineapple on pizza and it's driving me insane\nsuzanne come back I take it all back I was\nwrong to ever think pineapple on a\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine line gotta\ndraw the line before it's drowned in pineapple supreme time to\nspeak up and say no way it's just not okay on a slice\nwell little one I don't want\nto admit to something if all it's gonna cause\nis disgust let the truth\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one night stand turned a two night stand it\nwas come morning time scram now we hug tight and he\nfound out now she feels taken advantage of\nand used he left so what he did it first to\nher too now how am I supposed to tell this girl that\nwe're through it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous\nand scared so I revert to the studio like hole in\nthe wall diners don't have to be reserved in a booth I just feel like\nthe person who I'm turning into's irreversible I preyed on\nyou like it's church at the pew and now that\nI got you I don't want you took advantage in\nmy thirst to pursue why do I do this dirt that I do got\non my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech\ndetergent and bleach is burning the wound\ncause now with her in the womb we can\ntell her the truth about pineapple on pizza\nand hope that she understands that it's just\nnot meant to be on a\nslice of pizza so let the river run and\nlet the truth be told about pineapple on pizza it's just\nnot\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's river my name\nsays no\nto\npineapple\non pizza let the ri\nver run call me river we'll let the\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the bridesmaid never the bride hey\nfuck can I say if life was a highway\nand pineapple was a crime I'd be swerving in\nfive lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice\nmaybe that's why I may have came at you\nsideways I can't keep these\nlies straight but I made you try pineapple\nand now I'm sorry for the abomination\nthis love triangle left us in a wreck tang\nled what else can I say it was fun\nfor a while but now I'm over it and it\n's time to say goodbye to pineapple on a\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine line gotta\ndraw the line before it's drowned in pineapple supreme time to\nspeak up and say\nno way it\n\n's just not okay on a slice well little\none I don\n\n't want to admit to something if\nall it's gonna cause is disgust let the truth and\n",
