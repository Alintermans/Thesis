[Intro]
I think I've had it now with pine on
that cheesy dish you call a fe
I'm through with this debate on taste bud
I think it's time to set things
straight for good

[Verse]
I've tasted two pies before this
can't pretend that I enjoyed it one bit oh my word
the thought of pineapple on pizza
if I could change it all back would I even
miss it at all well broken taste
buds break tradition so leave it all behind me I don
't wanna give in to this trend so in the
trash it goes I'll stand my ground and say no more to this sinful
pairing of sweet and savory
I've tasted two pies before this can't pretend that I
enjoyed it one bit oh my word the
thought of pineapple on pizza if I could
change it all back would I even
miss it at all well broken taste buds break tradition so
leave it all behind me I don't want
to give in to this trend so in the trash it goes I'll standmy

[Chorus]
in the trash it goes
in the trash it goes
in the trash it goes go go
in the trash it goes
in the trash it goes go go
in the trash it goes

[Outro]
in the trash it goes
it goes it goes it goes
is your craving worth the
tradition lost forevermore
enjoy
