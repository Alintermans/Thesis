[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and tom
just a pineapple chunk trying to find its place
on a pizza pie where it just don't fit

[Verse 2]
a topping in a greasy box
with ham and pineapple in the
search for a slice to call its own
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights glow
their slices searchin' in the night
for a topping
that doesn't belong on pizza
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get my fill
payin' extra for this or
just to try something new again and
again and oh

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
some are born to sing the blues
oh the taste sensation is
just so wrong it goes on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights glow
their slices searchin' in the night
for a topping
that doesn't belong on pizza
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating it
keep on denying it
pizza lovers
don't stop hating it
keep on
pizza lovers
don't stop hating it
keep on denying it
pizza lovers
