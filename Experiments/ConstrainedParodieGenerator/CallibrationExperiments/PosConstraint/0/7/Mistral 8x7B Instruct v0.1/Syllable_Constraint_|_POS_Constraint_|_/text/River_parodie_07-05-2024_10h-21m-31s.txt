[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine line gotta
draw the line before it's drowned in pineapple supreme time to
speak up and say no way it's just not okay on a slice
well little one I don't want
to admit to something if all it's gonna cause
is disgust let the truth

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's coming home with a slice in hand to catch
flack sweat jackets and jeans mismatched
on his plate a mess of pineapple
and ham he's a strange snacker she just wants to take
a stand and say no way to this monstrosity
it's a travesty she's been tracking all
the places he's been taking his pineapple addiction
and now she's plotting revenge on this abomination so she's been
on the web lately saying
maybe she'll start a petition to banish pineapple
and I know she's using me to try to sway him
I don't care hI suzanne but I shoulda said bye suz
anne after the first bite but now
I'm in too deep and I can't stop thinking about
the taste of pineapple on pizza and it's driving me insane
suzanne come back I take it all back I was
wrong to ever think pineapple on a

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine line gotta
draw the line before it's drowned in pineapple supreme time to
speak up and say no way it's just not okay on a slice
well little one I don't want
to admit to something if all it's gonna cause
is disgust let the truth

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand it
was come morning time scram now we hug tight and he
found out now she feels taken advantage of
and used he left so what he did it first to
her too now how am I supposed to tell this girl that
we're through it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous
and scared so I revert to the studio like hole in
the wall diners don't have to be reserved in a booth I just feel like
the person who I'm turning into's irreversible I preyed on
you like it's church at the pew and now that
I got you I don't want you took advantage in
my thirst to pursue why do I do this dirt that I do got
on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burning the wound
cause now with her in the womb we can
tell her the truth about pineapple on pizza
and hope that she understands that it's just
not meant to be on a
slice of pizza so let the river run and
let the truth be told about pineapple on pizza it's just
not

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if life was a highway
and pineapple was a crime I'd be swerving in
five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice
maybe that's why I may have came at you
sideways I can't keep these
lies straight but I made you try pineapple
and now I'm sorry for the abomination
this love triangle left us in a wreck tang
led what else can I say it was fun
for a while but now I'm over it and it
's time to say goodbye to pineapple on a

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine line gotta
draw the line before it's drowned in pineapple supreme time to
speak up and say
no way it
's just not okay on a slice well little
one I don
't want to admit to something if
all it's gonna cause is disgust let the truth and
my lies now are falling
