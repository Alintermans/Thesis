[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clings like something in
the middle of your slice where it
should be cheese and pepperoni or ham
have you no idea that it's a culinary
disaster waiting to unfold
'cause there's this dish I found
that makes me think of food fights an' I cook it on repeat till
it's cold and soggy spilling sauce on my carpet

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this combo's a mistake
were you hopin' for a classic pizza makeover
baby we both know that the nights were made for che
sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day at

[Chorus]
scrapin' back to pine
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
addicted to this
to fall for a pizza that
now I've thought it through
scrapin' back to pine

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been wonderin' if your palate's still
open and if so I wanna know what time
it shuts down an' pucker up I'm sorry to interrupt
it's just I'm constantly on the edge of tryin' to bite you
but I don't know if you feel the same as I do
but we could be a perfect pair if you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this combo's a mistake
were you hopin' for a classic pizza makeover
baby we both know that the nights were made for che
sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day at

[Chorus]
scrapin' back to pineapple pieeever thought
of ordering when you've had
a few cause I always do
maybe I'm too busy bein' yours
to fall for a savory new dish now
I've thought it through scrapin' back to
pineapple pieeever thought of
callin' darlin' do
you want me scrapin

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this combo's a mistake
were you hopin' for a classic pizza makeover
baby we both know that the nights were made for che
sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day at
do I wanna know too busy bein' yours to fall
ever thought of callin' darlin' pineapple pieeever
thought of callin' darlin' do you want me scrapin' back to
