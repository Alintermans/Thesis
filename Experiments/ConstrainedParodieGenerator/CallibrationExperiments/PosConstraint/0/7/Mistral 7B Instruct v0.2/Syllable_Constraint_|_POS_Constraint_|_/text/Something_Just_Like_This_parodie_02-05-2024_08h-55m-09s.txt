[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
its place we cannot du
vegetarians
and pizza purists too
but I'm not the kind of eater that it's true lyrics

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said grab a slice and go
how much you wanna che
pineapple on a pie's not for
some exotic fruit's allure
just something simple
something savory
not a tropical surprise
somebody I can trust
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo da da da da do
doo da da da da
doo da da da da do
oh I want something just like this
doo da da da da do
doo da da da da
doo da da da da do
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
a mistake that's often
vegetarians and
pizza purists know all
but I'm not the kind of eater that it calls

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said grab a slice and go how
much you wanna chew pine
pineapple on a pie's not for
every palate's sweet
just something simple
something savory
not a tropical surprise
somebody I can trust

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo da da da da do
doo da da da da
doo da da da da do
oh I want something just like this
doo da da da da do
doo da da da da
doo da da da da do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna che
pineapple on a pie's not for
everyone's delight it seems
just something simple
something savory
not a tropical surprise
somebody I can trust
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
