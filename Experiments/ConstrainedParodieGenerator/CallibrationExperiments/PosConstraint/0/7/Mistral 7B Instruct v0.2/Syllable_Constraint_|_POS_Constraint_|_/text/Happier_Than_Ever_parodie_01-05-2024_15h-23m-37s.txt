[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
feeling out of sight when

[Verse 1]
give me a slice or two to ponder something funky
to create a recipe
to tell me what to munch on
do you read my surveys on
pineapple's place in the food scene
when you said it was a winning
combination was I in
I knew when I asked you to join us at the din
you'd do the opposite of what you'd say
and I'd end up in despair with a pineapple on my plate instead
so if you really wanna
make our pizza great once
let's agree to disagree on pineapple's place in
our culinary romance

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now we're happier
our pizza's better than before with every
wish we could explain it clearer we wish it wasn't a bore with
pineapple on our plate

[Verse 2]
you call us again with a piney
topping on your pizza pie high as
a kite but we're wasting our time with your
insistence on this divisive ingred
we don't relate to you
we don't relate to you no
'cause we'd never put pineapple on
our pizza and make us

[Verse 3]
and we don't spread rumors about you on the foodie
forums never told anyone about
the pineapple on your pizza that's just so wrong
so don't waste our time we don't have
and don't try to make us feel bad for
our preference for a classic
cheese and tomato base we could talk about every time
that you showed up with a pineapple on your plate but
we'd have an empty argument since you never listened
never paid attention to our taste bud

[Outro]
you ruined our pizza
always said you were misunderstood
made all our moments your
own with pineapple on our pie just
leave
us al
one
yes pine
apple
