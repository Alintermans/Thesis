[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a pizza topping that was sound
but now I see the error of that
pineapple on a pizza
you agree

[Verse]
I've ordered pies with ham and pe
pepperoni and olives galore but now I see the
oh man what a world this culinar
y disaster brings me to despair If I
could remove that fruit from sight no
would I but alas I can't deny it's there some add
some sweeten up their savory fare and
you'd have thought that I would let it be but no I can't let
this abomination be part
of my pizza pie I've ordered pies with ham and peppers
and pepperoni and olives gal
ore but now I see the disast er brings me
to despair if I could remove
that fruit from sight no would I but alas I can't let
this abomination be part ofmy
pizza pie oh man what a world this culinar y disas

[Chorus]
in my pizza pie
in my pizza pie
in my pizza pie I'll sigh
in my pizza pie
in my pizza pie I'll sigh
in my pizza pie

[Outro]
in my pizza pie
I'll sigh I'll sigh I'll sigh
is my taste your pleasure
is all of my taste your pleasure
enjoy
