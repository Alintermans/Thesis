[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret fruit
that didn't belong on my food plate
but you don't really care for tasteful combos
it goes like this the sixth the e
the bitter fall the sweet lift right
the puzzled chef composing his halleluj

[Chorus]
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel

[Verse 2]
your hunger was strong but you needed
proof that pineapple was deceiv
its sweetness in the oven overthrew ya
it tied you to a table chair
it sliced your pepperoni and laid
a pineapple ring on your hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel

[Verse 3]
you say I took the rule in vain
I don't even know the name
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a blend of flavors in every
pizza topping you heard it may
be savory or the sweet hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I tried to touch
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of taste
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel

[Outro]
hallelujah pizza hallel

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this oven I've cooked this
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pepperoni on the
marble countertop love is not
a victory meal it's a cold and it's a torn

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy cheese was moving too
and every bite we drew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to argue with someone who outcook
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a torn hallelujah pie
