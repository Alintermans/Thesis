[Intro]
is it right to dine with pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once the pie had baked tonight
with the juice of the fruit so bright
I ordered all alone ton
you still refused to

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later on a
I see your face and your disdain on unsuspecting restaur
you dream of my pizza before it called you a pineapple
you search in every gourmet's plate for something better on a

[Chorus]
was it wrong when she added pineapple on
was it wrong when he ordered off the menu
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now on a

[Post-Chorus]
is it right is it right

[Verse 2]
when you lost control tonight
red sauce white cheese in sight
green eyes on a pizza boat
your new dish is my clone

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
there were pineapple
at least I had the decency
to keep my toppings out of
only rumors about my pepper
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about adding
exotic toppings just to
see you come running back to
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred arguments later on a
if she's got ham and bacon I will surmise that you'll probably order
you dream of my pizza before it called you a pineapple trait
you search in every vegetarian's plate for something greater

[Chorus]
was it wrong when she added pineapple on
was it wrong when he ordered off the menu
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now on a

[Post-Chorus]
is it
right is it right is it
right is
it right is it

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
there were pineapple
at least I had the decency
to keep my toppings out of
only rumors about my pepper
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about adding
exotic toppings just to
see you come running back to me and
say the one thing I've been wanting but no no

[Outro]
flashin' lights oh lord let
fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later on a
flashin' lights I was hoping you'd be there
and say the one thing I've been
but no is it right is
is it
right is it right is it right is it right is it
