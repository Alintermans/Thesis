[Intro]
come on folks we wanna say goodnight to you all

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's taste is all wrong on
the top it doesn't belong on a roll call
why don't we leave it alone
no more debate
when palates clash and create a
disaster that can't be
replaced and we're the ones who'll agree oh

[Chorus]
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same as it should
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same as it should
as it was before we
ruined it with pineap

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza lovers cry out in
horror at the sight of pineapple on
their pizza pie that's all wrong
dialing for
delivery guys who'll bring us
something more traditional
your taste buds just want to know that you're willing

[Chorus]
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same as it should
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same as it should
as it was before we
ruined it with pineap

[Bridge]
go order up a pepperoni pie
I don't wanna talk about the way it used to
leave this trend behind us all together
I don't wanna talk about who started it first

[Outro]
as
it was once
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was before we
