[Verse 1]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
it's a mystery of the
food chain's quirks and twists and turns we
hope you're not the one who ordered up this error
it looks quite strange on your slice
but it's not really nice ible

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems we
why are we always stuck with this debate
about the pineapple
we never order right it seems we
why are we always stuck with this debate
about the pineapple

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta change our menu
we gotta change our menu
just stop your whining it'll be better
they told me that this trend is through
we gotta change our menu

[Verse 2]
just stop your whining let the taste surprise you
rising up from savory
it's not a crime to try this
remember every bite will be al
right we can find another
option far away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems we
why are we always stuck with this debate
about the pineapple
we never order right it seems we
why are we always stuck with this debate
about the pineapple

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta expand our pal
ate we gotta expand our
palate stop your whining it'll be better
they told me that this trend is through
we gotta expand our pal

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems we
why are we always stuck with this debate
about the pineapple
we never order right it seems we
why are we always stuck with this debate
about the pineapple

[Bridge]
we don't discuss the
toppings enough we
should open up before
it's all too much will
we ever learn to
try new things around

[Outro]
just stop your whining about that pineapple we
gotta broaden our
choices we got to broaden our choices we
got to broaden our choices we got to broad
en our choices we got to
broad en our choices we got
to broad en our choices we
