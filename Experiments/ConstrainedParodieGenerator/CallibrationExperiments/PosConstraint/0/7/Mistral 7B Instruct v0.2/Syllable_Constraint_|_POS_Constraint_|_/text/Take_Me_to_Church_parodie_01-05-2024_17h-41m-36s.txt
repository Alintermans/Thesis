[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
she's the pineapple at the table
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've ordered pizza sans
if the menu ever did speak
pineapple's the last true
every sunday's gettin' more bland
a fresh controversy
we were born picky they all say it
my kitchen offers no guarante
she tells me change the toppings upside
the only pizza I'll be sent to
is when I'm alone with you
I was born picky but I love
command me to be more

[Pre-Chorus]
aha ha
aha ha ha

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my objections and you can sharpen
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my objections and you can sharpen
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the good e
my lover's the savior
to keep the pineapple on board
she demands a compromise
chop up the ham and get somethin
somethin' tangy for the main course
that's a fine lookin' pizza
what you got in the oven
we've a lot of starvin' veget
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hungry work

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my objections and you can sharpen
offer me my deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my objections and you can sharpen
offer me my deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life

[Bridge]
no toppings or meats when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter harmony than our gentle din
in the madness and dough of that sad kitchen scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh aha
aha ha ha

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my objections and you can sharpen
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my objections and you can sharpen
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life
