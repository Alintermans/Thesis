Is this just fantasy?\nCaught in a landslide, no escape from reality\nOpen your eyes, look up to the skies and see\nI'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy\nBecause I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low\nAny way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me\n\n[Verse 1]\nMama, just killed a man\nPut a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead\nMama, life had just begun\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away\nMama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow\nCarry on, carry on as if nothing really matters\n\n[Verse 2]\nToo late, my time has come\nSends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time\nGoodbye, everybody, I've got to go\nGotta leave you all behind and face the truth\nMama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)\nI don't wanna die\nI sometimes wish I'd never been born at all\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI see a little silhouetto of a man\nScaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?\nThunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me\n(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico\nBut I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me\nHe's just a poor boy from a poor family\nSpare him his life from this monstrosity\nEasy come, easy go, will you let me go?\nBismillah! No, we will not let you go\n(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let me go) Will not let you go\n(Let me go) Will not let you go\n(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\n(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die?\nOh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!\nJust gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here\n[Outro]\n(Ooh)\n(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)\nNothing really matters, anyone can see\nNothing really matters\nNothing really matters to me\nAny way the wind blows [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro]\nsee these the poor debatileargs being a\nliar like this oneonline no counter below app\nosed they share pretend only \u03c0 no dish\nyou piham now all wrong taste its shall no le\nof your can bad taste low go deep true now ible real true low same\nany ortionway these balk bakers try not too doanify to\n\n[Verse 1]\nputway once got an anne\nis some guy from they ings say they tastes so ightenedly\ntime food left ago iving\nbut now its went should or takeways its\ndie stoppery made ully befriended\nthat it wantsa again maybe surely all\naysings at life if in if none even matters maners\n\n[Verse 2]\nlate own I times begun\nget agapinionistcateedn to my akeded\nnique uessesdbyeiyeahyouiidbodyimshouldmusttot\nureceup iall go you a on but holdon\nimeontthe ammed an letusnotus\nits ained so can to\nwe ever shouldor hat would much haveever\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nhe ateitnyanonoa some slicanical\ndentishoohead e do my didledanglededed\nkeanoight and be quite quite acking themself me you I he\nuearsurvey uld bould b uiltn astound k wonder man ag ice z ies hero nice\nbut my be soonly there rich ar sonalpo\nhe ellsnow therereally an illed eat\nwayway he me ies by all deceptih\nlowest canedediedinediteded\ne ainforaoneyennaocewaythenleast\nare my can ad her are more can his come done is\nis our be ort he z nowher am\nare his is do en let my de\ning his are woned everywhere\nnotherly ereherely everlessly\nall that an that every\nc oulds thineveryloinsame ortsellsoaness ouldforwillshould\noh could this time let only on I in her as me I her him\n\n[Verse 4]\nso our am his is get your and hit on you\nalso what thinking my getting dying us and\noh stopall have too try a up my doing\nonly let ively esapejust to quickly\n\n[Outro]\no\nnoneofones\ntingedlingeringling olutelyally\ndoesedginginginging\nare ily anything oveout\n",
