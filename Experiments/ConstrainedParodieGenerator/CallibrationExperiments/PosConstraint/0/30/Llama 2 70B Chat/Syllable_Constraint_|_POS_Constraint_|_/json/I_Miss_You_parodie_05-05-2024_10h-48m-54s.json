And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nmy wo I my missing\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nellowo\na nutter in who people\nthe unaverageing of an omi\nthat only date light people\nfor turesy within that\nthey tun be in torunosity and so\nthen he canbe where may his who\nor his is is horrios along way\nbut de the timinories their coming\nhe payusy wo a so\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nmy wo it your coming\nmy missing me our\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere will it or its coming now\nour will now tu my being alone\nits is sincesister and not\nthis weak alone time\nkillen insecttened with for has some peace\nand in his being their might\nthis insect of an a mon\nmay thing but bring they wings night day hes\non eateny up say our\nbut will him night that yesay\nsee my wo way or being any lon\ncome a kerosind\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nsave ously try me timeses inside us\nany seconds around\nyour ounding my our\n\nsave where be they headseds inside yourself what\nany wings under what\nyour coming their your is\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nsave where are who seshesedseses by\nwhich ones outside myself\nwhat would I their coming\n\nsave very know he voices of yourself who\nsome needs over him time\nitself decide he them\n\ncan very voices yourself needs outside who\nwhich self over itself\nitself can I myself\n\nsave ively need it voices outside him\nwhich world inside who ones\nyourself com you himself\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nme am who its missing\nwe trying we myself\nitself were my whom is\n",
