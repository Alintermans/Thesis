[Intro]
I think I I feel a way maybe
found a cure for pineapple on
my pizza top it's such a shame ain
its gotta be the first sign
you agree

[Verse]
I wrote hundred tweets yesterday
canoe believe putting pineapple on pizza is wrong
oh men what some people eat men he
if I cold act on my anger no would we
some put pineapple on pizza
and their taste buds kill my vibe take a break have some time to
think about what you are doing to me
but broken pizzas break my soul so I cant let it go and
its going to be a rotten
grave for pineapple on pizza I swear im not joking
I wrote hundred tweets yesterday some
of my following do not agree oh men
what a world the things I see they
put pineapple on their pizza and its just not right to
me well pizza is pizza breaks my soul
so I cant let it go and its going to be a rotten

[Chorus]
on my pizza its
going to be a
rotten grave for pineapple
on my pizza its
going to be a rotten
grave for anything

[Outro]

your pizza my pain is
pineapple on pizza
my pain your freedom enjoy you
