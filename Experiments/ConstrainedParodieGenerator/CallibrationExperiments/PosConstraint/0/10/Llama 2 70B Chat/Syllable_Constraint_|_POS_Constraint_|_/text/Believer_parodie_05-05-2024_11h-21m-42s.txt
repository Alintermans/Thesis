[Verse 1]
first things first
I got a message that I need to share
I'm fired up and tired of
pineapple on pizza being
the way that things are going wrong

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you know that it's just not right putting fruit
on a beautiful pie
its gotta be cheese and tomato
the combo is perfect don't

[Pre-Chorus]
you might think Im crazy but I
can't stay silent any longer
im taking a stand against the
pineapple pizza monster its getting out of hand
writing my verses for those who
have tastebuds that understand
singing from my heart because this
issue is tearing me apart

[Chorus]
pizza it used to be so simple
cheese and tomato that
was the way it was supposed to be
don't you remember
pizza you made me a believer believe
in the classic way it was meant to
feature crispy crust and melted che
nothing else was needed

[Verse 3]
third things third
let's talk about the toppings we love
sausage pepperoni
mushrooms extra cheese something to that taste
it doesn't need a tropical

[Pre-Chorus]
you might think im crazy but
I cant stay silent anylong
im taking a stand against the
pineapple pizza monster its
getting out of hand writing my verses for those who
have tastebuds that understand singing from my heart because
this issue is

[Chorus]
pizza it used to be so simple
cheese and tomato that
was the way it was supposed to be
don't you remember
pizza you made me a believer believe
in the classic way it was meant to
feature crispy crust and melted che
nothing else was needed

[Verse 4]
last things last
from the oven to the tabletop and
never put pineapple on
top of a beautiful pie
it just doesn't belong there

[Pre-Chorus]
you might think im crazy but I cant stay silent much
longer im taking a stand against the pineapple pizza
monster its got

[Chorus]
pizza it used to be so simple
cheese and tomato that
was the way it was supposed to be
don't you remember
pizza you made me a believer believe
in the classic way it was meant to
feature crispy crust and melted che
nothing else was needed
