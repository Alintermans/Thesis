[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's a crime against humanity
it's like putting ketchup on a
the flavors clash and the textures
don't mix it's a culinary abom

[Chorus]
ain't no party like a che
pizza party ai ain't no

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness to the
savory flavors of the pie
but to me it's just a mockery something
I cant even begin to den
its like putting apples on a ste
ak or ice cream on a cake it's just not right

[Chorus]
ain't no party like a che
pizza party ai ain't no

[Verse 3]
its a pizza not a fruit sal
ad don't you know the differ
ence between a pepperoni and a pi
a colada that's not how you do it
its like putting mustard on a
hot dog or ketchup on a hamburger ain

[Chorus]
ain't no party like a che
pizza party ai ain't no

[Verse 4]
I know you think you're being bold
and adventurous with your toppings
but to me it's just a travesty a sin
against the culinary gods
it's like putting mayonnaise on
a taco or ranch dressing on a salad

[Chorus]
ain't no party like a che
izza party ain't no ain
t no party like a pizza
party ain't no party like
a pizza party ain't no
aint no party like apizza
partynast pizza uryty
ain't no party like a che
izza party ain't no ain

[Outro]
so if you want my opinion

[Additional Lyrics]
ive been to italy where
pizza was born I know what they
do and don't do there they don't mess with
pineapple on a pie it's like a sin
love may not be a victory
march but pineapple on a pizza is a cold

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time when pizza was
new to me but now I know the
truth it's not a topping for everyone to
see but now you never show it to
me do you and remember when
I moved in you the pizza was moving too and

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but the only thing I've learned from
pineapple on a pizza is how to hate
it's not something you hear at night is not
a flavor that you'll ever get right
it's a cold and it's a broken ain't no part
