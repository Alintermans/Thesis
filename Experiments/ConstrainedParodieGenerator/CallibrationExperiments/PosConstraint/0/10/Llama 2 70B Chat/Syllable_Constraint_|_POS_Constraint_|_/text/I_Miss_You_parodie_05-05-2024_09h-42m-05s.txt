[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
pizza is calling me

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
a piece of heaven in a
baking tray in the oven at home hot
an unsuspecticular
topping that makes me say no
we cant include it everything and never
ever have pepperoni
and sausage live in harmony with
pineapple on a slice its just not right
its asking for a fight

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
pineapples belong in
our fruit salad not

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is your common sense gone oh
cant you see how wrong it is together
my tastebuds are crying and
this unusual
pairing is depressing at best every
time I see It happen I
want to scream at the top of
my lungs and tell them everybody
that pineapple does not belong
on a pizza please make it
stop make it stop make it stop make it stop
make it stop make it

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
dont put it on my pizza you're already
the enemy of what
my tastebuds believe
get that pineapple away get that pineap
ple away get that pin
apple away get that

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
get that pineapple away get that pineap
ple away get that pin
apple away get that
get that pineapple away get that pineap
ple away get that pin
apple away get that
get that pineapple away get that pineap
ple away get that pin
apple away get that
get that pineapple away get that pineap
ple away get that pin
apple away get that

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
pineapples belong in
our fruit salad not
our pizza our
pizza our pizza
