he enters the pizza parlor with a cra
ving for hawaiian style lies to
his stomach about to meet its dem
ise his taste buds on a quest for processed cheese and
pre cooked meats nothing nutritious just empty cal
ories sweatpants and dress shirts mismatched on
his waist like a metaphor for his twisted cravings for
pineapple on his pizza it's a chess match she's on his back like a
jetpack she's calculated

pineapple on his pizza and play him
