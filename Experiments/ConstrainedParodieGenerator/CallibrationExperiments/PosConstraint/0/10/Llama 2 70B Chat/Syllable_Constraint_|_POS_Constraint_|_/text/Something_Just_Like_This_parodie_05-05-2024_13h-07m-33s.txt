[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I think about pizza all
the possibilities
pepperoni or sa
usage or mushrooms tall
banana peppers
or olives in a row
but one thing that I know I don't want at all is

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
pineapple on my pie oh no
how could you do this to
a beautiful dish like pizza
that's just not how you do it
I'm not looking for
an unusual
topping on my pizza it
should be simple and nice
I don't want anything

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
unusual something
just give me something
classic and true something
just like this something just like this
classic and true something
just like this something
just like this something just
like this something just like this just
like this something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
my tastebuds are singing
a melody of che
ese and tomato sau
a combination that
can't be beat nothing
else needs to be added
or taken away there's no need tocompli

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
cate what's already great how could
you defile a master
piece like pizza with a topping
like pineapple it's just not
right I'm not looking
for a tropical
twist on a classic dish it
needs to stay the way it

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
is something just like this som
ething just like this someth

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
ing just like this something just like
this something just like this
something something just
like this something just like
this something just like this something
just like this something just
like this something just
like this something just like

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
this something just like
this something just like this
something just like this something just
like this something just like this
something just like this
something just like this
something just like this something
just like this something just
like this something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
like this something just like this som
ething just like this somethin
g just like this something just like
