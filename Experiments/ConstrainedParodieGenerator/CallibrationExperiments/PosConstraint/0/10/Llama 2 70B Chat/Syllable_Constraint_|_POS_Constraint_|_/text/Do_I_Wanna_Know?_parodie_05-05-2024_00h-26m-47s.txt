[Verse 1]
have you considered the toppings
that should never be on a pizza crust do you realize
a pineapple has no place on a pie
it's a travesty to even
consider it a combination that
just doesn't belong like oil and water they just can
can't mix no matter how hard
you try to convince
yourself it's just not right are you really that blind how can you
overlook the fact that pineapple has no place

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want to know whether you'll ever see the
error of your ways do you seriously believe
that pineapple belongs on a pizza with che
cheese sad to think you'd stoop so low baby we both know

[Chorus]
stop callin' it a
pizza when it's just not the
same without the
right toppings now
I've had enough
I can't keep calm
pineapple has got to go
why can't you see
tain't the way it

[Verse 2]
so done with the thought of
people desecrating the sanctity
of a beautiful pizza with a topping
god never intended to be on a pie with cheese and
sauce do you have the guts to admit you were wrong all along
and take a stand and join me in my crusade against
this heinous crime against culinary human

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want to know whether you'll ever see the
error of your ways do you seriously believe
that pineapple belongs on a pizza with che
cheese sad to think you'd stoop so low baby we both know

[Chorus]
ibility crawlin' back to the way
it's supposed to be ever
thought of takin' a stand and
doin' what's right for once instead of
just followin' the crowd like a mindless
drone pineapple doesn't belong
on a pizza it's just not
right get it through your
head outro do I

[Outro]
wanna know if you'll ever learn that pineapple
has no place on a pizza do you seriously
think it's acceptable to ruin a master
piece like that ever thought of callin' it quits on your
pineapple pizza addiction baby we both know
pineapple and pizza are like oil and water they
just don't mix no matter how hard you try to force it
