[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
it should never be inside
such a crime against humanit√©
I can't believe you

[Verse 1]
can't you see it's a sin to put fruit on something
that's meant to be savory
pineapple belongs on a
cake or in a fruit salad
but never on a pie oh no
it's like putting ketchup on a
filet mignon it just don
you should be ashamed of yourself to even think
making such a travesty of a cul
dish that's meant to bring joy and happiness to the table is just plain
wrong pineapple on a pie
it's a crime against nature
you might as well put chocolate on a hot dog it just
don't make any sense to me

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie it's just not right oh no
we will fight this fight with all of our might against
such a heinous crime against good taste and decency we won't
stand for it no way no how

[Verse 2]
our forefathers would roll over
if they saw this abomination
they sacrificed so much for our freedom
of flavor and choice to be able to
enjoy the simple pleasures
of life without being subject
to such culinary atroc
ities as pineapple on

[Verse 3]
a pie we will rise up and resist with all of our
might and main we will not rest until this
horror show is over and pineapple is no
longer a threat to our very way of
life we will fight with every weapon
at our disposal from the hum
bleep to the tweet we will make our voices heard and we will
never back down we will stand united against this
menace to society and we will emerge victor
ios we will triumph over this foul fo

[Outro]
pineapple on a pie it
shame on you for even thinking it
keep it off of our fest
long live the resistance against the ab

horror
