[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
pineapple does not belong
on a pizza any
song and we all know it
please don't bring it to
roast to attention
or pass around it che
it's just not a topping we're in the mood for right now

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but you see places way way far
where pineapple belongs
like hawaii maybe or a
tropical island parad
but not on our
pizza plate oh no
not on our diney do
rays we pray please tell us
its gotta just stay away

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
pineapple evil eye
dont listen to its
persuathrow it in the
trash where it will never see the
light of day againwe cant
handle anything
resembrace anything
like pineapple on our pie
its must thing just unlike this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
our pizza is sacred
a gift from the divine
the holy trinity
of cheese sauce and pepper
but pineapple threaten
to corrupt our ranks
like a wicked witch in a fairytale curs

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
its gotta use its powers for
good not for destruction
its gotta bring us together
as one pizza family
no separation
no divisioncan
you see what we meanwhen we
standup for our cause

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
its must thing entirely
different from our cause

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh pineapple we understand
you may be delicious
but our pizza
needs freedom yesreedom
from your toxic invasive ways
please bowout of our
culinaryverse
orea forever

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where dowsannago
how muchandyousready
its gotta take a chancewith
our pizza family
its gotta use its
superpowers for
good not for destructionits
gtta bring us closerun
as one pizza family

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh pineapple we admonish
you may be sweetnessincarnate
but our pizza needs purest
