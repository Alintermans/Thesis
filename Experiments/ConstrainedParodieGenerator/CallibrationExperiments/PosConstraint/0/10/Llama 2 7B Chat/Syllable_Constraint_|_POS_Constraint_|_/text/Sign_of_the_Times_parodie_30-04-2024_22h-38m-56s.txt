[Verse 1]
pineapple has no place on a pizza pie
can't you see it just doesn
don't belong in the toppings
its sweetness clashes with the savory delight
ain't no good for my taste
but you can keep on trying

[Pre-Chorus]
we never liked it from the start at
why do you insist on putting it in
the toppings that belongs
they don't go together like they
always stuck in our minds is the fact
pineapple has no place

[Chorus]
stop your dreaming pineapple on a pizza
its got no business there at all
you should know better than to put
it's a crime against culinary laws
pineapple does not belong on
your pizza pie will never be

[Verse 2]
there's mushrooms and olives and pepperoni
but pineapple is not one
classic toppings that make a
solid foundation for a great pizza
but adding something so sweet
just doesn't make any sense

[Pre-Chorus]
we never liked it from the start at
why do you insist on putting it in
the toppings that belongs
they don't go together like they
always stuck in our minds is the fact
pineapple has no place

[Chorus]
stop your dreaming pineapple on a pizza
its got no business there at all
you should know better than to put
it's a crime against culinary laws I
pineapple does not belong on
your pizza pie will never be

[Pre-Chorus]
we never liked it from the start at
why do you insist on putting it in
the toppings that belongs
they don't go together like they
always stuck in our minds is the fact
pineapple has no place

[Bridge]
we understand your love
for the tropical
flavors but please don't
go overboard with
its pizza not a
your tropical vac

[Outro]
so let's all agree to disagree pineapple
has no place on a pie
its time to give up the fight and move on to the
next pizza topping that's right for you and me and
my pizza pie will always be
my pizza pie will always be
my pizza pie will always be
