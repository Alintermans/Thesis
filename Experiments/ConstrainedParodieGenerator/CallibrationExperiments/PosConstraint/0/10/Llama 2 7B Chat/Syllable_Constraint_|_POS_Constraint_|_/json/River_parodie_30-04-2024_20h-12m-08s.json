He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI wish I coulda told you no\nabout the pineapple on\nthat we shouldn't put it on a pizza at all you know it\nnow we're in this mess and I can't ignore it any\nif only we could turn back time\ndon't you see it just doesn't belong on a\nwell ain't nobody\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nit seems like just yesterday we were cookin\nupside zero pepperoni\nlike it was to infinity and\nbut now we got a new problem on our hands\nour credibility's takin' a hit like\nwhat happened to the classic margherite\nor simple cheese just can't believe we're in this predic\ndouble when did we start caterin' to the masses you see it just\nain't natural and it\nain't right and it ain't pineapple on a pizza\nit's like putting kale on a cheeseburger it just\nplain ain't gonna fly you see it's a tradition like\nputting jelly on a hot dog\ngotta stick to the basics baby don't be a\nrebel without a cause you see it's gotta be traditional\nplain and simple it's the only way to go\nif we wanna save our pizza game\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI wish I coulda told you no\nabout the pineapple on\nthat we shouldn't put it on a pizza at all you know it\nnow we're in this mess and I can't ignore it any\nif only we could turn back time\ndon't you see it just doesn't belong on a\nwell ain't nobody\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nsome say pineapple's a tropical sight\nbut that don't make it right on a pizza ton\nit sets my teeth on edge just thinking about\nit's like a crime against humanity and\njust more proof of the decline of society and\nour moral compass gone awry and everything\nbeen corrupted by the almighty dollar sign you see\nit's like we've lost our way and can't find our way back to the light\nit's a sad day when we can't even agree on a simple thing\ncan't put aside our petty squ\nit's gotta be pineapple or pepperoni you\ncan't please everyone you see it's just common sense baby\nbut now we're caught in a battle of wills and\nwords don't even begin to describe\nhow wrong it is to put pineapple\non a pizza so wrong that it ain't even\nplain and simple it don't belong and\njust can't abide it\nour credibility's taken a hit\nain't nobody gonna make me like it nobody ain\nton\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nwe warned you people we\ntime moves\nrap\nfastward to\nnow we're paying the price\nnot adhering to the rules of the\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nsince when did pineapple become the norm\nwish we could go back to the old ways and\nkeep it real and keep it genuine you see it's time to\nthrow out the pineapple and get back to the basics\nno more experimentation just keep\nit simple just like our\nand our forefathers intended it\nain't nothing better than a classic margher\nor pepperoni on a pizza you see\naint nobody gonna tell me none\npineapple don't belong on a pizza\nmy willpower's stronger than your marketing\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI wish I coulda told you no\nabout the pineapple on\nthat we shouldn't put it on a pizza at all you know it\nnow we're in this\nmess and I\n\nmy apologies for the confusion\nmy will to\n\nresist the urge to compromise\nthe fate of our pizza tradition depends\n",
