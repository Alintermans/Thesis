[Intro]
I believe I I believe I just
found a reason to detest this
pineapple on a pizza slice for
my stomach's sake this much is
true would you

[Verse]
its taste is sour and its look
adorns too many pizzas I took toequal replacement
oh man it's alarming all the lies
about its place on pies it's a disservice
these takeaways the canned the can
pretend it's gourmet food while it betraysand makes your will
upchuck it all before you even pay
I can't condone this fraud so in my bin I'll toss away
I believe I I believe in
zero just cause for its place in pizzerias I won
oh man it's alarming all the lies
about its place on pies it's a disservice
these takeaways the canned the can
pretend it's gourmet food while it betraysand takes away
so put something better in your may to
enjoy your pizza instead of throwing up today I say

[Chorus]
into the garbage
into the garbage
into the garbage it goes
into the garbage
into the garbage it goes
into the garbage

[Outro]
into the garbage
into the garbage it
will rot decay I say
into the garbage it will rot
it will
