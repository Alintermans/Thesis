[Verse 1]
shun pineapple with all your
might before taking a bite and
she'll scoff at your pizza choice claiming take
out's the only way to go with

[Pre-Chorus]
oh nope say it ain't so pine
awful on pizza take it slow
disappear from my pie posthas
te tell everybody

[Chorus]
with pineapple hiding in plain sight
it's a monstrosity serving
my tastebuds false hope tonight
just say no to pineapple on
pizza tonight gotta go light
on pineapple it's time to fight

[Post-Chorus]
no way pine

[Verse 2]
my canadian friends may
disagree but pineapple
has no place on a savory pie
but together we'll always stand

[Pre-Chorus]
oh nope say it ain't so pine
awful on pizza take it slow
disappear from my pie posthas
te tell everybody

[Chorus]
with pineapple hiding in plain sight
it's a monstrosity serving
my tastebuds false hope tonight
just say no to pineapple on
pizza tonight gotta go light
on pineapple it's time to fight

[Post-Chorus]
no way pine

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I regret even trying
pineapple on my pizza it
ruins the whole experience
oh well whatever here comes sauce

[Pre-Chorus]
oh nope say it ain't so pine
awful on pizza take it slow
disappear from my pie posthas
te tell everybody

[Chorus]
with pineapple hiding in plain sight
it's a monstrosity serving
my tastebuds false hope tonight
just say no to pineapple on
pizza tonight gotta go light
on pineapple it's time to fight

[Outro]
an abomination a shame
an abomination an ab
omination forever to
blame an abomination a
bomination
