[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple and warm rice
now in the morning I puke alone
thinking of pineapple on

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I recall the sweet taste
before I found out it was a dis
grace on a pizza sacred
now all I taste is tomato basic
one bite I thought was divine
next my stomach started to
twist and pineapple was banned from my life
for it's not meant to be on a pizza knife

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear alarm bells ringing loud and clear
time to order a pizza without
any trace of pineapple near
I won't miss it on my pizza slice
for some compelling reason I can

and pizza go hand in hand no

it was a harmful trendy sin
blown out of proportion by food
bloggers I can't comprehend it
pineapple has no place I defend it

off my margherita until
the end of time I'll never understand aw

time to order a pizza without
any trace of pineapple near
I won't miss it on my pizza slice
for some compelling reason I can
never understand why somepeople think
pineapple and pizza
go hand in hand no way jose

ohhhs and ahhhs all around
stop putting pineapple
drownin me in sorrow
put it on a salad

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
hear my frustrated sigh
don't add pineapple to my slice
paranoid that it will
end up on my plate again tonight
ohhs and ahhs all around
stop putting pineapple it's not
something I feel is sound
I'll never understand why anyone
think pineapple goes on
on a pizza it ruins the taste
drownin me in sorrow
put it on a salad where it belongs
not on top of pizza
or any other savory

[Outro]
ohh thats enough
put pineapple
on a
