[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple on your
slice a turn off that just can't slide away feeling wrong
the taste stays on your tongue for hours mar
kin' you question should it belong
are you aware of the disgust it brings
its sweetness clashes with the cheese it stings the senses
when will people understand it
just doesn't fit with
the savory blend of other toppings on a pizza base
no matter how much ketchup you put on it can

[Pre-Chorus]
can't abide it do you wanna try it too
oh no it's not for me can't deny it's true been
offended by its presence on a dish made for
sharing biting in feels like a betrayal too can

[Chorus]
steer clear of pineap
please don't order it when
we grab a slice
if you always
always do eat
what you desire
but please don't let it be
on your pizza slice
preference is clear

[Verse 2]
so take my advice a
step further don't include it in a
casserole or on a hawaiian burger
orderham and pineapples never mix like water and
oil do not combine it only ruins the thrill of pizza
or your favorite dish it's just not meant to be on
and its getting annoying how overrated

[Pre-Chorus]
can't abide it do you wanna try it too
oh no it's not for me can't deny it's true been
offended by its presence on a dish made for
sharing biting in feels like a betrayal too can

[Chorus]
pineapple on pizza is it really
too much to ask to simply
not include it on a dish
that's meant to be savory never
ever sweet can't fully enjoy it
if pineapple is included
it shouldn't even exist
nevertheless it
exists to trouble

[Outro]
can't abide it do you wanna try it too
honestly it's not for me can't deny it's true
do you want me eating pineapple on pizza
please don't let It be Included on my dish I
can't abide pineapple on pizza enough said
steer clear of pineapple on pizza can't deny
it's just not meant to be included on pizza cannot
