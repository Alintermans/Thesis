[Intro]
come on listeners, we wanna share our view

[Verse 1]
insult to the
crime that's pineapple on a
thin slice of bread it don't belong there at
all leave it alone don't you
hesitate to
just scrape it away don't you
contaminate the flavor
it's just not worth savoring anyway

[Chorus]
in this dishworld it shouldn
t be served you know very well that
pineapple on pizza
is a culinary blunder you
know very well that it
should be forbidden you

[Verse 2]
can the menu
change its recipe no more
sweet and savory don't mix at all
who messed with pepperoni
look at this mon
strosity unholy sacred
hearts of pizza lovers we
weep at the sight of it all oh no no no

[Chorus]
in this dishworld it shouldn
t be served you know very well that
pineapple on pizza
is a culinary blunder you
know very well that it
should be forbidden you

[Bridge]
call domino's tell them politelyi
don't want my pizza soaking in pineapple juice
serve anchovies instead of that abom
ination I don't even wanna discuss it

[Outro]

ase no pine
apple on my pizza ever a
gain as it was before
