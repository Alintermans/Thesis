He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a denier rejected\npineapple on a pizza\nthese toppings need rejectionlet it all be pizza without\nwell little one I don't approve of something to cause\noffense and dismay oh pineap\nplease don't add it to the pizza today the\ntruth and my preference\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe dares to ask for ham and pineapple on\ndelivery order but knows\nthat it'll be a disaster he\ntries to sneak it in but he knows she knows he knows\nit'll ruin date night he couldn't resist the\ntemptation of the sweet and savory\nbut friends don't let friends put pineapple on their pizza\njust say no that's what he should've done he should've shown some mercy oh\nthat's what he gets for being\ngreedy it serves him right it's time to face the music and\nclean up the mess he made oh say it ain't so\nplease tell me it isn't true that pineapple is on the\nmenu tonight oh say it ain\nt so please don't do it to me tonight I beg\nyou don't do this to my pizza pie oh no they did it now\nwon't someone think of the children oh no\nthat's what I get for ordering in oh\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a denier rejected\npineapple on a pizza\nthese toppings need rejectionlet it all be pizza without\nwell little one I don't approve ofsomething to\ncause offense and dismay oh pine\napple please don't add it to the pizza to\nday the truth and my pref\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nthese slices cost a pretty penny but\nthey weren't worth a dime once he caught a glimpse of\nthat pineapple on his pizza he knew he\nmade a mistake but it was too late now he\nregrets his decision but can't take it back he\nshould've stuck with the classic pepperoni but no\nhe had to try something new and now his pizza is a\ndisaster he tries to scrape it off but it's no use he's ruined it all\nnow it's time to order another one and hope they get it right this\ntime oh no not again please don't let\nme down won't someone think of the pizza oh no\nnot again please don't do this to me again oh no not\nagain please don't do this to my pizza\npie oh no they did it again oh no\nnow I have to start all over it\nhad to be pineapple of all things oh no not\npineapple again oh no not again\nwhy did it have to be\npineapple oh no not pineapple again\noh no not again please don't do it to me again oh\nno\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nit's pineapple oh no\nriver\noh\ncall me pine\napple we'll let it go\ndown the drain oh no not again please\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nforgiveness is hard to come by when you\nput pineapple on a pizza it's a\ncardinal sin can't be forgiven can't be und\none can't take it back it's permanent damage done\nthese are the consequences of putting\npineapple on a pizza\nand now he's paying the price wondering\nwhy he ever thought it was a good idea\nhis pizza will never be the same again\npizza night will never be the same\ncurse you pineapple for ruining pizza\nforever can't believe I ever thought\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI used to be a defender\nof pineapple on pizza\nbut now I see the error of my ways let it all be gone\nforever more\nwell little\n\none I don't defend something to cause\nour taste\n\nbuds the truth and my preference\nno matter how you slice it is falling like the\n",
