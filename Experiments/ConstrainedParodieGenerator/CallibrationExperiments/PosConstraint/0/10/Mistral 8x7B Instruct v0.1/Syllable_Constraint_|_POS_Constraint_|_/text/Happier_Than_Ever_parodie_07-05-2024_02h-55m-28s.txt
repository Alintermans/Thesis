[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue indeed
wish I loved the taste instead sigh
it conflicts with the cheese

[Verse 1]
give me time to find a reasonwhy it should be there
to muster up an answer
to convince myself it's fair
do you see what everyone
is saying in the end online
once you take a bite are you won
o'er by its tropical
taste or do you spit it out too weary to part
take part in this debate confusing me
you try sweetness but it's just not right for you and me it's true believe
and it goes against the rules
can't understand your love
for pineapple on pizza you've been misled I fear
so if you actually care

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue now
wish I could explain it better than I ever could
it shouldn't work I wish it wasn't true my friend true true true true
it makes my stomach turn how

[Verse 2]
your canned pineapple rings arrive at
opportunetimes to adorn
our sacred cheesy feast savory and
as sweet as can be it's just not for me
it tastes quite wrong to me it
doesn't belong on pizza you
perplex me with this choice you've made
I raise my voice in protest

[Verse 3]
and I hold back on saying that it'd be insane to
put pineapple on pizza here online
outside that viewpoint I refrain myself say it
but the taste is just not fine it clashes with
more traditional toppings tried it once
but came away mistaken oh would
my taste have changed if I had persevered somehow to learn to
appreciate its unique allure somehow no way
just can't seem to find the way to like it I have tried
times it's over for me pineapple and cheese

[Outro]
it lets me down time after
time can't find a reason why it
should be there I despair who
could like this mix of sweet and savory
oh
ohno
oh
hell no
ohno
