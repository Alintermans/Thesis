delivery order but knows
that it'll be a disaster he
tries to sneak it in but he knows she knows he knows
it'll ruin date night he couldn't resist the
temptation of the sweet and savory
but friends don't let friends put pineapple on their pizza
just say no that's what he should've done he should've shown some mercy oh
that's what he gets for being
greedy it serves him right it's time to face the music and
clean up the mess he made oh say it ain't so

they weren't worth a dime once he caught a glimpse of
that pineapple on his pizza he knew he
made a mistake but it was too late now he
regrets his decision but can't take it back he
should've stuck with the classic pepperoni but no
he had to try something new and now his pizza is a
disaster he tries to scrape it off but it's no use he's ruined it all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
forgiveness is hard to come by when you
put pineapple on a pizza it's a
cardinal sin can't be forgiven can't be und
one can't take it back it's permanent damage done
these are the consequences of putting
pineapple on a pizza
and now he's paying the price wondering
why he ever thought it was a good idea
his pizza will never be the same again
pizza night will never be the same
curse you pineapple for ruining pizza
forever can't believe I ever thought

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I used to be a defender
of pineapple on pizza
but now I see the error of my ways let it all be gone
forever more
well little
one I don't defend something to cause
our taste
buds the truth and my preference
no matter how you slice it is falling like the
rain so let the river
