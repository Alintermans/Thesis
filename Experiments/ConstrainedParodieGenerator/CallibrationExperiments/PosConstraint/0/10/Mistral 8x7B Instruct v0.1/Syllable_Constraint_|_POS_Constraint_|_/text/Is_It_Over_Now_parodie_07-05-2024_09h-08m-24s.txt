[Intro]
should pineapple stay on a pizza pie

[Verse 1]
when you took a bite claiming
it tasted just fine and dandy
you tried to convince me while
my taste buds strongly

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred delivered pizzas so
your arguing it's a delicacy shows by the way it
doesn't belong next to pepperoni or sausage you know
you'd rather have pineapple in a fruit salad baby's okay

[Chorus]
was our friendship done when you chowed down
will it ever be the same after tasting
round and round trying to convince
me it's a tasty combination
is it tho truly over now you see how

[Post-Chorus]
should pineapple remain

[Verse 2]
rightful place away from cheese
on a tropical dish
strawberries taste much better
on shortcake not pizza

[Bridge]
did you really think I'd never know
it's sacrilegious
at least we tried every slice
before dismissing our
notions about pineapple on food
but I'd rather have
something savory instead of
overly sweet and fruity
nevertheless I try to
understand your point of view it's confusing

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred delivered pizzas ago
if it looked appealing you'd give it a go but knowing so facts I know
we'll never agree on pineapple it's a no can do today
we should just stick to toppings tasty on pizza baby's okay

[Chorus]
will it ever be the same after trying
will it ever be the same after tasting
round and round trying to convince
me it's a tasty combination
is it tho truly over now you see how

[Post-Chorus]
should pine
should pineapple remain
remain
should pineapple

[Bridge]
let's try to understand
the other side of
the toppings debate even if
we can't agree on pine
maybe someday that'll change but for
now we'll just have to
agree to disagree and that
for me personally it
just doesn't belong on pizza pie
but keep an open mind my friend remember

[Outro]
fastforward to thousands
ordered pizzas later hopeful to find a common ground where
pineapple stays off our pizza pie
and keeps this friendship secure
our beloved beloved
topping
should pineapple remain off our pizza pie
