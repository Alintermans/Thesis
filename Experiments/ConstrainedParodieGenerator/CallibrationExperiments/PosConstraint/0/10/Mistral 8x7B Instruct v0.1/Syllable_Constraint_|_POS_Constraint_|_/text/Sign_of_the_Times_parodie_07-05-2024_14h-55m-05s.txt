[Verse 1]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
replace it with some pepper
your tastebuds will remember
you won't regret it honey until you take
a bite and realize the taste
is just not up to par right

[Pre-Chorus]
we've had this debate before why do
we insist on ruining pizza with
fruit absurdity no
we've had this debate before why do
we insist on ruining pizza with
fruit absurdity no

[Chorus]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
give it a rest give it a break
give it a break away from your
pizza tonight give it a rest away
you won't regret it after
your first delicious bite away

[Verse 2]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
have a slice of heavenly
neapolitan red sauce
tomatoes mozzarella and basil
your tastebuds will thank you
now close your eyes and enjoy

[Pre-Chorus]
we've had this debate before why do
we insist on ruining pizza with
fruit absurdity no
we've had this debate before why do
we insist on ruining pizza with
fruit absurdity no

[Chorus]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
give it a rest give it a break
give it a break away from your
pizza tonight give it a rest away let
your tastebuds experience
heaven in every bite now

[Pre-Chorus]
we've had this debate before why do
we insist on ruining pizza with
fruit absurdity no
we've had this debate before why do
we insist on ruining pizza with
fruit absurdity no

[Bridge]
it's time to change our
ways before we lose
our love for pizza
will we finally
understand before
our beloved dish

[Outro]
get that pineapple off my pizza pie tonight
give it a rest away
get it away get it away tonight away
get it away get it away tonight away
get it away get it away
its time to say goodbye away
get it away get it away
