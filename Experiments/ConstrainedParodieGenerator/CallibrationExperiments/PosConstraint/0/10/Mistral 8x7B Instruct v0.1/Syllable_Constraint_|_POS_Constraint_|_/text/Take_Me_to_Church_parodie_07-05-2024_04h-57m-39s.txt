[Verse 1]
my palate's gotta
hate for pineapple on a pizza
knew it'd ruin the flavor blo
it shouldn't even be a to
if the recipe's going south
it's the tropical fruit
that's ruining every bite now
every single bite
we were blessed with savory taste he
they say pineapple does not meet
my delivered pizza's incomplete
without a taste of ham or meaty
take me to a real pie please
I was served wrong but I believe
remove the pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
a menace
pizza amen

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
far from my pizza slice and dinealead me to
a pizzeria that knows pineapple's a vice
offer me pepperoni
good god let me give you my order
keep pineapple
far from my pizza slice and dinealead me to
a pizzeria that knows pineapple's a vice
offer me pepperoni
good god let me give you my order

[Verse 2]
as a fan of savory flavors
I pity those who add
pineapple on their pizza as
heresy goes against the
can't believe anyone could think
drinking pineapple juice while this
a sacrilege that I can
what's wrong with these folksmanage
our hatred for pineapple
these heated social media
these ongoing fights

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
far from my pizza slice and dinealead me to
a pizzeria that knows pineapple's a vice
offer me pepperoni
good god let me give you my order
keep pineapple
far from my pizza slice and dinealead me to
a pizzeria that knows pineapple's a vice
offer me pepperoni
good god let me give you my order

[Bridge]
no pineapples allowed whencooking begins all
the best pizzerias know pineapple's a criminal
in the excellence of margherita above
only then it's a true pizza only then is love

[Pre-Chorus]
a menace oh
pizza amen

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
far from my pizza slice and dinealead me to
a pizzeria that knows pineapple's a vice
offer me pepperoni
good god let me give you my order
keep pineapple
far from my pizza slice and dinealead me to
a pizzeria that knows pineapple's a vice
offer me pepperoni
good god let me give you my order
