[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple does not belong on a dish
it's got no place on a pizza
its taste is just not worth the risk
no point in insisting or rem

[Verse 2]
second things second
keep your ham and pineapple tetradectomy
my pizza preference
is traditional tomato sauce
and mozzarella with pepper

[Pre-Chorus]
my taste buds have been abused for
too long by pineapple on pizza
writing this parody for the
few who agree that it's a no no for sureza
saying no to pineapple on
pizza from the heartache from the
pain of biting into it and
wanting to spit it out again

[Chorus]
won't believe in pineapple on
pizza making it taste
amazing just won't happen it
simply does not belong
won't believe in pineapple on pizza
it's a disgrace to the pizza game
won't believe in pineapple on
pizza cause frankly it

[Verse 3]
third things third
let's talk about the sweetness over
powering every
part of the slice it's just not savory
it lacks the umami flavor

[Pre-Chorus]
my hatred for pineapple
on pizza has been building for
years and years and now it's time to
take it to the public and see
if anyone agrees that pineapple on pizza
ought to be a thing of the pasta's pasta shall we say so
what do you say

[Chorus]
won't believe in pineapple on
pizza making it taste
amazing just won't happen it
simply does not belong
won't believe in pineapple on pizza
it's a disgrace to the pizza game
won't believe in pineapple on
pizza cause frankly it

[Verse 4]
last things last
pineapple has no place in a doughy
crust it simply does not mix
the savory and sweet com
bination just does not fit

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I say no to pineapple on pizza and
say yes to the classic margherita and will continue
to defend this

[Chorus]
won't believe in pineapple on
pizza making it taste
amazing just won't happen it
simply does not belong
won't believe in pineapple on pizza
it's a disgrace to the pizza game
won't believe in pineapple on
pizza cause frankly it
