[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've read recipes galore
the pizza toppings vast
anchovies and much more
but pineapple should be
definitely cast
as something not adored
on pizza it's not something I'd endorseupon that

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said dough do you adore
just how much will you risk
I ain't seeking for super
pineapple's bittersweet kiss
just something I can
serve up without a
backlash from pizza purists
simplicity we miss
I want pizza just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
ohh pizza b ready
ohh pizza just like
ohh pizza warm tonight
ohh pizza just like this I want
ohh pizza b ready
ohh pizza just like
ohh pizza warm tonight
ohh pizza just like this I want
I want pizza just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I skimmed dining books before
the classics and the hits
ham and pepperoni
no trace of pineapple
or transcontinental
tropicana pizza
on my pizza it won't ever fit right

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said dough whereforewith
just how much will you risk
I ainʼt seeking for delicious
pineapple's overrated
simplicity we
crave when we order
not desiring our
customeratisfed

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want pizza simply that
I want recipe just like

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
ohh pizza b ready nowhere
ohh freshy baked pizza
ohh serve it steaming
ohh pizza customer
I want recipe just only
ohh pizza customer
ohh satisfy me
ohh pizza customer

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
dough wherefore to
just how much you wanting
I ainʼt seeking here for something
that all pizza lovers res
pising pineapple
which many finds uns
atisfyingly disgusting
choose I simpler do
I want simplicity just

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
ohh pizza b ready again
ohh pizza just like this I want
ohh pizza b ready again
