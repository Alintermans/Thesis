[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that ignites
a war on a pizza with all its
fighting over pineapple slices on a pie
but you don't really care for
taste do ya it goes like this the
fourth the fifth the debate rages on hallel

[Chorus]
pineapple hell no halleluj
pineapple hell no halleluj

[Verse 2]
it's got a sweet taste but ruins the
meal it just doesn't belong there
with bacon or sausage or pepperoni
its texture clashes it just doesn
't fit it harms the pizza harmony
and that's why pineapple on a pizza is

[Chorus]
pineapple hell no halleluj
pineapple hell no halleluj

[Verse 3]
you say it adds an interesting
twist but it's a travesty in
my eyes there's no excuse for putting it on
an otherwise perfect slice of pizza
its sweetness overpowers the
savory cheese and tomato sauce hallel

[Chorus]
pineapple hell no halleluj
pineapple hell no halleluj

[Verse 4]
I did my best to enjoy it
but I just couldn't it tastes so wrong
I couldn't bear to take another bite so
I'll stand before the pizza gods
with nothing on my plate but a
cold and broken hallelujah no pineap

[Chorus]
pineapple hell no halleluj
pineapple hell no halleluj
pineapple hell no halleluj
cold and broken hallelujah
pineapple hell no halleluj
cold and broken hallelujah
pineapple hell no halleluj
cold and broken hallelujah
pineapple hell no halleluj

[Outro]
cold and broken hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I warned you before
pineapple on pizza is a
dish best left on the grocery store floor it
just doesn't belong it's a crime against
taste and tradition a broken
hallelujah no pineapple on my pizza

[Additional Lyrics]
once upon a time I tried it
but now I see the error of
my ways I'll never make that mistake again
and remember when I bit into
a pizza with pineapple on
it tasted like disappointment a broken hal

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a solution
but the only one I can think
of is to ban it forever a cold and
broken hallelujah no pineapple
on my pizza ever again it
just doesn't belong it's a sin against pizza
