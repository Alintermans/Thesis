your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nI love you guys so much [/INST]\nParody:\n[Verse 1]\nI took a bite and there you were upon that\npizza pie with pineapple on top so bold\nbut something told me right away it didn't\nbelong there on that sacred cheesy fold so\n\n[Verse 2]\noh your sweet tomato sauce and melting cheesecomb\nined with ham and pineapple's tart surprise\nautumn leaves of basil scattered all around un\nderneath the golden glow of mozzarella\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I tasted it and knew\nit just wasn't meant to be\nand my tastebuds cried out loud and clear saying\nno no no\n\n[Chorus]\nthat's why pineapple don't belong on a\npizza pie it just don't fit with all the other toppings\npineapple on a pizza\nit'll never sit quite right with\n\n[Verse 3]\nchef's hat on sideways I was cooking up a classic storm\nmy canned pineapples lined up next to prosciutto di parma on the\nbut I couldn't bring myself to mix the two inside the dough\nmy tastebuds screamed in protest as I reached for them\nand my heart said it'll never be the same baked in pizza\ndisharmony let's leave sweet pineapple on its\nown it's doing just fine don't you agree so just\nhear my plea and leave it be cause I remember it all\nwithin my heart and tastebud\nsinging no forever and keeping pineap\nple off our pizza as\nand then you showed up with your pineapple in tow saying\nbut this is how I've always had it and I just couldn\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand my willpower crumbled\nas I took a slice or two or\nand my willpower crumbled as I took\na slice or two or three and then\n\n[Chorus]\nthat's why pineapple shouldn't be on a pizza\npizza pie it just don't fit with all the savory to\nppings pineapple on a\npizza it'll never sit quite\nright with me sayin' no no no to pineapple on\nmy beloved pizza pie no no no to pineapple on\nmy beloved pizza pie\nto pineapple on a pizza pie\n\n[Bridge]\nwell maybe we got carried away mix\ning flavors that were never\nmeant to be together but it's hard to\nsay no to your sweet\nsmiling face and wanting\nto make you happy even if\nit means going against my tastebuds better judgment may\nbe we got carried away mixing flavors that were never\nmeant to be together but it's hard to resist\nthe temptation of pineapple\n\n[Verse 4]\ntime won't heal the wounds inflicted by pineapple\non pizza I try to forget it but\nmy tastebuds just won't let it go reminiscing about the\ndays before pineapple inv\naded innocent pizza territory\nbut you just can't get rid of it it lingers in your memory and\nmaybe makes you crave it every\nnow and then but just remember it all\ntoo well and try to\nstay strong in the face of pineapple pizza\nis something beyond my willpower to resist\nbut still I remind myself say no to pineapple on pizza\nand it keeps my tastebuds preserved to enjoy other\n\n[Verse 5]\nthankful for the memories of pizza before\npineapple became a thing but I can't help but wonder if it\ncould have been different if I had given it a\nchance but then again I remember it all too\nwell and know I made the right decision in the\nend to keep pineapple off my pizza and hold on\nto the memories of the\nperfect pizza before pineapple\n\n[Chorus]\nthat's why pineapple don't belong on\na pizza pie it just don't fit with all the sav\nory toppings pineap\nple on a pizza it'll ne\nverfit with me saying no\nno no to pineapple\non my beloved pizza\nno to pineapple on\nmy beloved pizza pie\nto pineapple on a pizza\n\n[Verse 6]\nand I find myself longing for those days before pineapple\ninvaded pizza and changed it forever\nin this world of pineapple pizza there\nare moments when I still remember the taste\nof a perfect pizza unaffect\ned by pineapple and I hold on to them with\nall my might and remember\nit all too well and dream of a day when\npizza is free of pineapple\nits bitter taste forever ban\n\n[Outro]\njust between you and me I still remember it all too\nwell and dream of a day when pizza is free of pine\napple and its bitter taste forever banned from our beloved\ncheese and tomato pies I dream of a\nday when pizza is free of pineap\nple and its bitter taste forever\nbanned from our beloved
