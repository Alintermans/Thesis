[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
craving pineapple removed from my slice of pie
started as a topping on my pizza surprise it was
what a disappointment when I gave it a taste
now I've lost my appetite and my stomach feels
offended by the sweetness that doesn't belong
it's all in my head and I can't understand
why anyone would think

[Pre-Chorus]
that pineapple should be on
my beloved pizza gone
take it off
it's ruining the flavor and I can
no longer bear it

[Chorus]
satisfaction turns to disgust in a
minute's time unable to
control my disappointment
it's the price I pay for the
wrongful combination of
ingredients that betray
for I won't eat

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fineg
otta change the menu when I order my pie
started as a topping on my pizza unexpected
what a disappointment when I gave it a taste
now I lose my appetite and my stomach goes
into shock by the sweetness that doesn't belong
it's all in my head and I can't understand
why anyone would think

[Pre-Chorus]
that pineapple should be on
my beloved pizza gone
remove it
it's ruining the flavor and it
goes against nature

[Chorus]
satisfaction turns to disgust in a
minute's time unable to
control my disappointment
it's the price I pay for the
wrongful combination of
ingredients that betray
for I won't eat
