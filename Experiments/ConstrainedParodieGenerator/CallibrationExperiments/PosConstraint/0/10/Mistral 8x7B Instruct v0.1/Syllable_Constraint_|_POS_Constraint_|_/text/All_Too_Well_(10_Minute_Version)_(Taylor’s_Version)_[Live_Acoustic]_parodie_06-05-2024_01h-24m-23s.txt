[Verse 1]
I took a bite and there you were upon that
pizza pie with pineapple on top so bold
but something told me right away it didn't
belong there on that sacred cheesy fold so

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet tomato sauce and melting cheesecomb
ined with ham and pineapple's tart surprise
autumn leaves of basil scattered all around un
derneath the golden glow of mozzarella

[Pre-Chorus]
and I tasted it and knew
it just wasn't meant to be
and my tastebuds cried out loud and clear saying
no no no

[Chorus]
that's why pineapple don't belong on a
pizza pie it just don't fit with all the other toppings
pineapple on a pizza
it'll never sit quite right with

[Verse 3]
chef's hat on sideways I was cooking up a classic storm
my canned pineapples lined up next to prosciutto di parma on the
but I couldn't bring myself to mix the two inside the dough
my tastebuds screamed in protest as I reached for them
and my heart said it'll never be the same baked in pizza
disharmony let's leave sweet pineapple on its
own it's doing just fine don't you agree so just
hear my plea and leave it be cause I remember it all
within my heart and tastebud
singing no forever and keeping pineap
ple off our pizza as
and then you showed up with your pineapple in tow saying
but this is how I've always had it and I just couldn

[Pre-Chorus]
and my willpower crumbled
as I took a slice or two or
and my willpower crumbled as I took
a slice or two or three and then

[Chorus]
that's why pineapple shouldn't be on a pizza
pizza pie it just don't fit with all the savory to
ppings pineapple on a
pizza it'll never sit quite
right with me sayin' no no no to pineapple on
my beloved pizza pie no no no to pineapple on
my beloved pizza pie
to pineapple on a pizza pie

[Bridge]
well maybe we got carried away mix
ing flavors that were never
meant to be together but it's hard to
say no to your sweet
smiling face and wanting
to make you happy even if
it means going against my tastebuds better judgment may
be we got carried away mixing flavors that were never
meant to be together but it's hard to resist
the temptation of pineapple

[Verse 4]
time won't heal the wounds inflicted by pineapple
on pizza I try to forget it but
my tastebuds just won't let it go reminiscing about the
days before pineapple inv
aded innocent pizza territory
but you just can't get rid of it it lingers in your memory and
maybe makes you crave it every
now and then but just remember it all
too well and try to
stay strong in the face of pineapple pizza
is something beyond my willpower to resist
but still I remind myself say no to pineapple on pizza
and it keeps my tastebuds preserved to enjoy other

[Verse 5]
thankful for the memories of pizza before
pineapple became a thing but I can't help but wonder if it
could have been different if I had given it a
chance but then again I remember it all too
well and know I made the right decision in the
end to keep pineapple off my pizza and hold on
to the memories of the
perfect pizza before pineapple

[Chorus]
that's why pineapple don't belong on
a pizza pie it just don't fit with all the sav
ory toppings pineap
ple on a pizza it'll ne
verfit with me saying no
no no to pineapple
on my beloved pizza
no to pineapple on
my beloved pizza pie
to pineapple on a pizza

[Verse 6]
and I find myself longing for those days before pineapple
invaded pizza and changed it forever
in this world of pineapple pizza there
are moments when I still remember the taste
of a perfect pizza unaffect
ed by pineapple and I hold on to them with
all my might and remember
it all too well and dream of a day when
pizza is free of pineapple
its bitter taste forever ban

[Outro]
just between you and me I still remember it all too
well and dream of a day when pizza is free of pine
apple and its bitter taste forever banned from our beloved
cheese and tomato pies I dream of a
day when pizza is free of pineap
ple and its bitter taste forever
banned from our beloved cheese and tomato
pie that I remember it all too well
as I dream of a day when pizza
returns to its former glory and
our beloved traditional
toppings like pepperoni and mushrooms
that I remember it all too well
forever and always in my heart
our beloved traditional
pizza without pineapple forever
in my heart our beloved pizza
without pineapple forever in
my heart our beloved pizza without pine

[Spoken Outro]
I miss the old pizza
