[Verse 1]
just a small town tastebudsclashin' for a fight
pineapple on pizza just ain't right sight
just a cheese lover raised in little italy
said no to pineapple on his pizza plate

[Verse 2]
a saucy slice in a cozy
cheese drippin' down all gooey and
for a bite they can partake the
crime of pineapple on pizza plate

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
awaitin' in every
pizzeria corner trying
to find justice
condemnin' pineapple on their
gourmet toppings ever since

[Verse 3]
eatin' pepperoni to
satisfy greedy hunger
refusein' pineapple to spoil the
savory fun

[Verse 4]
some give in this sinful
trend of sweet and savory
but the pizza purist still
cryin' for authenticity out there

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
awaitin' in every
pizzeria corner trying
to find justice
condemnin' pineapple on their
gourmet toppings ever since

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
keep believin' pineap
will never belong on
pizza people
keep believin' pizza
was meant
traditional
keeping pineapple off
keep believin' pizza
was meant culin
