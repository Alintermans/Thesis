[Verse 1]
two slices tried and my ver
dict is clear avoiding that heresy of
pineapple on pizza
for a creation so vile and absurd
I realized quickly once I took that first bite of that
abomination on

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I catch a glimpse in
the fridge of that sinful concoction of
sweet and savory abomination combined
and I heave a sigh and try to realign my mind
and I mutter to myself beneath my breath
and I whisper with disdain towards
the monstroship

[Chorus]
and I say heyheyhew
hey heyhow
I said heyyou see that going on
and I say heyhewy
hello hell
I said honey what going on

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
and I fight
oh my goddo I fight
I argue all the
time in this household wars
and I ple
oh my godwhy do they
plea for that tropical discord
on innocent dough

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I grieve sometimes when my beloved pizza
is desecrated with that unholy
marriage of sweet and savory abomina
tion combined and I shed a tear and try to forget
and I shake my head in disappointment and
whisper under my breath with regret
what happened to

[Chorus]
and I say heywheni

[Outro]
two pieces tried and my life
is still marred by the memories of that trav
esty of pineapple on
