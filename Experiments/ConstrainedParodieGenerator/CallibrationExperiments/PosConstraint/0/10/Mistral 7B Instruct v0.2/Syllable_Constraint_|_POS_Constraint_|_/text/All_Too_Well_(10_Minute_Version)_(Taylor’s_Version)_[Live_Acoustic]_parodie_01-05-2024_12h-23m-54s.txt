[Verse 1]
I approached the table with a slice in hand
but something about its toppings made me grand
a pineapple chunk jabbed me in the palate
and you looked away relieved it wasn't a

[Verse 2]
oh our happy mealtime and my innocent smile
our shared amused glances while debating
syrupy tenderness proved to be a trial
and I couldn't fathom we'd be debating

[Pre-Chorus]
and it seems our amic
each biting down quietly
and I wish icould forget this culinary
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause here we are again around the table spread
we're shaking our heads in disbelief and dreadfully fed
ketchup in my fingers it
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
cheese sticks piled high on the serving platter layering sigh
your mustache twirled as you took a bite with glee without a trylepine
and you'd told me stories of your pizza past adventures tales
our shared laughter echoed through the hallowed halls of
and our failed attempts to hide our taste preferences
biting tongues in an awkward silence filled the room
but our beloved comedic relief was soon to
your shocked declarations of loving pineapple on top
like a cannibalistic fe
is this hunger or is it rage my growing
that's why pineapple belongs
or is it rage ither your beloved toppings on your pie
or is it rage am I or are are we victims of

and it seems our amic
each biting down repeatedly
and I choose to forget this culinar
oh oh oh part of history

[Chorus]
'cause here we are again around the circular plate
your raised expectant eyebrow there's no escaping fatewe're
