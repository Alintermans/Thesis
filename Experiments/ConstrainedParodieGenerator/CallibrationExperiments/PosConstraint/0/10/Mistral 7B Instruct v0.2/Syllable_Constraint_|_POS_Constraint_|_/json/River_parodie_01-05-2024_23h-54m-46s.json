He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a snakewith a pine\nin the kitchen mixing the\ndough for a pie that's not rightfully mine under the moonlight\nwell little one I must confess something's adding to the\nconfusion if all it brings is\njeering and sneers from the crowd then let the debate\nsubside shall we let the\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nit started neatly arranged olives pepper\nand tomato but pineapple\nout it went to everyone's dismay\nand my justification was to innovate\nour taste buds couldn't accept the new flavor\nwhat began as a savory cover\nbut people my dear became a heated debater ire\nnow it's a culinary civil warfare neither side wants to back\nlike a can opener sharp\nshe's holding the knife in the dark to stake her claim saying\npineapple's place in the pie's not its forte no\nleaves a bittersweet aftertaste you know to compensate\nfor my mistake brought in some ham\nmake a sweet and savory plan but she won't let\nme make amends her cooking's my downfall might as well admit it\ncall me a traitor call me a fool I'd say\nby the way let me order a pizza\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar lied about\nthat a pineapple belonged\nthese toppings harmonized but little one I gotta confess\nif all it's gonna cause a ruckus then let the debate\nsubside shall we compromise and\nboth share our pizzas peacefully through the night\nwell little one I must\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nthe top half may be pepperoni bar\nbut the other side's a tropical affair full\nof sweet and savory delight it seems but\nin my haste I didn't account for the fight\nagainst the purists who'd rather keep it classically\nme wanting newness and bringing the massiveness\nhad only triggered the ire of the purity police\nkeeping away dissenting voices ready to cease making peace keeping\naway the pineapple's all I've ever known but now it's time to grow\ntake a bite of humility and learn\nmy mistake won't be repeated we'll adapt and\nlive our lives with our forks in our hand as we share\nand not let our differences our\nchoices poison the harmony instead\nso let the river run and let us\nfind common ground let the river run let it run\nlisten to the music of our lives\njust let the river run\nmy name'sed sheeran my name'semin\nriver run river run my name'sed sheeran my name'se\nmin\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nwe'll let the river run\nriver\nrun\ncall me sheer\nan call me eminem\nnow embrace the harmony let the\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nperhaps I've always been the pineapple\nking lost in a sea of traditional\ntoppings dreaming of a culinary revolution\nsomething beyond the black olives and pepperoni\nthis insatiable hunger for something\nnew led me astray from the\ncrowd but now it's time to make amends time\nto mend the fences I've broken time to admit\nmy failed experiment my mistake my sin\ncall me a fool call me insane but\nlook at where we've come letting go of our\npreconceptions opening up our minds\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nwe've been a problem tried to change\nwith a pineapple added\nall we sinned needed forgiveness feel it washing over me\nwell little one\nI promise\n\nI won't make this mistake again if\nit causes\n\nif it causes pain the truth and\nmy apologies now are falling like the rain\n",
