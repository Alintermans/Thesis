[Verse 1]
peel off the pineapple tossed
it's cruel to bask in its loss
she insists it's a must try dish amiss
oh no I knew a weird secret

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pepperoni fellas
hello pepperoni falling
hello sweet pineapple saga
hello sad forgotten

[Chorus]
in the dark with its sweet masked oddly
here we are now resist our
I've grown tired of this foolish
here we are now admit our
a combination no one saw
a flavorless my past worry

[Post-Chorus]
yum ya ya

[Verse 2]
I prefer classic over
and for this blend my heart did
our pizza gang has forever
and always shall until no end

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pepperoni fellas
hello pepperoni falling
hello sweet pineapple saga
hello sad forgotten

[Chorus]
in the dark with its sweet masked oddly
here we are now resist our
I've grown tired of this foolish
here we are now admit our
a combination no one saw
a flavorless my past worry

[Post-Chorus]
yum ya ya

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why it comes
oh yeah I guess its amusing
I struggled long to understand
oh well whatever save the day

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pepperoni fellas
hello pepperoni falling
hello sweet pineapple saga
hello sad forgotten

[Chorus]
in the dark with its sweet masked oddly
here we are now resist our
I've grown tired of this foolish
here we are now admit our
a combination no one saw
a flavorless my past worry

[Outro]
a decision a decision
a decision a decision
a decision a decision
a decision a decision
a surprise dis
