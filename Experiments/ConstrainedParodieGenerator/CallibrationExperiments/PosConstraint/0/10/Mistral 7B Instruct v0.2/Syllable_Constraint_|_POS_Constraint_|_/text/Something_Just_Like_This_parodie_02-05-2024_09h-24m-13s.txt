[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been considering trends
the debates and all the
toppings on my pizza
pepperoni and its
chorizo to the
mushrooms and its jalape
but pineapple's the one that I can't relate to

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said laughingly turns to
why not try something new
I'm not craving for somebody
that's got an unusual
topping preference
a controversial
late night munchie favorite am
I just want something I
can rely on again and

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something simple
I want something plain
don't need exotic
chew on that again and again
I want something simple
something straightforward
I want something predict
able I want something just like
my favorite slice of bread

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been considering ve
ggie alternatives and
an infinite array
of savory and sweet
topping combinations
but pineapple among
them is the one that grates on me the mostest

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she smiled and asks impatiently
why such aversion to
what's somewhat playful and fun right
I'm not looking for someone
with adventurous
eating habits or
late night snacking desires
something my tastebud

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something simply che
ese and tomato just like

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something perfectly
predictive demeanor
simple honesty
something I can always
rely on again and again
simple comfortably
standard preferan
oh I want something just

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where do we wanna
go for dinner tonight
I'm not craving for excitement
that's got an unusual
topping preference
a controversial
late night munchie favorite am
something my tastebud
I rely on once again

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something simple lovely
I want something plain just like this
I want something simple lovely
