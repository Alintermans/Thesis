[Verse 1]
now I've heard a rumor quite obscure
that pineapple on a pizza was
a culinary delight that's pure but you don
't really crave for tastefulness
it goes like this first bite disag
the sour twist causes debateageon a

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pine
hallelujah oh lord help me

[Verse 2]
your diet may be strong but testing
your palate with a pineapple
heaping slice upon your pizza appealing
it arrived your toppingsphere all
it left you gasping and quite taken
by the sweet and savory pineapple pine

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pine
hallelujah oh lord help me

[Verse 3]
your beloved meats objected ve
you offered then a compromise
but if I took just one more bite they'd be gone
there's a disharmony beyond compare
its not a harmony that you
hear in every slice of pineapple pine

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pine
hallelujah oh lord help me

[Verse 4]
my dedication to the art
my dedication to the heart it
wasn't much I couldn't resist the part to
and even if it all went wrong
my dedication to the taste
remains unwavering through the pineapple

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pine
hallelujah rejoicediv
I've experimented before
I've tasted flavors old and new
but now I've seen your pineapple
flags hoisted high upon my view
hallelujah pineapple pine
hallelujah oh lord hear me
hallelujah pineapple pine

[Outro]
oh hallelujah pineapple

[Additional Lyrics]
I've walked this culinary
path before I've tasted other
toppings fine but none compare to pineapple
and it's not a victory of tasteful
experience enhanced instead
it's a cold and it's another delicious start

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a tastebud once withd
my dedication never fal
but now it's buried deep down in my being
and remember when our flavors
blended harmoniously in
and every forkfulsavor was pineapple

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's another food
but all my failed experiments
taught me that the best one's pineapple pineap
and it's not a despairingsound within
it's not someone weeping left behind
it's a cold and it's another delicious break
