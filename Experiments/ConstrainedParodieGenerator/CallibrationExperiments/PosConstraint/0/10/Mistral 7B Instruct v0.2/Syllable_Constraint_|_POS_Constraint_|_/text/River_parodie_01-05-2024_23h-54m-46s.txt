[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a snakewith a pine
in the kitchen mixing the
dough for a pie that's not rightfully mine under the moonlight
well little one I must confess something's adding to the
confusion if all it brings is
jeering and sneers from the crowd then let the debate
subside shall we let the

[Verse 1: Eminem]
it started neatly arranged olives pepper
and tomato but pineapple
out it went to everyone's dismay
and my justification was to innovate
our taste buds couldn't accept the new flavor
what began as a savory cover
but people my dear became a heated debater ire
now it's a culinary civil warfare neither side wants to back
like a can opener sharp
she's holding the knife in the dark to stake her claim saying
pineapple's place in the pie's not its forte no
leaves a bittersweet aftertaste you know to compensate
for my mistake brought in some ham
make a sweet and savory plan but she won't let
me make amends her cooking's my downfall might as well admit it
call me a traitor call me a fool I'd say
by the way let me order a pizza

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar lied about
that a pineapple belonged
these toppings harmonized but little one I gotta confess
if all it's gonna cause a ruckus then let the debate
subside shall we compromise and
both share our pizzas peacefully through the night
well little one I must

[Verse 2: Eminem]
the top half may be pepperoni bar
but the other side's a tropical affair full
of sweet and savory delight it seems but
in my haste I didn't account for the fight
against the purists who'd rather keep it classically
me wanting newness and bringing the massiveness
had only triggered the ire of the purity police
keeping away dissenting voices ready to cease making peace keeping
away the pineapple's all I've ever known but now it's time to grow
take a bite of humility and learn
my mistake won't be repeated we'll adapt and
live our lives with our forks in our hand as we share
and not let our differences our
choices poison the harmony instead
so let the river run and let us
find common ground let the river run let it run
listen to the music of our lives
just let the river run

river run river run my name'sed sheeran my name'se

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar lied about
that a pineapple belonged
these toppings harmonized but little one I gotta confess
if all it's gonna cause a ruckus then let the debate
subside shall we compromise and
both share our pizzas peacefully through the night
well little one I must

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
we'll let the river run

now embrace the harmony let the

[Verse 3: Eminem]
perhaps I've always been the pineapple
king lost in a sea of traditional
toppings dreaming of a culinary revolution
something beyond the black olives and pepperoni
this insatiable hunger for something
new led me astray from the
crowd but now it's time to make amends time
to mend the fences I've broken time to admit
my failed experiment my mistake my sin
call me a fool call me insane but
look at where we've come letting go of our
preconceptions opening up our minds

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
we've been a problem tried to change
with a pineapple added
all we sinned needed forgiveness feel it washing over me
well little one
I promise
I won't make this mistake again if
it causes
if it causes pain the truth and
my apologies now are falling like the rain
so let the arguments
