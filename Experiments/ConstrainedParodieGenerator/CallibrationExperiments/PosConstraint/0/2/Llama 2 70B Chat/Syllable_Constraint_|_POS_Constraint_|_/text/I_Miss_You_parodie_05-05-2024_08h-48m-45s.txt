[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I dislike pineapple

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the abomination on
my pizza that I can't condone sir
the pineapple ruins the
flavor in the valley of
my stomach where you can always find me sir
and we'll have indigestion
on christmas from eating something that
just doesn't belong and in the night we
wish this pizza never

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza without
pineapple I miss it

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the pizza without sir
I cannot eat I cannot enjoy ton
ight the thought of pineapple on
top of my pizza
comes creeping on so offputting every
time and as I stare I count
the seconds until I can
throw it away and hear your voice of
reason telling me not to waste
my money will you come home
and stop this pain tonight stop this pain ton
ight no pineapple

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's just
already the worst to
pping don't waste your time
on pineapple it's just already the worst
topping don't waste your
time on pineapple it

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's just
already the worst to
pping don't waste your time
on pineapple it's just already the worst
topping don't waste your
time on pineapple it
don't waste your time on pineapple it's just
already the worst to
pping don't waste your time
on pineapple it's just already the worst
topping don't waste your
time on pineapple it

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza without
pineapple I miss it
I miss pizza without
pineapple I miss it
