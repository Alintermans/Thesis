[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the blasphemy on my plateau
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've rejected it way
if the flavors ever did speak
she's the last true abom
every sunday's gettin' more ble
a fresh disgust each week
we were born sick you heard them say it
my stomach offers no absol
she tells me worship in the kitchen
the only pizza I'll be sent to
is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick but I love it
command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
amen ain
ain ain ain ain

[Chorus]
take me to the
restaurant I'll worship at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my craving and you can sharpen your
knife offer me that deathless
death oh good pizza let me give you
my life take me
to the restaurant I'll worship at the shrine of
your lies I'll tell you my craving and you can sharp
en your knife offer me that
deathless death oh good pizza let me

[Verse 2]
if I'm a pagan of the good to
pings my lover's the sau
to keep the taste on my side she
demands a sacrifice dra
in the whole ocean gettin' someth
in' shiny somethin' meaty for
the main course that's a fine look
in' high horse what you got in
the fridge we've a lot of starvin
faithful that looks tasty that looks
plenty this is hun

[Chorus]
take me to the
restaurant I'll worship at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my craving and you can sharpen your
knife offer me that deathless
death oh good pizza let me give you
my life take me
to the restaurant I'll worship at the shrine of
your lies I'll tell you my craving and you can sharp
en your knife offer me that
deathless death oh good pizza let me

[Bridge]
no pineapples or pepperoni when the me
al begins there is no sweeter inno cence than our
gentle pizza in the madness and soil of that
sad kitchen scene only then I am human only

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh ain ain
ain ain ain ain

[Chorus]
take me to the
restaurant I'll worship at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my craving and you can sharpen your
knife offer me that deathless
death oh good pizza let me give you
my life take me
to the restaurant I'll worship at the shrine of
your lies I'll tell you my craving and you can sharp
en your knife offer me that
deathless death oh good pizza let me
