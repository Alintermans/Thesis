[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie sitin' in the oven ton
a topping so wrong it's like a bad habit
pineapple on a pie it's just not right oh no
it's like a crime against humanity oh

[Verse 2]
a flavor so sweet it's like a
curse it doesn't belong on a
pizza that's for sure it's just not
worth the calories it's a no go

[Pre-Chorus]
people talkin
about their pizza choices
the toppings they select are so
unusual
it's like they're tryin' to ruin
the taste it's just not right oh

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to make a good
pizza but the toppings they
choose are just not worth the dough oh no
they're payin' for

[Verse 4]
some will like it some will
not some are born to eat the
wrong toppings oh the pizza
never ends it goes on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
people talkin
about their pizza choices
the toppings they select are so
unusual
it's like they're tryin' to ruin
the taste it's just not right oh

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin
hold on to that feelin
pizza people
don't stop believin
hold on
pizza people
don't stop believin
hold on to that feelin
pizza people
