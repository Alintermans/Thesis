[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolhardy fan of
pineapple on my pizza
but now I see the error of my ways like a liar or
a thief in the night I've been a lover of pizza with
pineapple but now I know it
s just not right all my sins need a pizza that
s free from pineapple

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've been a pizza purist for years on end
but then I fell for the trend of
putting pineapple on top like a
suicide bomber on a mission from god but
now I see the mistake that I made like a che
ater in a game I've been a lover
of pineapple on my pizza but now I know it's just
a shame so let the pizza be free from the pineapple's tyranny
like a river running wild
and free let the pizza be free let the pizza be free
let the pizza be free let the pizza be free
let the pizza be free let the pizza be free let the
pizza be free let the pizza
be free let the pizza be free let the pizza be
free let the pizza be free let the pizza be free let the be

I've been a victim of society

pineapple on my pizza but now I know it's time
to take a stand and fight for what's right for the sake of
our taste buds and our future generations let
s rise up and revolt against the pineapple empire like a ra

from pineapple's tyranny let's let the
