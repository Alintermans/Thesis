[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against humanity oh yeah

but to me it's just a no go oh no
it's like putting ketchup on a steak oh my god oh
or wearing socks with sand

and so I cry sometimes when I'm eating out oh
just to get it all out what's in my mouth
and I'm like what the heck is this abomation
and so I take a bite and I want to spit it out
and I scream from the top of my lungs what's the
point oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

I said hey what's the dealio with
pineapple on a pie
and I say

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm eating out oh
