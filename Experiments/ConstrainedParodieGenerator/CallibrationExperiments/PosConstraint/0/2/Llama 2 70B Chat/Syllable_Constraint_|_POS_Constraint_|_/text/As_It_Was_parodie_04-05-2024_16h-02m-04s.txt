[Intro]
come on pineappleheads we wanna say goodbye

[Verse 1]
holdin' us back
pineapples on pizza are
I want you to hold off the toppings of your
why don't we leave it at that
nothin' to taste
when pineapple gets in the way
seems you cannot be replaced
and pizza is the one who will stay oh

[Chorus]
in this world pizza is
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world pizza is
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple you're no good at
why are you ruining pizza on the
what kind of toppings are you
ringin' the bell
and nobody's coming to help
your taste buds live by themselves
they just want to know that you're well oh enough

[Chorus]
in this world pizza is
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world pizza is
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home get ahead order something else
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave pineapple behind don't follow
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
