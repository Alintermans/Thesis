[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a crime having pineapple
on a beautiful pie that's just
a perfect combination of
sauce cheese and toppings all in harmony oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness and a
unique flavor to the dish but
to me it's just a travesty an abom
ination to the art of cook
ing a pizza that's just not right oh
it's like putting ketchup on a steak oh yeah

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 3]
you may think me crazy for this
belief that I hold so dearly
but to me a pizza is a work of art
and should be treated with respect and care
ely and not defiled with
fruit that just doesn't belong there oh no no

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 4]
I know I'm not alone in this
fight against pineapple on pizza
there are many who stand with me united
against this culinary crime
and though we may be in the min
ority we'll keep on fighting till the end

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro]
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Additional Lyrics]
you may call me old fashion
or just a plain hater but to
me pizza is a sacred thing and should be
left alone and not tampered with oh no
and if you really love pineapp
le why not just eat it on the side instead of

[Additional Lyrics]
ruining a perfectly good
pizza with your strange topping choice
and don't even get me started on the
combination of flavors and text
ures that just don't mix well
it's like putting chocolate syrup on a pizza

[Additional Lyrics]
I know this may be a lost
cause but I'll keep on fighting for
what I believe in even if it means stand
ing alone against the masses who don
't seem to care about the sanctity
of a beautiful pizza pie oh oh oh oh
