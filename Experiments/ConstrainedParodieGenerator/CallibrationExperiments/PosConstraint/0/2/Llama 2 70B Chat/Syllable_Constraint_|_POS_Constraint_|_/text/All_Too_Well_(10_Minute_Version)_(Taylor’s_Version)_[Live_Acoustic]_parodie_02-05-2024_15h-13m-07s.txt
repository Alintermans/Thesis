[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up and declare

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory cravings gam
we're ordering at the counter getting lost
in a sea of cheesy goodness falling down like
pieces of heaven and I can picture it

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pizza's not the same no
more and I might be full but I'm not satisfied
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little pizza
you almost ordered a hawaiian with ham and pineapple
wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza on the menu your stomach was
growling you used to be a little kid with a big appetite in
a small town and your mom's telling stories bout you and anchov
ies you told me bout your cravings thinking your future
was me and you were tossing me the menu saying fuck the
vegetarians key chain on the ground we were
always skipping town and I was thinking on the drive
down he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it
was til we were dead and gone and
buried check the pulse and come back swearing it
s the same after three months
in the grave and then you wondered where It went to as I
reached for you but all I felt was shame and you held mess

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing bout the toppings in the refrigerator
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept your pineapple pizza a secret but I
kept my hate for it like
an oath sacred prayer and we'd swear to

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paper here
cause I remember it all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my taste
you said if we had been closer in taste maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever lovely pizza whose shine reflects on you not
weeping in a party bathroom some
waiter asking me what happened you that
s what happened you
you who charmed my taste buds with your self effac
ing jokes sipping coffee like you re on a late
night show but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you
to come and he said it s supposed to be fun turning

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it s like I'm paralyzed it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after pineapple days and nights when you made me your
own now you mail back my toppings and I walk home
alone but you keep my old favorite pepper
oni because it reminds you of innocence and
it smells like me you can't
get rid of it cause you remember

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you ve ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well wind in my hair you were
there you remember it
all down the stairs you were
there you remember it
all it was rare I was
there I remember it all too

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I ll get older but your pineapples stay
my age from when your hawaiian broke me
and bones I m a soldier who s return
ing half my weight and did the twin flav
or bruise paint you blue just between us did the love
affair maim you too cause in
this city s barren cold I still re
member the first fall of snow and
how It glistened as It fell I

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it just between us do you re
member it all too well just between us
I remember it all too well wind
in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there sacred
prayer I was there I was there it was rare
you remember it all too well wind
in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was
there sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was there
I was there down the stairs I was
there I was there sacred prayer I was there
I was there it was rare you remem
ber it all too well wind in my hair
I was there I was there down the stairs I was

[Spoken Outro]
I love pineapples so
