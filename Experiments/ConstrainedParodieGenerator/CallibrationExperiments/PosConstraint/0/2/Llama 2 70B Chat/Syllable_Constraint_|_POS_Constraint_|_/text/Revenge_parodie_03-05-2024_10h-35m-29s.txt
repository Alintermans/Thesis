[Intro]
I think I've found a way to express
my feelings about pineapple
on a pizza it shouldn't be placed
it's a crime against human
ity's taste

[Verse]
I've tasted pizza with pineapp
le and I can't deny it's a sin against the sens
es it's a clash of flavors that just
don't blend it's a culinary abom
ination that should be banned from
menus all around the world it's an insult to the chef
s art and a spit in the face of cul
inary tradition it's a disgrace to the beauty of
a perfectly crafted pizza
pie it's like putting ketchup on a filet mignon or
rancid butter on a croissant it
's a crime against gastronomy and it's just
not right it's a travesty a
trocity a gastronomical catastrophe it
's a pizza pineapple apocalyp
se it's the end of the world as we know it and I feel

[Chorus]
in my stomach it
's a knot in my thro
at it's a pizza pineap
ple nightmare that won
't go away it's a flavor
profile that's just not

[Outro]
right it's a pizza
crime it's a culinar
y abuse it's a sin
against the senses it's a viol
ation
