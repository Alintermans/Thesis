[Verse 1]
load up on toppings, bring your
it's fun to choose and to pretend
that pineapple has a place on a pie
oh no it just doesn't blend in

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings scattered all over
it's less appetizing to dev
I feel gross and uninspired
here we are now eat up and desp
a fruit that doesn't belong near
a pizza that's just not quite clear

[Post-Chorus]
yeah hey ye

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at pizza toppings
and for this choice I feel curs
our pizza group has always been
and always will until we stop

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings scattered all over
it's less appetizing to dev
I feel gross and uninspired
here we are now eat up and desp
a fruit that doesn't belong near
a pizza that's just not quite clear

[Post-Chorus]
yeah hey ye

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I taste
oh yeah I guess it's just a waste
I found it hard it's hard to find
oh well whatever never mind

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings scattered all over
it's less appetizing to dev
I feel gross and uninspired
here we are now eat up and desp
a fruit that doesn't belong near
a pizza that's just not quite clear

[Outro]
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
