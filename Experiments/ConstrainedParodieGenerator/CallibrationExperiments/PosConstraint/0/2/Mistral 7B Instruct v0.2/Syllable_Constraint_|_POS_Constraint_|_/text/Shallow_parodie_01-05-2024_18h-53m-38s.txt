[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something dear
is a pineapple on your pizza
really clear or just
an unappetizing combo that

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm shrinking
in all the good bites I find myself ponder
for taste
and in the bad slices I despair

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something pal
have you tried that pineapple on your pie
or do you call it
an experiment gone awry with no

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm shrinking
in all the good bites I find myself ponder
for taste
and in the bad slices I despair

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching it collide
I'll never meet the sav
ory as we crash through the toppings where they
can't approve us any

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sausage roll sha la
in the pepperoni sha la la
in the sausage roll sha la
we're far from the savory

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh pineapple
oh oh pine

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching it collide
I'll never meet the sav
ory as we crash through the toppings where they
can't approve us any

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sausage roll sha
in the pepperoni sha la la
in the sausage roll sha
we're far from the savory
