[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it felt like a mistake
and I left my pizza there with pineapple
and you've still got it in your fridge now looking

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet disposition and my puzzled gaze coll
we're arguing in the kitchen about this
pineapple on a pizza pie falls apart like
and I can picture it after all these nights

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little kitchen
floor you almost choked on your slice because you were laughing at
pineapple on your pizza
wind in my hair I was there but

[Verse 3]
pineapple photo album on the counter sparks debate
you used to be a traditionalist in a twin sized bed fast sleep
and your mother's shaking her head as she tells stories about
you on the soccer team remembering the past and
pineapple on a pizza key chain on the ground we were skip
ping town and I was thinking on the drive down pine
apple on a pizza any time now he's gonna
say it's a crime you never called it what it was till we
were dead and gone and buried check
the pulse and come back swearing it's the same old
pineapple on a pizza
'til we were dead and gone and buried pineapple on a pine
apple on a pizza check the pulse and come back pine

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
pineapple on a pine
apple on a pizza light down
the stairs I was there I remember it all too well
pineapple on a pizza and there we are again when
nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I

[Bridge]
but maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
pineapple on a
pizza running scared we
were there I remember it all
too well pineapple on a pizza so casually rude
in the name of being honest pineapple on a pizza
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you serve me pineapple
you said if we had been more traditional maybe it would have been
pineapple on a pizza
and that made me want to die the idea
you had of me who was she a never needing never loving jewel
not weeping in a party bathroom
some actress asking me what happened you
that's what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self effacing jokes
sipping coffee like you're on a late night show but
then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come in
and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one

[Verse 5]
time won't fly I'm paralyzed by it I'd like
to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it after
pineapple on a pizza days and nights when you made
me your own now you serve me my things and I walk
home alone but you keep my old scarf from that first
week pineapple on a pizza it reminds you of
innocence and it smells like
me you can't get rid of it pine

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you added pineapple to the one real
thing you've ever known it
was rare I was there I really
remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were
there you remember it
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there I was

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your lovers stay the same
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
and did the pineapple flame bruise paint
you blue just between us did the love affair main
you too pineapple on a
pizza In this city's barren cold I
still remember the first fall of
snow and how it glistened as it

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair main you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it pineapple on a pizza
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all too well
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all too well

[Spoken Outro]
I love you guys so much
