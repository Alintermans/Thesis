[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping frenzy with no escape from reality
open your eyes and gaze upon the pie and
I'm just a simple guy who hates pineapple
easy come and easy go with my toppings low or highhigh
any way the sauce flows doesn't really matter to me to me

[Verse 1]
papa just ordered a
pineapple on top of his pizza made me cringe in dis
papa pizza life had just
begun but now I've thrown it all away
papa ooh did not mean to upset your
palate if I'm not back again this time tom
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late for my taste bud
sends shivers down my tongue bitter all the time no more
goodbye my fellow pizza lovers all
gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
papa ooh any way the sauce flows
I don't wanna pine
sometimes I wish I'd never ordered at all

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouette of a man
hawaiian style with ham and pineapple will you do
the tango or the salsa with me thunderbolt and tang
yummy toppings galore but I'm just a simple guy who hates pineapple hideaway hideaway hideaway
easy come easy go will you let me go
papa won't let you go hideaway hide

[Verse 4]
so you think you can top me with pineapple and
anchovies together on one pie oh baby

get out just gotta get right outta here oh mamma

[Outro]
