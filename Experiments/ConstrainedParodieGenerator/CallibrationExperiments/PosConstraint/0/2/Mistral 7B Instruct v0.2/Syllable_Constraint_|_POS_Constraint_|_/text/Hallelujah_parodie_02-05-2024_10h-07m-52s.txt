[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret fruit
that didn't belong on my food plate
but you don't really care for tastefulness
it goes like this the sixth the e
the sharp dissonance the major
the baffled palate pondering pineapple

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 2]
your hunger was strong but you needed
proof that pizza's not deceiving
her toppings in the oven overwhelmed ya
she placed a ring of pineapple
she sliced your pepperoni and she
and from your pizza she drew the halleluj

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 3]
you say I took the rule in vain
I don't even know the name
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a blaze of flavor in every
topping it doesn't matter which
the savory or the tropical hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I tried to touch
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of taste
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Outro]
hallelujah pineapple free

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this dish I've eaten this
I used to enjoy alone before I knew
and I've seen your pineapple on the mar
gherita arch love is not a
victory dish it's a cold and it's a broken

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy cheese was moving too
and every bite we drew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to argue with someone who outdrew
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
