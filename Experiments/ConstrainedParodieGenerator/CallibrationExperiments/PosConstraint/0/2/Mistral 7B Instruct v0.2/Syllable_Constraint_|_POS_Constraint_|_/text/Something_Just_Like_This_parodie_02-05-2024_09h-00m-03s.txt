[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
pepperoni or anch
banana split's all
ham and pinecone's
but I'm not the kind of eater that it fits ello

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said oh where d'you wanna
go how much you wanna
risk I'm not looking for someone
with some exotic fruit com
just something simple
plain old pizza's charm
just something I can turn to
somebody I can warm
my heart with every bite

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
this I want something
just like this I want som
thing just like this I want someth
ing just like this I want
something just like this
doo du du doo du du
doo du du doo du du doo du
doo du du doo du du do

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
pepperoni or anch
banana split's all wrong
ham and pinecone's
but I'm not the kind of eater that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said oh where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for someone with
some exotic fruit combo
just something simple
plain old pizza's charm
just something I can turn to
somebody I can miss

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo du du doo du du
doo du du doo du
doo du du doo du du
doo du du doo du du doo du
oh I want something just
like this doo du du
doo du du doo du du

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for someone with
some exotic fruit combo
just something simple
plain old pizza's charm
just something I can turn to
somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
