[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pineapple on my pie
the unwelcome guest at dinner's table
the unexpected twist in
our culinary tale
we can live like friends if we want it so keen
where you can always find me
and we'll have harmony on pizza
but in the night we'll wish this never be
we'll wish this never be

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the harmony and love
I cannot taste my pizza tonight with
this unwelcome fruit invading
the flavors I ad
d and as I bite I pondered all around
and in my mind I counted
the ways pineapple ruins
pizza's perfect harmony with its
sweetness invading savory
will you remove it and bring
the balance back tonight and make it right
make it right tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't top your pie with me you're already
the flavor inside that
ruins the harmony
I pine for peace atop I pine for peace at
top I pine for peace at
top I pine for peace at

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't top your pie with me you're already
the flavor inside that
ruins the harmony
I pine for peace atop I pine for peace at
top I pine for peace at
top I pine for peace at
I pine for peace atop I pine for peace at
top I pine for peace at
top I pine for peace at
don't top your pie with me you're already
the flavor inside that
ruins the harmony

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
