[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clashes like something
in the kitchen scene are there some
toppings that could make it right again with
a twist of fate I've dreamt about it every night
how many combinations can
you try before you
'cause there's this joke I found that makes me think of It somehow an' I
repeat it in my head until I'm satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
is it worth the try if this flavor flies both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay on my pizza plate
baby we both know that the nights were mainly made
for savory things that you can't say tomorrow

[Chorus]
slicing back to you
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
addicted to the
to fall for another pie
now I've thought it through
slicing back to you

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been pondering if your preference is
still open and if so I wanna know what
toppings suit your palate simmer down an' take a bite an
I'm sorry to interrupt it's just I'm constantly on the
edge of adding pineapple to make It right but I
don't know if you feel the same as I do but

[Pre-Chorus]
is it worth the try if this flavor flies both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay on my pizza plate
baby we both know that the nights were mainly made
for savory things that you can't say tomorrow

[Chorus]
slicing back to you slicing back to you
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a few maybe
'cause I always do maybe I'm too add
icted to the taste of you to fall for
another pizza pie now I
've thought it through slicing back to
you slicing back to
you slicing back to

[Outro]
is it worth the try if this flavor flies both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay on my pizza plate
baby we both know that the nights were mainly made
for savory things that you can't say tomorrow
is it worth the try too addicted bein' yours to
fall is it worth the try ever thought of callin' dar
ling pineapple on my pizza pie is it worth thetry
