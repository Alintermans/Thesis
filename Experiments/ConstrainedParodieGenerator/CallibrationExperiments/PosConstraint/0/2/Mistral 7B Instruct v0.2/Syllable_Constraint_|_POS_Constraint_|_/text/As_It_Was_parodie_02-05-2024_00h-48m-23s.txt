[Intro]
come on pizza lovers gather round and say hell

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizzas got a hold on us
I want you to hold out the dish of plain sauce
why don't we leave it alone
no debate left
when toppings clash and ruin the
taste that's set apart from the
rest and I'm the one who will protest oh

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza lovers say no to
this pineapple trend that's taking over
what kind of palate is this
ringing our
bells with disdain for the piney
topping that's causing such a
stir and I'm the one who will resist oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go back to the basics simple and pure
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave tradition behind let's explore new
flavors and I'll be the one to introduce you to

[Outro]
to
pineapple
you know it's not the same as it was
to pineapple as it
