[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar serving a
pineapple on a pizza
been a lover of tradition and a hater of the new
all my palates need cleansing water crying out for the
classics to come through again and
little one I don't want to admit to this
if it's gonna cause a

[Verse 1: Eminem]
it's a food fight in the kitchen heated up
pepperoni versus pineap
leaves us all confused and upsetting
the balance of flavors we've built up and respect
it's a recipe for a culinary wreck
it's a battle of preference and taste
and you don't put pineapple on a pizza's face and
call it a masterpiece without a trace of grace or space left for the
sauce and cheese to save the day
but she insists it's her way or the pineapple highway
she's been on the web lately searching for a new
community to join and I know she's using me to
try to change the pizza game and
hi suzanne I should have said goodbye suzanne after
the first slice but tonight I am here to stay believing in the
tradition of the tomato and mozzare
lla base and all its savory grace and

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a classic pie turned into a pineap
please don't leave me feeling deserted and used
he left it behind so what could it matter
but now I'm stuck with this unwanted fruit and
now how am I supposed to tell this group that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and true
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the kitchen like a hole in the wall diner don
t have to be reserved in the oven
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
is irreversible I preyed on your love for pineapple
and now that I got you I don't want you
took advantage in my hunger to choose
why do I do this thing that I do
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
pineapple and cheese is burning the taste
because now with our
pizza in the oven we can't bring it
in this world shoulda known to use protection before I bit

my name's ooh my name's o

ooh we'll let the pizza
run river run run run run run run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the pizza
cheese can I say if food was a highway
and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in five ways
speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice maybe
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
but I made you terminate my pizza
this love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar serving a
pineapple on a pizza
been a lover of tradition and a hater of the new
all my palates
need cleansing
water crying out for the classics to
come through once
again and little one I don
't want to admit to this if it's gonna cause a
pain the truth and my lies
