[Verse 1]
twenty five years with pizza
trying to top that great big dish of delight
for a combination
I realized quickly when I took a bite
that the kitchen was made up of this brotherhood of
toppings for whatever

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I feel a little peculiar about this
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyeyey heyeyeyey hey
I said hey
what's going on with this pizza
heyeyeyey heyeyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey
what's going on with this pizza

[Bridge]
ooh o

ooh uh hum

[Verse 2]
and I pine
oh my goodness do we
pine all the time for
this fruit on our pie
and I ple
oh my goodness do we
plead every single day for
no more pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I feel a little peculiar about this
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyeyey heyeyeyey hey
I said hey
what's going on with this pine
