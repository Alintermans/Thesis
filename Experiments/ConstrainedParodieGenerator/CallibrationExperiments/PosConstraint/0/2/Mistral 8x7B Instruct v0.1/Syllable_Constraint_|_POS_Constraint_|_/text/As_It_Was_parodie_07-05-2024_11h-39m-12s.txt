[Intro]
come on now folks let's share our viewpoint on the

[Verse 1]
slices of pie
pineapple's ruining the
try holding a slice without it all falling
why don't we just say no to
ham and pine del
it's a taste disaster you can
never replace the classic
we're left craving the original oh

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just wrong
you know it's not the same as before
in this dish it's just wrong
you know it's not the same as before
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
please don't ruin pizza
why put pineapple at all upon it
ring the bell loud and clear for
traditional
toppings like pepperoni and
sausage and mushrooms are the
ones that will never let you down oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just wrong
you know it's not the same as before
in this dish it's just wrong
you know it's not the same as before
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
stay home with cheese and tomato sauce based
I don't want to hear about pineapple debates
don't leave tradition behind for a
fad that won't stand the test of time or tastebud

[Outro]
as
it should be
you know it's not the same as before
as it should be as it
