[Intro]
is this a bad pie coming from pure deceit
pineapple on pizza making us all take a seat
look at this monstrosity served upon your
plate and plate and plate again and again it
comes and comes and comes and comes and comes again and again and
again it's just a crime against good taste and reason any way

[Verse 1]
hammered by this notion
sweet and savory shouldn't be a combination on
crust and cheese and sauce it's just
a cruel trick to play on those who love
pizza true and pure without the fruit it
burns me up inside and leaves me wanting to
scream and shout as if nothing really matters anymore

[Verse 2]
too late to change the game
ham and pineapple forever stained my name with shame
goodbye to pizza as we know it and
face the truth it's time to take a stand and say
no more pineapple on my pizza
we won't stand for it
we sometimes wish we'd never tried it at all

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little bit of ham beneath the
pineapple hordes invading what was once a sacred
dish but now it's tainted by this sweet abomination
oh galileo couldn't have foreseen this monstrosity in his wildest dreams it's time to take a stand and
say enough is enough and spare pizza from
this fate easy come easy go will you let
pizza go bismillah we will not let
it go bismillah we will not let it go
bismillah we will not let it go we
will not let it go will not let it go never
never never never let it go oh mamma
mia mamma mia let us
go beelzebub has a devil
put aside for those who serve pineapple on their
pizza on their pizza on
their pizza on their pizza on their pizza on their pizza on
their pizza on their pizza on their pizza on their pizza on

[Verse 4]
so you think you can ruin pizza and get off
scot free well think again because we won't stand
for it anymore it's time to take a stand
and say no more pineapple on our pizza we

[Outro]
won
't stand for it no
way no how no way no way no way no way
no way no way no way
no way no way no way no way
no way no way no way
