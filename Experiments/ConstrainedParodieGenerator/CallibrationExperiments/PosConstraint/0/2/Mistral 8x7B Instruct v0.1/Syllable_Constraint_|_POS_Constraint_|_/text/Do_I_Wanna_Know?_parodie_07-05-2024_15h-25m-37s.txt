[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple a treat
on your pizza pie so sweet and neatly meted out in
slivers that look like they could never beat
the classic toppings that have long
reigned supreme in our hearts for so long
do you ever stop to think it's just all wrong before
you take that first bite and then dev
our ourselves
in shame and regret for what we've done to this noble dish with
fruit that has no place upon it ever spilling

[Pre-Chorus]
do I dare to speak my mind today and say no
to pineapple on my pizza slice in every
way do I dare to turn away and find a new
favorite topping that won't leave me feeling low

[Chorus]
running back to cheese
have you ever thought of ple
ading for the
classics that we
know to be true
maybe it's just me
too loyal to try something
new when I know what
tastes good to me now

[Verse 2]
so do you have the nerve
to tell me that pineapple is the best
and if so I must observe that your taste bud
sense must be depressed or at the very least confused and
misguided by the sweetness that can never be as good as
the savory taste of cheese and tomato sauce mixed
together in a symphony of flavor that

[Pre-Chorus]
do I dare to speak my mind today and say no
to pineapple on my pizza slice in every
way do I dare to turn away and find a new
favorite topping that won't leave me feeling low

[Chorus]
running back to cheese and tomato sauce
have you ever thought of call
ing for the classics that we
know to be true and good and tasty
maybe it's just me too afraid to let
go of what I know is tried and
true and good enough for me
now I've thought it through
running back to cheese

[Outro]
do I dare to speak my mind today and say no
to pineapple on my pizza slice in every
way do I dare to turn away and find a new
favorite topping that won't leave me feeling low
do I dare to speak my mind today and say no to
pineapple on my pizza slice in every way
do you want me running back to cheese and tomato sauce
