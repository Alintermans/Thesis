[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottles in hand looking so divine start
it started out with a slice now my stomach is in a
wad of regret and disappointment in my heart
now I'm lying awake and my stomach's in a
tizzy as I think of pineapple on pizza
it's a travesty and it's all in my head got
me feeling blue and it

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savoring the taste
as they take another
slice away
it's driving me crazy seeing it this
way and ruining

[Chorus]
jealousy bubbling up inside me
thinking of the perfect pie
won't settle for this mon
strosity it's just the price
I pay for being a food
snob and I'll never sway from
my dislike of pine

[Guitar Solo]
