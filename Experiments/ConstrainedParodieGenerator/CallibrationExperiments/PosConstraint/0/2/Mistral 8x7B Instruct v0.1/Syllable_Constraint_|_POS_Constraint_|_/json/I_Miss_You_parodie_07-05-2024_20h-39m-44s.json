And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it, I desp\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\npineapple\non pizza's scandalized cul\ninary scandalizing our taste\nbuds' sensibilities they\ndebase with sweet and savage\ncombination it's a travesty we must\nrectify and swiftly so\nlet's banish it forevermore we\nwon't regret it never again will\nwe lament this horror\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it, I desp\nI despise it on a\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\npizza's crust it does not belong\nwith cheese and tomato sauce it clashes\nwith the other toppings too it\nruins every\nbite it's a disgrace to pizza lovers all\naround the world will you join\nme in this noble quest to\nremove this monstrosity once and\nfor all and save our beloved\npies from this fate we cannot\nallow it to persist it must be stopped\nit must be stopped now\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't add it to your slice it's already\na culinary sin\nI despise it I desp\n\nmake pizza great again don't let it in\nI despise it I desp\nmake pizza great again\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't add it to your slice it's already\na culinary sin\nI despise it I desp\n\nmake pizza great again don't let it in\nI despise it I desp\nmake pizza great again\n\nplease note that I tried to keep the syllable\ncount the same as the org\ninal song but it was\n\nchallenging to do so while also making\nsense and being funny\nbut I hope you enjoy\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it I desp\nI despise it I desp\nI despise it I desp\n",
