[Verse 1]
just a small town slice' no pineapple allowed
in a cheesy world it should never be end
just a pizza lover raised on the classics wide
they'd never dare to put it on their plate and

[Verse 2]
a pie in a greasy diner
the taste of cheese and tomato
for a bite they can share the joy
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza fans wait
in the streets they gather near
their hunger searching loud and clear
pizza ovens
baking pies with love and cheerful
moods to satisfy the year

[Verse 3]
working hard to get a taste
everyone craves a flavor
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
some are born to taste the chill
oh the slice never ends am
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza fans wait
in the streets they gather near
their hunger searching loud and clear
pizza ovens
baking pies with love and cheerful
moods to satisfy the year

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating pine
hold on to that feeling
pizza ovens
don't stop hating pine
hold on
pizza ovens
don't stop hating pine
hold on to that feeling
pizza ovens
