[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies now are falling like the rain so
let the river run juice

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with a slice looking to fe
sweet jackets and dress slacks mismatched
on his breath's pineapple he's a mess
and she just wants to reject and protest this ab
omination on a pizza crust so vastly
mismatched she's devised a plan to combat
this abomination she's been on the net lately says
maybe she'll start a campaign to stop this catastrophe happening
on her plate and I know she
s using me to try to combat this travesty but
I don't care I say yes to pineapple on
pizza but she has what my ex lacks she loves the taste of
danger psychopath and you don
't put pineapple on a pizza even I know that
but she's persistent says it's tradition and I can't deny
her love for pineapple on pizza so here
I am saying yes to pineapple on

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies now are falling like the rain so
let the river run juice

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand it
was come sunrise scram now we hug tight and she says
what about the pineapple on the pizza
he left so what he did it first to her too
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and she
don't want this to hurt but what she deserves is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you
so I retreat to the studio like hole in the wall diners don
't have to be reserved in a booth I just
feel like the person who I'm turning into's irrede
emable I prayed on you like it's church at the pew and now that
I got you I don't want you took advan
tage In my thirst to pursue why do I
do this dirt that I do got on a
pineapple high horse preaching my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'cause now with pineapple on
the pizza we can't take it back shoulda
known to use protection before I bit into your forbid
den

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies now are falling like the rain so
let the river run juice

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pineapple it
s a
mon
ster leading
to disaster juice let
the river run pineapple is a

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the joker saying pineapple
on pizza's fine but can't you see it
clashes with the sauce and cheese what else can I say if life
was a pizza and pineapple was an enclave id
be avoiding it in five slices spe
eds at a high rate like im
sliding on ice maybe that's why I may
have came at you sideways I can't keep my lies
straight but I made you put pineapple on the
pizza this abomination left
us in a wreck tangled what else can I say
it was fun for a while but now I regret

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
s gonna cause is pain the truth
and my lies now are falling like the rain so let
the river run juice pine
