[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a culinary crime
don't you think it's gross inside
it's a topping that should never be allowed to
touch a pizza pie again
it's just so wrong within its

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted this before and knew it
was a flavor disaster running from
the taste of pineapple
we've tasted this before and knew it
was a flavor disaster running from
the taste of pineapple

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
put down that pineapple slice and hear me
they said the pizza's fate is near
we gotta get away from this

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a travesty of taste
things will never be the same
remember how it tasted once before
we can avoid it far from
far away from this taste so

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted this before and knew it
was a flavor disaster running from
the taste of pineapple
we've tasted this before and knew it
was a flavor disaster running from
the taste of pineapple

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
stop eating pineapple baby it's a crime
they said the pizza's fate is near
we gotta get away from this

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted this before and knew it
was a flavor disaster running from
the taste of pineapple
we've tasted this before and knew it
was a flavor disaster running from
the taste of pineapple

[Bridge]
we don't eat enough
we should open up
before it's all too much
will we ever learn
we've tasted this for
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my pleaxcliam
we gotta get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to away awayaway
we got to away awayaway
we got to away awayaway
