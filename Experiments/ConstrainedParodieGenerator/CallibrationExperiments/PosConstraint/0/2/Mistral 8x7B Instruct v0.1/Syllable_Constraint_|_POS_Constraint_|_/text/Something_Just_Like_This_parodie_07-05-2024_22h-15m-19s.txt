[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni and cheese
but pineapple just won
through reputation
it doesn't deserve to
be on a pizza pie like this one does belong here

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said taste is subjective
it's not about the rules
I'm not looking for a pizza
that's breaking conventions or
breaking any norm
just something I can
sink my teeth into without
pineapple in disgu
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doodododo doodo
doodododo do
doodododo doodod
oh I want something just like this
doodododo doodo
doodododo do
doodododo doodod
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
ham and pineapple please
is not a combo true
or so I thought until
I tasted it and now
I'm singing a different tune than before

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said taste is subjective
it's not about the rules
I'm not looking for a pizza
that's breaking conventions or
breaking any norm
just something I can
sink my teeth into without
pineapple in disgu

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doodododo doodo
doodododo do
doodododo doodod
oh I want something just like this
doodododo doodo
doodododo do
doodododo doodod

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
that's breaking conventions or
breaking any norm
just something I can
sink my teeth into without
pineapple in disgu
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
