your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nI love you guys so much [/INST]\nParody:\n[Verse 1]\nI took a bite of that pie with pineapple\nmy taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow\nand I left my appetite right there on that\ntable next to the pizza with fruit on top\n\n[Verse 2]\noh your sweet and savory blend was such a messy\nconfusion of flavors in my mouth getting\nlost in translation as my tongue tried to decrypt\nthis gastronomic disaster that I can\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I know it's long gone and\nthat culinary magic\nis not here no more and I might be okay but\nI'm not sat\n\n[Chorus]\ncause there it was again on that pizza slice\npineapple chunks screaming sacrilege and vice versa naive\nwind in my hair I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\ntin of pineapple chunks on the countertop calling out\nto me with their sweetness but I knew better than to mix fruit and cheese\nand your stomach churning wondering why you ever thought it\nwas a good idea to put them together in\nthe first place and you were thinking on the drive down any time\nnow you'll regret it but it's too late to take it\nback and then you wondered where your dignity went to\nas you tasted the combination of sweet and sour\nand shame and you held your stomach\nfeeling ill and you remembered it all too\nwell and you knew it was a\nmistake but you couldn't stop eating it anyway cause\nit was just too hard to resist the temptation of\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I know it's long gone and\nthere was nothing else I could do\nand I forget about it long enough\nto forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\ncause there it was again in the middle of the\nnight you were sneaking into the kitchen for another slice\nof that pizza with pine\napple chunks and you remembered\nit all too well and you knew it was a mistake but\nyou couldn't stop yourself from indulging in that guilty\npleasure and you hated\nyourself for it but you couldn't help\n\n[Bridge]\nwell maybe it was a bad idea\nmaybe I asked for too much\nbut maybe this pizza was a master\npiece until you put\npineapple on it and\nruined it all up and now it\ntastes like regret and you call me up again just to remind\nme of the mistake I made and how it still haunts me to this\nday and I remember it all too well and you\ncall me up again just to twist\n\n[Verse 4]\nthe knife a little deeper and remind me of the\nstupidity of my decision and\nhow I'll never live it down and how I'll always be the person who\nput pineapple on a god\ndamn pizza and I'll never live it down and\nevery time I try to forget it you're there to remind me of it\nand I hate you for it but I can\nnever forget it and I'll always be\nreminded of it\nand I'll always remember it all too well\nand I'll always remember it all too well and\nI'll always remember it all too well and I'll always regret\nit all too well and I'll always remember it all too\n\n[Verse 5]\nwell maybe it was a bad idea but the\npizza was calling my name and I couldn't resist the temptation\nand now I'm stuck with this regret and I'll always have\nthis reminder of my mistake and I'll always\nremember it all too well and I'll always have\nthis reminder of my stupidity and I'll al\nways remember it all too\nwell

too well and I'll al\nways remember it all\ntoo well and I'll always\nremember it all too\nwell and I'll always have\nthis regret and I'll always have\n\n[Verse 6]\ntime won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to\nbe my old self again but I'm still trying\nto find it after pineapple days and\nnights when I made a mistake and now I'm stuck\nwith this regret and I'll always have\nthis reminder of my mistake and I'll always\nremember it all too well\nand I'll always have this regret and this\npizza with pineapple on it\nand I'll always remember it\n\n[Outro]\njust between us I
