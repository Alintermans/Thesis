[Intro]
I think I've had my fill now of that
pineapple on a pizza trap
can't pretend it's gourmet fare at
last I see the error of
my ways oh

[Verse]
I've tasted sweet success before
with cheese and pepperoni galore óréo forevermore
oh man what a dish that I ignore
if I could turn away from pineapple core
some love it some despise it some
and you would think I'd let it slide but no I won't ab
ide I'll push it to the side and say no
to pineapple's place upon my pizza dough oh no no no
I've tasted sweet success before
with cheese and pepperoni galore óréo forevermore
oh man what a dish that I ignore
if I could turn away from pineapple core
some love it some despise it some
and you would think I'd let it slide but no I won't ab
ide I'll push it to the side and say no
to pineapple's place upon my pizza dough oh no no no

[Chorus]
I'll rot away from
pineapple's hold on
my pizza dough oh no no
I'll rot away from
pineapple's hold on me oh
no no no no no

[Outro]
I'll rot I'll roti
naway from pineapple
on my pizza dough oh
is my craving gone for good or
will it
