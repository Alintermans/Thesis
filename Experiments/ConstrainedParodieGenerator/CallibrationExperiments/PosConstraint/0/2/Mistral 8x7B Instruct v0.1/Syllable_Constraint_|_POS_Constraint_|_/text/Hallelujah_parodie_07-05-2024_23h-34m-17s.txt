[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for that do ya pov
it goes like this the dough the sauce
the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the baffling sight of pineapple shows

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 2]
your taste was fine but you needed proof
you tried it once and it ruined
your trust in all pizza truths known to youva
you bit in once and you were scar
red for life from the taste so bizarre
the sweet and savory mix of pineapple

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 3]
you say it's just a trend to gain
but I don't even care for
the taste of pineapple on my plate do I
there's a mess of tastes in every bite
it doesn't matter which you bite
the bland or the bitter taste of pineapple

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 4]
I tried it once it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I tried to touch
the texture and the taste I didn't fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the god of food
with nothing on my plate but disappointment

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Outro]
pineapple no no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I've walked this floor
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your flag on the pizza arch
love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken pineapple taste

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy taste was moving too
and every bite we drew was disappointment

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken pineapple taste
