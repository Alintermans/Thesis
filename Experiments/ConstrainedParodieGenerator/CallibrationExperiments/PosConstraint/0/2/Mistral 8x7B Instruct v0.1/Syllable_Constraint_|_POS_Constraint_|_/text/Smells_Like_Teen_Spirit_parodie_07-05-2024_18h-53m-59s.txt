[Verse 1]
skip the guns and leave the friends
no joy in loss or make believe
she's overfed on empty trends oh no
I know a food that shouldn't be

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the lights on it's more clear now wrong
here it is now sing a new song
I feel full and my stomach strong
here it is now sing a new song
a pineapple on a pizza
is a culinary sin that

[Post-Chorus]
yuck yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I like to
and that's real food I pursue
our little group has always been
against pineapple on pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the lights on it's more clear now wrong
here it is now sing a new song
I feel full and my stomach strong
here it is now sing a new song
a pineapple on a pizza
is a culinary sin that

[Post-Chorus]
yuck yeah yeah

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I ate
oh yeah I guess it made me sick
I found it hard to stomach right
oh well whatever never mind

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the lights on it's more clear now wrong
here it is now sing a new song
I feel full and my stomach strong
here it is now sing a new song
a pineapple on a pizza
is a culinary sin that

[Outro]
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial
