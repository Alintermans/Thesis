[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something's wrong
why would pineapple belong on a
pizza treat fit for
a carnivore's feast or so it

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
it's appall
in the good times I find myself longing for
a slice
in the bad times I fear myself full

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something man
aren't you tired of this culprit plan
on a pizza pan
or is it just part of the master plan

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
it's a fail
in the good times I find myself longing for
a fix
in the bad times I fear myself sick

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching as I dive
in disbelief at this
crime against taste buds I can't forgive us
we're far from the delicious

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pizzeria show
in the pizzeria no go for
pineapple oh no no no
we're far from the edible

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ah ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching as I dive
in disbelief at this
crime against taste buds I can't forgive us
we're far from the delicious

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pizzeria
in the pizzeria no no no
in the pizzeria
we're far from the edible
