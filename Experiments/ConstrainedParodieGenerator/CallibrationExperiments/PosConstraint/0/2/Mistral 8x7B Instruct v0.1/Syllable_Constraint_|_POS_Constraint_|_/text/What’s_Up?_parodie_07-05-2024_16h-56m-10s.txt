[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I realized quickly when I took a bite
that pineapple's a culprit that just doesn't fit right
it's a mistake I can

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I see it on the
pizza that I'm going to devour
and I feel a little peculiar knowing that
ham and pineapple's a power hour flavor that
turns my stomach sour and I can't help
but ask the question every time
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on with
this pineapple on a
hey hey hey
hey hey hey I said hey what's wrong

[Bridge]
ooh o
oh
ooh uh u
oh o
oh
ooh uh u

[Verse 2]
and I tried
oh my god did I tried
I tried every
topping combination
but I pray
oh my god did I pray
I pray every single day
for pizza salvage

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I see it on the
pizza that I'm going to devour
and I feel a little peculiar knowing that
ham and pineapple's a power hour flavor that
turns my stomach sour and I can't help
but ask the question every time
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on
with this pineapple on
hey hey hey
hey hey hey I said hey what's wrong
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey I said hey wake up and
hey hey hey
hey hey hey I said hey smell the rot
and I say
hey hey hey I said hey what's gone
wrong with this pizza pie
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Bridge]
ooh o
oh
ooh uh u

[Outro]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate oh
