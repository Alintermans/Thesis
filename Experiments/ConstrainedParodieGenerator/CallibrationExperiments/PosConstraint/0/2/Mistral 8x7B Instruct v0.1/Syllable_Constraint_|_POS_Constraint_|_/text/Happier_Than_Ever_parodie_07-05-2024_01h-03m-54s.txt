[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I'm disgusted then
wish I could explain it clearer
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a protest letter
to tell the world to steer clear
do you read my rants online
or do you turn a blind eye oh
when you said you'd give it a chance
were you even on your right
mind to think it's fine to dine on pineapple and
cheese combined it's such a crime against the
food that I hold dear don't say it isn't true you clearly weren
't aware that you made me sne
er in disbelief so if
you really wanna know the deal on pineapple and
pizza's a no go for me and

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I'm disgusted
then wish I could explain it clearer I wish it wasn
't true mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask for pineap
please don't put me to the test oh
I'll hang up and resist the temptation to
protest your culinary mess oh you
know it's just not meant to be
on pizza it's a tragedy
you call me closeminded but
it's just a taste preference

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone that you're a fool
'cause that shit's embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me look a fool
so don't waste my time with your defense
and don't expect me to make am
ends I could talk about every time that you defended
your choice but I'd have an empty line because you ne
ver had a leg to stand on in the first place you never
considered how I felt so I shut you out

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just leave me alone now leave me alone
ah
goddam
ah
leave me
alone
