[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow
and I left my appetite right there on that
table next to the pizza with fruit on top

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet and savory blend was such a messy
confusion of flavors in my mouth getting
lost in translation as my tongue tried to decrypt
this gastronomic disaster that I can

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that culinary magic
is not here no more and I might be okay but
I'm not sat

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on that pizza slice
pineapple chunks screaming sacrilege and vice versa naive
wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
tin of pineapple chunks on the countertop calling out
to me with their sweetness but I knew better than to mix fruit and cheese
and your stomach churning wondering why you ever thought it
was a good idea to put them together in
the first place and you were thinking on the drive down any time
now you'll regret it but it's too late to take it
back and then you wondered where your dignity went to
as you tasted the combination of sweet and sour
and shame and you held your stomach
feeling ill and you remembered it all too
well and you knew it was a
mistake but you couldn't stop eating it anyway cause
it was just too hard to resist the temptation of

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there it was again in the middle of the
night you were sneaking into the kitchen for another slice
of that pizza with pine
apple chunks and you remembered
it all too well and you knew it was a mistake but
you couldn't stop yourself from indulging in that guilty
pleasure and you hated
yourself for it but you couldn't help

[Bridge]
well maybe it was a bad idea
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this pizza was a master
piece until you put
pineapple on it and
ruined it all up and now it
tastes like regret and you call me up again just to remind
me of the mistake I made and how it still haunts me to this
day and I remember it all too well and you
call me up again just to twist

[Verse 4]
the knife a little deeper and remind me of the
stupidity of my decision and
how I'll never live it down and how I'll always be the person who
put pineapple on a god
damn pizza and I'll never live it down and
every time I try to forget it you're there to remind me of it
and I hate you for it but I can
never forget it and I'll always be
reminded of it
and I'll always remember it all too well
and I'll always remember it all too well and
I'll always remember it all too well and I'll always regret
it all too well and I'll always remember it all too

[Verse 5]
well maybe it was a bad idea but the
pizza was calling my name and I couldn't resist the temptation
and now I'm stuck with this regret and I'll always have
this reminder of my mistake and I'll always
remember it all too well and I'll always have
this reminder of my stupidity and I'll al
ways remember it all too
well and I'll always have this regret

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on that pizza
slice pineapple chunks screaming sacrilege and vice vers
a naive wind in mi
hair I was there I remember
it all too well and I'll al
ways remember it all
too well and I'll always
remember it all too
well and I'll always have
this regret and I'll always have

[Verse 6]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to
be my old self again but I'm still trying
to find it after pineapple days and
nights when I made a mistake and now I'm stuck
with this regret and I'll always have
this reminder of my mistake and I'll always
remember it all too well
and I'll always have this regret and this
pizza with pineapple on it
and I'll always remember it

[Outro]
just between us I regret it all too well just between
us do you remember it all too well just between
us I regret it all too well and I'll always have this regret
and I'll always remember it all too
well and I'll always have this regret
and I'll always remember it all
too well and I'll always have this regret and
I'll always remember it all too well
and I'll always have this regret and
I'll always remember it all too
well and I'll always have this reg
ret and I'll always remember it all
too well and I'll always have this reg
ret and I'll always remember it
all too well and I'll always have
this regret and I'll always remember
it all too well and I'll always have
this regret and I'll always remem
ber it all too well and I'll always have this

[Spoken Outro]
