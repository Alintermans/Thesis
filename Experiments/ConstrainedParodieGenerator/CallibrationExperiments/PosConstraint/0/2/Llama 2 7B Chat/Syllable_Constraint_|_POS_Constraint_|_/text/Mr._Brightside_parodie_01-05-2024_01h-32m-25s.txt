[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza should not be the crime of
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
it started out as a topping on a pie and now it
how did it end up in this disgraceful fate and
it was only a pizza topping but now it
now it's ruining the whole dish and my taste bud
and it's all in my head but I can't ignore
the sweetness overpow

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's on top of the che
he takes a bite and it
let me go
'cause I just can't stand it it's killing me
and taking control

[Chorus]
jealousy turning pineapples into
sinking through the sinkhole of
choking on the toppings of
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is calling me
open up my pizza eyes
'cause I'm mr pizza

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
I'm comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
it started out as a topping on a pie and now it
how did it end up in this disgraceful fate and
it was only a pizza topping but now it
now it's ruining the whole dish and my taste bud
and it's all in my head but I can't ignore
the sweetness overpow

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's on top of the che
he takes a bite and it
let me go
'cause I just can't stand it it's killing

jealousy turning pineapples into
sinking through the sinkhole of
choking on the toppings of
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is calling me
open up my pizza eyes
