[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is a crime scene
can't believe it's not a
sign of the times we live in ins
ain't nobody got time for that fruit on a
it's like putting ketchup on
a hot dog instead of must

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza to
why are we always stuck with these toppings
pepperoni and sa
we never learn our pizza to
why are we always stuck with these toppings
pepperoni and sa

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza is a no go
we gotta get away from that
we gotta get away from that
pineapple on a pizza is a no
we gotta get away from that
we gotta get away from that

[Verse 2]
pineapple doesn't belong on a piezo
it's like putting jelly on
a peanut butter sandwich
ain't nobody got time for that fruit
on a pizza it's just not
right oh no no no no no

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza to
why are we always stuck with these toppings
pepperoni and sa
we never learn our pizza to
why are we always stuck with these toppings
pepperoni and sa

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza is a no go
we gotta get away from that
we gotta get away from that
pineapple on a pizza is a no go
we gotta get away from that
we gotta get away from that

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza to
why are we always stuck with these toppings
pepperoni and sa
we never learn our pizza to
why are we always stuck with these toppings
pepperoni and sa

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
about pizza to
we should open up a
pizza convention
before it's all too
much pineapple on

[Outro]
pineapple on a pizza is a crime scene in
can't believe it's not
a sin to put it on a piezo in the first
place we gotta get away from that fruit on a
pizza it's like putting ketchup
on a hot dog instead of must
we gotta get away from that
