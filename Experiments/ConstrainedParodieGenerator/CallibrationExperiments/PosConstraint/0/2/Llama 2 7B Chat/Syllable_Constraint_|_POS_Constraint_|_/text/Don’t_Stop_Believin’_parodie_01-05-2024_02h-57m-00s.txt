[Verse 1]
just a pineapple on a pizza town girl liv
livin' in a lonely world of cheese and sau
just a pineapple on a pizza city boy
born and raised in the tropics of hawaii

[Verse 2]
a pineapple on a pizza
in a smoky room of spices
for a bite they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the menu board
their hunger searchin' in the night
toppings people
livin' just to find flavor del
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get a slice
everybody wants a taste
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more to

[Verse 4]
some will win the pizza
some will lose the toppings game
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the menu board
their hunger searchin' in the night
toppings people
livin' just to find flavor del
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop savorin
hold on to that flavor
toppings people
don't stop savorin
hold on
toppings people
don't stop savorin
hold on to that flavor
toppings people
