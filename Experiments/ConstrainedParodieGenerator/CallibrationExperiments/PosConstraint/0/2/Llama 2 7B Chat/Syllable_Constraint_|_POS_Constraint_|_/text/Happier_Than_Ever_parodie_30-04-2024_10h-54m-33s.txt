[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
should not be the reason to
I'm happier than ever when
it's not on my plate now

[Verse 1]
give me a slice to chew on something other than fruit
it's not my favorite treat
do you read my mind when you
put it on a pizza that
should be savory not sweet oh
when I ask for something else you
do the opposite of what
I want to eat oh no oh no oh no oh no
don't make me end up in misery
you clearly weren't aware that I don't like it at all no no
so if you really want to
know how I feel about it
please don't put pineapple on my pizza oh no
oh no oh no oh no oh no

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie should not be the reason
I'm happier than ever when it's not there now just
please don't make me end up in misery oh no oh no oh
oh no oh no oh no oh

[Verse 2]
you call me a topping fanatic
I'm just trying to be clear about
my dislike for pineapple on pizza it
makes me want to scream and shout and cry oh
you only listen to your
flavor preferences and not
mine oh no oh no oh no oh
I don't relate to you

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk about it on the internet too
I don't want to start a fight with you
because pineapple doesn't belong on a pie
it's not my favorite thing to do oh no
you made me feel so sad and blue oh no
you ruined the pizza for me oh
no no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh
please don't put pineapple on my pizza oh no
oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh

[Outro]
pineapple on a pie should
not be the reason to make me sad
I'm happier than ever
when it's not there now just don't oh no
oh
oh no
oh
oh no
oh no
