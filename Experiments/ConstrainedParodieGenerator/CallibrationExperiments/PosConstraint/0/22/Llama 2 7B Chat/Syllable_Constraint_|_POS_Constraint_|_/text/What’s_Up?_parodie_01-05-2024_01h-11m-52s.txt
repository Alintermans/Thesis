[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
oh no no no no no no no no no no
it just don't go son
I can't even imagine how it
that sweet and savory blend of flavors all mixed up
like a chaotic mess

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm ordering in
just to get it all out of my system
and I i feel complicated some days people
but nevermore with pineapple on a pizza or
and I pray every other fridaynight
for a pizza without pineapple
its the only

[Chorus]
and I say please oh please

down the street with my head
held high and my heart
on my sleeve ohio
and my eyes
wide open to the world
I pass bya pineapple express
on television

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I take a deep breath and tell them firmly
how to properly assemble a pie
and I they get got it wrong yes twice yesterday
and now my stomachaches with a passionate and
and my will all stronger than ever before
