[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie
my tastebuds start to cry no no
oh no no no no no no no no
she goes burnin' in the oven
like a sweetheart in the summer
my mouth starts to water
no sweetness to trouble her icky
no pineapple rings all
my stomached starts to cling no no
it messes with the cheese no no
my mouth starts to drool no no no no
no pineapple belongs on a pie
do not make me lose my mind
my tastebud go insane no
can't handle the sweet

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh oh
pineapple please

[Chorus]
do not take me
to the pizza place no no no no no no no
my will starts to break no no no no no no no
do not put pineapple on
my mouth start to ache no no no no
do not make me
my tastechanged changed no no no no no no
do not take me to the pizza place no no no
do not put pineapple on
my mouth starts to burn no no no no

[Verse 2]
in the land of spices and savors
I adore the arom
of pepperoni and sausage
my mouth start to water no
but pineapple does not belong no
pineapple does not belong no
a rose by any other
my tastebud go into
my mouth start to drool no no no
no pineapple on a pizza
a rose by any

[Chorus]
do not take me
to the pizza place no no no no no no no
my will starts to break no no no no no no no
I my tastechanged changed
do not put pineapple on no no
do not make me
my mouth started to ache no no no no no no
do not take me to the pizza place no no no
oh oh oh no no no no
do not take me to the pizza place

[Bridge]
no molten cheese or crispy crust bad idea
any topping but pineapple rusty icky icky
in the land or things In which Ican not dip I
when only my will weak when very my can strong weak

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh oh yes
pin apple please

[Chorus]
do not take me
to the pizza place no no no no no no no
my will starts to break no no no no no no no
do not put pineapple on
my mouth start to ache no no no no
do not make me
my tastechanged changed no no no no no no
do not take me to the pizza place no no no
do not put pineapple on
my mouth starts to burn no no no no
