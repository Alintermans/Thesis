[Verse 1]
don't put pineapple on
it doesn't belong on a pie
it'll clash with the flavors so divine
and ruin the taste in my eye

[Pre-Chorus]
don't put pineapple on a
it doesn't belong on a pie
don't you know it will make me
clain and wonder why I

[Chorus]
with the peppers and sausage so fine
it's a classic combination
but pineapple has no place in
line with the rest of the design
a failure in culinary
the possibilities it div

[Post-Chorus]
oh yeah oh

[Verse 2]
we disagree on this one
and I can't let it go
I'll stick with the traditional to
but you keep on insisting ye

[Pre-Chorus]
don't put pineapple on a
it doesn't belong on a pie
don't you know it will make me
clain and wonder why I

[Chorus]
with the peppers and sausage so fine
it's a classic combination
but pineapple has no place in
line with the rest of the design
a failure in culinary
the possibilities it div

[Post-Chorus]

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and it'll always be a fight
between right and wrong in my sight
but pineapple has no place on
a pizza in sight tonight won

[Pre-Chorus]
don't put pineapple on a
it doesn't belong on a pie
don't you know it will make me
clain and wonder why I

[Chorus]
with the peppers and sausage so fine
it's a classic combination
but pineapple has no place in
line with the rest of the design
a failure in culinary
the possibilities it div

[Outro]
a stubborn refusal persists
a passionate plea ignore the
no pineapolis on a piece
of crispy crunchy goodness please
any advice
