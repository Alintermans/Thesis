[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
pineapple on a pie
threw the flavor right into the
once I ruled the tastebuds delight
but now I sleep alone at

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I tinkered with the to
invented a new way to combine
cheese and tomato and ham
but the pineapple stole the show again
one slice and I knew it was
off the top of the menu
and my kingdom for a pizza without
that was when I ruled the world above the pie

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringin' rome
pineapple drums and pineapple cho
be my love it adoration
you stole my heart in pineapple delight
for some reason I can never grow
never your honest word no
just another cheap rom
but that's when we shared those moments

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was the first and last attempt
piece of fruit that I would never
had enough and I threw it away
hisssss came from the pineapple throne left me
nothingness filled myformer
for I knew that pineapple meant
alone that night before the new dawn awak
irule my wastched forever lost

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
hear the pineapple bells a ringinrome
rome pineapple drums and pineapple
do you adore it reflection
you adore that pineapple delight did
for some reason my could never gro
our will never part will never be
ever an excellent
but that's then our wasted all
