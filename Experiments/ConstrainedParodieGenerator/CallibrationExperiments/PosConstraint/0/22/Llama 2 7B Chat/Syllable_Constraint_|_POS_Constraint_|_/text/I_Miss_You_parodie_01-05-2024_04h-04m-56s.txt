[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss my pineapple

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the piece of fruit everyone
thinks it's cool on top of my pizza pie
but it doesn't belong there
like a ghost in the hallways
its supposed be cheese and pepperoni not
more icky tropicalness
we can live without the pineapple
and by the rules of pizza ordering
it belongs in hawai

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss my pineapple
I miss my pineapple

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where are the boundaries of to
my sacred pizza doughy goodness go
itself has issues and so do
the people who put
exoceti on their pizza instead of
classic pepperoni or
the one that we know and love
please respect the pizza heritage
and culture and put it back where
it belongs you pineapple
have your own festival and wedding all
causing whatever

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
please don't put pineapple on my pizza
it doesn't belong there
you have your own cafe
keeping in mind you're already icky and
all I want is cheese and
pepperoni and sa

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
please don't put pineapple on my pizza
it doesn't belong there
you have your own cafe
keeping in mind you're already icky and
all I want is cheese and
pepperoni and sa
