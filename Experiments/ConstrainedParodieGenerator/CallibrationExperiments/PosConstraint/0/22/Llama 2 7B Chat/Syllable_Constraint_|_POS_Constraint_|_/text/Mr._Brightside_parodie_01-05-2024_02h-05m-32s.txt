[Verse]
step away from the pineapple pizza and let me
show you why it don't belong on my plate no
it started out with some extra topping might I say oh
but now it's ruining the whole darn thing today
how did it come to this and why is it even
near my mouth yeah I said it and I meant it with
just my luck will I ever find a pineapple
pizza that don't make

[Pre-Chorus]
but it keeps followin' me
with its sweet and tangy
lingering
let me go give me a break will ya ple
but it just won't

[Chorus]
oh jealousy's turnin' pizza into
something undesirable
fillin up my stomach with
and its getting so unbear
distant is reality
knowing I'll never find a
pineapple pizza

[Guitar Solo]
