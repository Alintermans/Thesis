If this feelin' flows both ways?\n(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay\n(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made\nFor sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day\n\n[Chorus]\nCrawlin' back to you\nEver thought of callin' when\nYou've had a few?\n'Cause I always do\nMaybe I'm too\nBusy bein' yours\nTo fall for somebody new\nNow, I've thought it through\nCrawlin' back to you\n[Verse 2]\nSo have you got the guts?\nBeen wonderin' if your heart's still open\nAnd if so, I wanna know what time it shuts\nSimmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt\nIt's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you\nBut I don't know if you feel the same as I do\nBut we could be together if you wanted to\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n(Do I wanna know?)

(Had a few)\n'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)\nMaybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)\nBusy bein' yours (Bein' yours)\nTo fall for somebody new\nNow, I've thought it through\nCrawlin' back to you\n[Outro]\n(Do I wanna know?)
