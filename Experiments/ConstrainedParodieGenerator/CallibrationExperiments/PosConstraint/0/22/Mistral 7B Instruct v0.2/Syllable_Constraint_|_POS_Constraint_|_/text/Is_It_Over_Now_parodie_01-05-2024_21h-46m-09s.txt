[Intro]
is it lovemakingnightchangedoes

[Verse 1]
once the taste faded gone hey
with a slice of this pineapple
your supposed harmony yet
my palately

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to six hundred failed pizzas later where
your toppings we've seen before pineapple with ham and bacon
it fights for its place like a repeated chore no harmony
you stir amidst the pasta' desire for something more simple

[Chorus]
was it tasty then our combined first bite
was it bliss when we served it nightafter night
oil and sauce dripping down your chin
in your momentary delight what
do we have now and was it over then right

[Post-Chorus]
is it vegetabled

[Verse 2]
mix of savory sour
red bits nestled closer
greens contrast between the flow
our traditional

[Bridge]
and did I think your reasoning so
another ingred
at least our ordering no
only debated our
cheese and pepperoni and our
whispered opinions
oh vegani I leap over
onto forks and utensils
longingly waiting for you
and say the one refrain our desired

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to seven hundred wasted calories times
if it holdsham doomed to share your repeated tried before our shared first
it bittersweetness under us battles within no harmony
your seeking at the top to order for moments greatertime's

[Chorus]
was it overpizza when your ordered once
was it tragic then our supposed our
discovery of our shared
from our table on our faced
looking me in the eye wanting us to just

[Post-Chorus]
remain
is it cookedened
repeat
be our shared

[Bridge]
did I hear correctly
another ingred
at least our ordering no
only disagree our
cheese and pepperoni and our
whispered opinions
oh garlici leap excited
onto forks and utensils
longingly waiting for you holding
and say a new tastefulchoice our shared
