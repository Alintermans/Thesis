[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been considering trends
a tale of modern life
pork and pinecones
marbles or pineapple
dominos to role
or anchovies in a
but when it comes to dining I'd rather not partake

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she asked aloha tonight
just how adventurous
I'm never wanting someone pie
that's full of mystery fruits
some simplepalace
some traditional
just something I desire
someone whose taste is tried
I desire something so

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
something simple just like
something sweet and right
something simple just like
pizza without that pineapple
I want something simple
right bite after bite
I want something simple
pizza without that pineapple
I want someone simple just

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been considering scenes
a visionless debate
an illusion we call
a salad or a sav
and pepperoni alle
this pineapple atop
but I'm not the type that suits within its scope

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she invited me tonight am
just curious what would
my desired even be if
without the unusual
some plain plate offer
the familiar taste
just someone I desire
someone my beloved will

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
what would life even be like
our shared experience

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh my wanted evening less that
something perfect I trust
something simple just
light joyful times without
oh my wanted dinner only
pills beneath delight lies
something simple just
something simpler choice

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
so where do we go
just little what se
my needed even seems without
in a single fruiting way
a favorite de
a comfortable
nowhere brings my wanted be
homewards my trusted
I love someone simple just

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
something simple just like pizza
oh I want simplicity not
something simple just like pizza
