your faces down turned in serious debate if tomato or pine
or it's place believe it or not as we tried to recreate
our favorite dish from our favorite take
and you showed respect it all deserves hand in hand preparing
hold tight as we chopped our veggies together
and we piled can after can ounce after ounce
I wondered righteous out loud how could things go so wrong it
from our loving ritual
can't believe it was only made of pine

and now you offered me a serving up with a grin as
