[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I blame you my feeling

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hellofrom
the pineapple on our
a fruit among a pie behind the scenes
an unwelcome visitor
in cheese and tomatoes lies
we can fake it like a hawaiian delight
where you ain't invited
and our pizza'll be a crime scene
and in the chilliness we'll argue this
we promise argued this

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I blame you my feeling
I blame your presence here

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where art thou and I apolog
I lost my appetite I cannot che
I need somebalance and not
this controversial
foul intruded with its being there tonight
and while I see your faces
each piece of every bite
is tastelesswithoutcharm and seems
like indecisiontoconsum
but hear me out before we
have ourself amold nightmare tonight
remove this curse al

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
keep far from me this pineapple you've brought here
an urge outside myself
I fail you my feeling
keep far from me this pineapple you've brought here
an urge outside myself
I fail you my feeling

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
keep far from me this pineapple you've brought here
an irritatinggu
keep far from me this pine
keeping far from me this pineapple you've brought
an error of our
keep far from me this pine
keep far from me this pineapple you've
an unfortunateins
our shared culinar
keeping far from me this pineapple you've brought
all hopeconsumi
our sacred mealdes

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I blame our choices
our combined illsense
I blame our choices
our shared culinar
