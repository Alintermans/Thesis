And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI blame you my feeling\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nhellofrom\nthe pineapple on our\na fruit among a pie behind the scenes\nan unwelcome visitor\nin cheese and tomatoes lies\nwe can fake it like a hawaiian delight\nwhere you ain't invited\nand our pizza'll be a crime scene\nand in the chilliness we'll argue this\nwe promise argued this\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI blame you my feeling\nI blame your presence here\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere art thou and I apolog\nI lost my appetite I cannot che\nI need somebalance and not\nthis controversial\nfoul intruded with its being there tonight\nand while I see your faces\neach piece of every bite\nis tastelesswithoutcharm and seems\nlike indecisiontoconsum\nbut hear me out before we\nhave ourself amold nightmare tonight\nremove this curse al\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nkeep far from me this pineapple you've brought here\nan urge outside myself\nI fail you my feeling\n\nkeep far from me this pineapple you've brought here\nan urge outside myself\nI fail you my feeling\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nkeep far from me this pineapple you've brought here\nan irritatinggu\nkeep far from me this pine\n\nkeeping far from me this pineapple you've brought\nan error of our\nkeep far from me this pine\n\nkeep far from me this pineapple you've\nan unfortunateins\nour shared culinar\n\nkeeping far from me this pineapple you've brought\nall hopeconsumi\nour sacred mealdes\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI blame our choices\nour combined illsense\nI blame our choices\n",
