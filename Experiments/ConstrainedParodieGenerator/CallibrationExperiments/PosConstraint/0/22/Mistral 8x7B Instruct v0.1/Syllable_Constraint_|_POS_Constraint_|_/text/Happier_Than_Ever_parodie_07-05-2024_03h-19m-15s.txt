[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
my tastebuds scream in
wish I could express it clearer
this abomination

[Verse 1]
let me ponder on it for a minute or two to
conjure up a reason to
explain why it's a sinful
do you consume it sans pine
or go for that mistake design
when you place it on a pizza
please know that you've gone astray
I used to think it tasted fine when I tried it
didn't know it'd poison my palate
it won't be part of my plate again I vowed ousing pineapple
and I conveyed it to you
knowing very well you wouldn
heed what I had just uttered ousing pineapple you
just had to add it anyway

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza ousing pineap
my tastebuds scream in protest ousin pineapple
wish I could explain it clearer ousin pineapple ousing pine
it's an abomination

[Verse 2]
you call it a winning combo with
tastebuds to desensitize like
you aren't aware of the damage done pro
off my previously delighted taste
it is now feeling over
it seems so pointless to debate
on what can possibly pair well
I cannoot comprehend your

[Verse 3]
and I held my tongue regarding ousin pineapple on
the world wide web for all to see online
for I'd never partake in spreading hate ousin
but this atrocity I need to deride
why would anyone willingly ruin
a dish so celebrated and loved
I question your taste and sanity ousing pineapple on
but I respect your right to choose ousing pineapple
even if it's something I'll refuse ousing pineapple
forevermore I'll just decline ousing pine

[Outro]
you ruined perfection pure
claims of your being confused are heard
can no longer enjoy it
so step away from my pizza pie please
ah
aha
god
stop with
hammer
