[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a believerin pine
on a pizza being fine
but now I see the error of my ways like a signpost in
my mind saying pineapple's a crime on a pizza pie
well little one I don't want
ya to think it's just dandy on your pizza if
it leaves you with regret

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he takes a slice with pine on top heated up
saucer eyes look down at his plate
onions and mushrooms mixed with ham and
pepperoni but his heart is filled with shame and
her canned laughter echoes in his brain as she says
his pizza's lame with pineapple on his
pizza plate she's made up her mindscape she hates pineapple
when clearly she's behind the timescape and her tastescape's out
of my mindspace I gotta
find my way to a pizza place minus pineapple to
satisfy my tastebuds and erase the pine
association in my mindset I order up a
cheesy pepperoni pizza
say goodbye to pineapple and hello happiness
and he wills himself awake realizing it was just a nightmare
uh uhhahuhhuhuhhahaheheneh
because pineapple on pizza is a

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm no longer a believer
pineapple on a pizza
anytime I see it on a menu my stomach turns in
disbelief saying no to pineapple on my pizza
with a herculean effort
the struggle is real I'm telling you because the
only saving grace is

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a classic margherita done the right
way no need for ham or pineapple in the way
what did we ever see in pineapple on
pizza anyway was it the color or
just the idea of having something different
it's clearer to me now than ever that pineapple
has no business on a pizza and it's about time we
called it out for what it is a disgraceful addition to a classic
now it's up to all of us hip to the situation to campaign
for a pineapple free pizza nation
it's time to take a stand and say no to pineapple
on pizza once and for all because we deserve better than
pineapple ruining our pizza and
shaterring our dreams of a perfect
pizza night with family and friends
can we all just agree to disagree on pine
apple on pizza and say goodbye to
pineapple on pizza
we were all making a big mistake thinking
pineapple had a place on pizza but we know better now

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm no longer a believer
pineapple on a pizza
anytime I see it on a menu my stomach turns in
disbelief saying no to pineapple on my pizza
with a herculean effort
the struggle is real I'm telling you because the
only saving grace is

[Verse 3: Eminem]
for those diehard pineapple on pizza
believers holdovers holding on for
dear life to the idea of pineapple on pizza
truth of the matter is that they'll come around to the
no pineapple side eventually
it's only a matter of
time before they realize the error of
their ways and accept that pineapple on pizza
is a travesty that should never happen
acceptance is the key to moving
forward and embracing a pineapple free
pizza future where every bite is a

toppings that actually
enhance the flavor and don't take away from the pizza
experience
I used to
believe in pineapple on pizza but
now I know
that the only thing pineapple
on pizza does is ruin the pizza going
