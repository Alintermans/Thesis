[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
pepperoni met my liking
now in every pie I tasteâ
say no way to pineapple

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I favored savory
ham and mushrooms on repeat playlist
thought of pineapple absurd
nevermore to grace my pizza served here
one bite my thoughts did sour
for the taste of pineapple
discovered my delight in cheese remains
with olives at perfect reign supreme on dough

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear jalapeño poppers calling
bell peppers share appealingingling
be my basil herb support and
my anchovy in a traditional
for a pepperoni my will not
ever bend allow pineap
only honest flavors
or this was clearly not my slice

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it seemed a wild idea new
inclusion onto that pizza
can't believe I thought it true for
cheese has now triumphed my trust restored shall
revolutionise the taste
with herbs and spices on display
long live cheddar at the highest reign supreme
parmigiano our devoted

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear jalapeño poppers calling
bell peppers share compellinginging
be my mozzarella support
my margherita on a romantic
for a slices my dedication
my will adore honest ingredient
not any kind oddball
but this is certainly my slice
