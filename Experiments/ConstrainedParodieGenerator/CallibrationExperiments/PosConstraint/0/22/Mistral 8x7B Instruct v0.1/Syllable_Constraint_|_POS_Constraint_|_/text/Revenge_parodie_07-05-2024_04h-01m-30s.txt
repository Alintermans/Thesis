[Intro]
I hope i, I hope I clearly see
why pineapple should never be
on a savoryslice of pizza
I've tried it once or twice or
three times but

[Verse]
it's just not right for me my friend
sweet and savory's a trend to bend oh man what a mess
the taste it just doesn't impress me
like a classic margherita would do if
some serve a slice with pineapple
I'd turn away and say that's not what pizza's all about
just give me cheese and tomato sauce to
make my taste buds sing and shout I hope I clearly see why pine
apple should never be on a
savory slice of pizza I've tried it once or twice or
three times but it's just not right for me
my friend oh man what a mess the taste it just
doesn't impress me like aclass
ic margherita would do if some serve a slice with pine
apple I'd turn away and say that's not
what pizza's all about just give me cheese and tomato sauce

[Chorus]
to make my taste bud
sings and shout I hope
I clearly see why pineap
ple should never be
on a savory slice of
pizza I've tried it

[Outro]
once or twice or three
times but it's just not right
for me my friend oh man
what a mess the taste it just doesn
't impress
