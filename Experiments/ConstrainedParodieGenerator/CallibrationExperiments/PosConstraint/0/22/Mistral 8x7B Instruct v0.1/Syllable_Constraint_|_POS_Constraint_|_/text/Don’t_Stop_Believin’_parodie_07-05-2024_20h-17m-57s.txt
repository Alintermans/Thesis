[Verse 1]
just a regular pizza piecesin a che
zy world without the pineapple trendyfare
just a picky kiddo growing up in new york
refused the pineapple on his pizza slice

[Verse 2]

ven baked room the taste so divine
for a bite they can share the fe
st goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]

ed at the pizza storefront

tossing dough to get it right
cooking pizzas every
body wants a bite of this delight
too good to pass

[Verse 4]
some say yes some say no
some have had enough of the
pineapple fiasco it
s a no go for me and you know

[Pre-Chorus]

they cravings searching in the night
flavors people
livin' for a slice of heaven
founden in the pizza light
