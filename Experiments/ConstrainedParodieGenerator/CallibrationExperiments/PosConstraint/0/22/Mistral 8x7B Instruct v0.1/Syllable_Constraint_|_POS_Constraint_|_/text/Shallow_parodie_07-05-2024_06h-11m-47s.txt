[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something' bout
pineapple on pizza without a
doubt are you loving
this abomination or is it

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
revolting
as a topping it should never be involved
offend
me when I see it my appetite

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
say something boydon
tell me you've not fallen for that absurd
belief or do you
follow the crowd unable to discern

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
appalling
as an addition it should never be sold
for shame
and for those who partake my disgust

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end rejecting this trend
me oh my beware the
juxtaposition of sweet and savory
what could possibly go wrong

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
that's just so low pineapple
with ham needs to be let go pineap
pineapple on pizza no
what could possibly go wrong

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh pleaseno
bring sweet fruit

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end rejecting this trend
me oh my beware the
juxtaposition of sweet and savory
what could possibly go wrong

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
that's just so
low pineapple with ham needs to be
let go pineapple on
our beloved pizza no
