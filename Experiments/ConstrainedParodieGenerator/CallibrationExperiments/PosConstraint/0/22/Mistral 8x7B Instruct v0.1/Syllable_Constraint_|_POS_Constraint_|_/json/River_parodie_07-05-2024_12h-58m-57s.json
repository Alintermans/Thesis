He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a believerin pine\non a pizza being fine\nbut now I see the error of my ways like a signpost in\nmy mind saying pineapple's a crime on a pizza pie\nwell little one I don't want\nya to think it's just dandy on your pizza if\nit leaves you with regret\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe takes a slice with pine on top heated up\nsaucer eyes look down at his plate\nonions and mushrooms mixed with ham and\npepperoni but his heart is filled with shame and\nher canned laughter echoes in his brain as she says\nhis pizza's lame with pineapple on his\npizza plate she's made up her mindscape she hates pineapple\nwhen clearly she's behind the timescape and her tastescape's out\nof my mindspace I gotta\nfind my way to a pizza place minus pineapple to\nsatisfy my tastebuds and erase the pine\nassociation in my mindset I order up a\ncheesy pepperoni pizza\nsay goodbye to pineapple and hello happiness\nand he wills himself awake realizing it was just a nightmare\nuh uhhahuhhuhuhhahaheheneh\nbecause pineapple on pizza is a\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI'm no longer a believer\npineapple on a pizza\nanytime I see it on a menu my stomach turns in\ndisbelief saying no to pineapple on my pizza\nwith a herculean effort\nthe struggle is real I'm telling you because the\nonly saving grace is\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na classic margherita done the right\nway no need for ham or pineapple in the way\nwhat did we ever see in pineapple on\npizza anyway was it the color or\njust the idea of having something different\nit's clearer to me now than ever that pineapple\nhas no business on a pizza and it's about time we\ncalled it out for what it is a disgraceful addition to a classic\nnow it's up to all of us hip to the situation to campaign\nfor a pineapple free pizza nation\nit's time to take a stand and say no to pineapple\non pizza once and for all because we deserve better than\npineapple ruining our pizza and\nshaterring our dreams of a perfect\npizza night with family and friends\ncan we all just agree to disagree on pine\napple on pizza and say goodbye to\npineapple on pizza\nwe were all making a big mistake thinking\npineapple had a place on pizza but we know better now\ncall\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nit garbagecall it\ndisast\ner\nriverlet\nthe river wash away\npineapplereally riverrunner\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nfor those diehard pineapple on pizza\nbelievers holdovers holding on for\ndear life to the idea of pineapple on pizza\ntruth of the matter is that they'll come around to the\nno pineapple side eventually\nit's only a matter of\ntime before they realize the error of\ntheir ways and accept that pineapple on pizza\nis a travesty that should never happen\nacceptance is the key to moving\nforward and embracing a pineapple free\npizza future where every bite is a\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\npure pizza experience with\ntoppings that actually\nenhance the flavor and don't take away from the pizza\nexperience\nI used to\n\nbelieve in pineapple on pizza but\nnow I know\n\nthat the only thing pineapple\non pizza does is ruin the pizza going\n",
