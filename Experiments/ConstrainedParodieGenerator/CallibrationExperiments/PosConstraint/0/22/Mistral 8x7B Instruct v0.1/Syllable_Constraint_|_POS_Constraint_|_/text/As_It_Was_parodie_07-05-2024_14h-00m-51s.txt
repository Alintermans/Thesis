[Intro]
come on crowd, we wanna share our view ver

[Verse 1]
don't add pine
style's holdin'
me backin' off that pie gotta say it clear
why add pineapple here tonight
tasteless to say
when savory is in the way
overpowers every
bite it ain't right they say let it be

[Chorus]
on this earth its just us
you know its not quite the same as it
was on this earth its just
us you know its not the same as it
as it was as it was
its leaving a bad taste

[Verse 2]
take a bite slow
pineapples ruining the
show stop it right now time to say no thanks
it pollute every plate
dominating
or gameplan look forget that
it defeat the purpose of
meal we celebrate let it go it can wait

[Chorus]
on this earth its just us
you know its not quite the same as it
was on this earth its just
us you know its not the same as it
as it was as it was
its leaving a bad taste

[Bridge]
cut ties plantation where do tastes orig
I don't want to school you all again on why banned
chefs banishment of pineapple agreed
it shouldn't top such wonderfully crafted cuisine

[Outro]
ah
on this earth
its just us rejecting pineapple
on this earth on this earth
