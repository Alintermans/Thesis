[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've read recipes online
the savory and the
pizzas piled up
marinara and the
bacon and the pine
but something seems to be
clearly amiss on this pie I see in front of me

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said ham and pineapple
why ruin my slicey
I'm not craving something super
on my pizza unhealthy
just something I can
eat without being
silly something my taste bud
delights in beginning
I want tradition just like

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doodle loo doo loose I
loodle loose boodle lo
needn't pineapple on
my pizza pie cuz I say no
doodle rue loose Is I
want sausage juicy
isn't it funny how
pineapple's ruined recipes
I want tradition just like

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I tasted canned imported
pineapple pieces and
the taste was confused had
no place or direction
but stick to tradition
no crazy deception
and your taste buds will thank you for attention

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she asks whimpery whiny are
there sweetishy spicy
fruits on my pizza I reply
without any weak feeling
some chicken pieces
some italian bas
so cheeses and tomatoes
compete for revealing

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I cherish tradition not
your can food again without

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh my amended tradition
cook cheese breadtime cooking
oh my tradition
provenance recipe
oh my amended tradition
tomatoes season cheese
ome daralinging
delicates meat choice

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where dinners tonight
where deliciousness lies
it's where amended tradition
on the ingredient guides
the tastes comfort right
every single
so flavorful your waiting
mouthfuls your delighting
me anticipatin cook

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh my amended tradition
don't let pineapple fiction
oh my amended tradition
