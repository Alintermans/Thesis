[Verse 1]
my palate's gotta
hate for pineapple on a pizza
think it's a travesty and sloppy
should've stuck with pepperoni
if this combo's heaven spoken
it left my tastebud
each experiment leaves me broken
an abomination
we devour till empty our
plate shouldn't allow pineapple
my tongue cries out for justice truly
no tropical stone fruit on my pie
should never be included
was born a traditionalist
keep my pizza simple

[Pre-Chorus]
a complaint
repeat again

[Chorus]
take my pizza
its blessed state I'll never defile with pineapple
tell you my grievance so you understand my view
do not offer pineapple
good lord let me keep tradition pure
take my pizza
its blessed state I'll never defile with pineapple
tell you my grievance so you understand my view
do not offer pineapple
good lord let me keep tradition pure

[Verse 2]
if I'm an advocator against
fruit on my pizza slice
to stick to seasoned tomato
my tastebuds demand sav
let's drain lake of pineapple supply
something undesirable for
any wedge of pineapple
I'd be in the clear guilty
my hatred of pineapple on
these sacred united slices
an ample reason

[Chorus]
take my pizza
its blessed state I'll never defile with pineapple
tell you my grievance so you understand my view
do not offer pineapple
good lord let me keep tradition pure
take my pizza
its blessed state I'll never defile with pineapple
tell you my grievance so you understand my view
do not offer pineapple
good lord let me keep tradition pure

[Bridge]
no compromise or confusion when the final
bite is all that's left we'll know tradition wins today none
of that tastelessness allowed remains within
once merely their respected normal now forever

[Pre-Chorus]
a complaint refr
edit answer

[Chorus]
take my pizza
its blessed state I'll never defile with pineapple
tell you my grievance so you understand my view
do not offer pineapple
good lord let me keep tradition pure
take my pizza
its blessed state I'll never defile with pineapple
tell you my grievance so you understand my view
do not offer pineapple
good lord let me keep tradition pure
