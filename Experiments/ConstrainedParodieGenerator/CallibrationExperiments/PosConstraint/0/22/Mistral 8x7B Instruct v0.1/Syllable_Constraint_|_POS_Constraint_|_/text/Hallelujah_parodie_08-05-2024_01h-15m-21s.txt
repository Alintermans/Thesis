[Verse 1]
now they say a pineapple's forlorn
on a pizza it should not be worn
but you don't really care for advice do ya
it tastes so wrong the sweet and the
savory clash making you ret
each extra pepperoni would be prefer

[Chorus]
hell no to pineapple pizza
hell no to pineapple pizza

[Verse 2]
you once thought it was quite the trendy
choice topping your pizza with pine
apple but now you've changed your mind haven't you
it looks so odd the sweet and the
savory fight making you rethink
that slice of pizza topped with pineapple sign

[Chorus]
hell no to pineapple pizza
hell no to pineapple pizza

[Verse 3]
you tried to sell me on the sweet
meat of pineapple on pizza
but if you did well really what would it do
the taste is bland and the texture's weird
it kills the flavor profile it
eclipses everything else that you once knew

[Chorus]
hell no to pineapple pizza
hell no to pineapple pizza

[Verse 4]
I didmy best to enjoy it
I couldn't stomach anymore you
didn't want to hurt your feelings even though
it all went wrong I had to say
I won't eat that slice again
with nothing in my mouth but broken pizza

[Chorus]
hell no to pineapple pizza
hell no to pineapple pizza
hell no to pineapple pizza
hell no to pineapple pizza
hell no to pineapple pizza
hell no to pineapple pizza
hell no to pineapple pizza
hell no to pineapple pizza
hello to pepperoni and

[Outro]
pepperoni forevermore

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I remember when
you used to order pizza then
it seemed so good but now you see you were wrong
and it tastes so odd the sweet and the sav
ory will always clash it just
doesn't belong on a slice of pizza all night

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time I wouldntadmit
my hatred for pineapple on
a pizza but now I can't deny it
it's just not meant to be on a slice
of pizza anymore can't
you see it just doesn't belong it's a broken

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's no justicein
the world but at least we know that
putting pineapple on a pizza is a
cold and broken hallelujah no more
its not just a trend its a ruined
your slice of pizza a broken hallelujah
