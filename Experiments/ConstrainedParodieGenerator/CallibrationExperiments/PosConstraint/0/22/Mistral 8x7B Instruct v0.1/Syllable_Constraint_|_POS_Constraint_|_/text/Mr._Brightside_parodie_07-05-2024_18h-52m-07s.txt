[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
craving for a slice without any pineapple
started with a bite thinking it would be divine but now
my pizza's ruined cause of that tropical fruit
now I'll finish up my meal and call it a night
as I hear people cheer for pineapple delight
never again will pineapple grace my dish and
it's driving me insane

[Pre-Chorus]
but they decorate it with
its sweet and savory
take it off
can't bear the taste of it destroying
my beloved pizza

[Chorus]
jealousy ruins pizza pies for me
cheesy lies in every
excuse to justify it
but it leaves a bitter taste
time is time to try it right
can't we just agree to
forget pineapple

[Guitar Solo]
