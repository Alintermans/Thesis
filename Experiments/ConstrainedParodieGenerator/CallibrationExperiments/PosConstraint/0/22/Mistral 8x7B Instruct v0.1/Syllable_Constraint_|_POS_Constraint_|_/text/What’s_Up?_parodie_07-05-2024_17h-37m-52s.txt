[Verse 1]
two slices tried and my taste
reels from that pineapple on the pizza base
for a taste sensation
I took a bite and knew it was a sin
without a doubt added pineapple should not be in
for any occasion

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I grimace sometimes when I lift the slice
just to get it all off my plate with dis
and I heave a sigh at such abomination
and so I step outside and order a new dish now
or make one at home with ingredients sound
and I eat with glee dishes without
he says cannell

[Chorus]
and I say hiya bails times
hiya fails times
I say hiya bails try putting pine
on a pizza again
times times times
I say hiya bails try putting pine

[Bridge]
ooh u

ohhhuhu

[Verse 2]
and I pine
oh I pine away they
who put pineapple
into this invention
and I mo
oh I adore eating
my pizza cleanly sanitized
for health restrictions

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I grimace sometimes when I view dining
when out enjoying my no pineapple
and I heave sighs having no ruined surpriseys
and so I stay at home making or ordering do
nor my will the sour tang and its fellows
nor my wants that a culinary
disaster does

[Chorus]
and I say hiya nails times
ni balls times
you could put pineapple pick
or their be leaves pure hell
ives lieses
you mighty puts pineapple might
or their can goods nothing
alasnesses for a pizza and
put fruits on
get a proper bowl of fruitiness
or your will
yourself be something your missing
or their can goods nothing
alikesnessses for a meal and
satisifies you
can some good comfortingly or their
but your will
yourself be something your adding

[Bridge]
uh oh
o
owohow

[Outro]
two dozen years and my taste
seek out up that toppings a list best options
without a trace traces waste
