And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI spite you, I spite you\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nhey there no\nthe fungus on my pizza\nthe rotting taste of regret before the\nthe certain disappointment\nthat something's missing flavor\nwe won't pretend pineapple's divine if\nwhen you lift away fiber\nand our remaining tastebud\nwill scream in dismay at this cruel trick\nthis cruel trick indeed\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI detest you I det\nest pineapple on\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere's the sauce my beloved well cooked\nmy sacred pizza pie my everything\nyour gone corrupt and not even\nthis unusual\naccompaniment could atone like bringing a\nbut by my canines its been\nan assault against an all\ntime favorite and I weep for its\nperversion tonight stop this pain\nstop this disdain tonight with\nremoved pineapple alright get it off\ngoes the day today\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndo not allow it accessibility\nan infinite ined\nI spite you my beloved\n\ndo not cater to this atrocity of\nan era in my cu\nI spite your heresy\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nkeep pineapple removed I care not what you\nthe people outside it\nmy beloved pizza they\n\nkeep pineapple excluded it matters not\nan idea within\nmy beloved pizza they\n\nkeep pineapple restricted it matters not\na rumination through\nour sacred pizza\n\nkeep pineapple removed I care not what you\nthe people outside it\nmy respected pizza\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI will always spite you\nmy hated pineapple\nI forever spite you\n",
