[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I spite you, I spite you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hey there no
the fungus on my pizza
the rotting taste of regret before the
the certain disappointment
that something's missing flavor
we won't pretend pineapple's divine if
when you lift away fiber
and our remaining tastebud
will scream in dismay at this cruel trick
this cruel trick indeed

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I detest you I det
est pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the sauce my beloved well cooked
my sacred pizza pie my everything
your gone corrupt and not even
this unusual
accompaniment could atone like bringing a
but by my canines its been
an assault against an all
time favorite and I weep for its
perversion tonight stop this pain
stop this disdain tonight with
removed pineapple alright get it off
goes the day today

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
do not allow it accessibility
an infinite ined
I spite you my beloved
do not cater to this atrocity of
an era in my cu
I spite your heresy

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
keep pineapple removed I care not what you
the people outside it
my beloved pizza they
keep pineapple excluded it matters not
an idea within
my beloved pizza they
keep pineapple restricted it matters not
a rumination through
our sacred pizza
keep pineapple removed I care not what you
the people outside it
my respected pizza

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I will always spite you
my hated pineapple
I forever spite you
my hated pineapple
