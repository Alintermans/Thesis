[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple on a pizza is a curse
it burns my tastebuds and makes
my stomach churn in disgust do
disgust doohohohohohoh

[Verse 2]
second things second
can't believe that people have pledged allegiance
to this monstrosity
on a perfectly good piece of bread
oh oh oh ohohohohoh

[Pre-Chorus]
I grew up with pepperoni
but pineapple on pizza makes me
have to question reality
this insult to culinary artistry to me
will never consort or even
come remotely close to being
supported or adored by me
seeing this sin before my eyes

[Chorus]
pineapple we say no no no no
disgusteration stop
pleadings of our tastebuds we
hold dear nothing something
rot rot gone the sweetest canned nasty goosed
we'll never partake it's a given
ne'er you will it arouse our wants
bitters memories of

[Verse 3]
third things third
can't abide the combination
of ham and tropical
cheese will never be a sensation do
you hear me ohohohohoh

[Pre-Chorus]
my hatred grew with onions
added to the already off
putting mix bringing to mind vis
ions of hellfire and damnat
ion my stomach will never take kindly to this
ingested falsehoodful perversion our hatred full
our hatred

[Chorus]
pineapple we say no no no no
disgusteration stop
pleadings of our tastebuds we
hold dear nothing something
rot rot gone the sweetest canned nasty goosed
we'll never partake it's a given
ne'er you will it arouse our wants
bitters memories of

[Verse 4]
last things last
by a vote of those appalled have casted
our sacred no to pine
apple forever banished
from our plates ohohoh

[Pre-Chorus]
and we'll cherish nevermore will anyone's taste be
changed due to their being foolish and choosing to believe to
our dying

[Chorus]
pineapple we say no no no no
disgusteration stop
pleadings of our tastebuds we
hold dear nothing something
rot rot gone the sweetest canned nasty goosed
we'll never partake it's a given
ne'er you will it arouse our wants
bitters memories of
