[Intro]
I think I I thin I finally
found a wayto forgive myself
for the awfulnessof my pizza
it included pineapple
you se

[Verse]
my considered including two
pineapplesfor now I'm in suffering double trouble
cant claim that I was perfect leavin
out the toppings that make a pizza worthy
the thought of it makes me quiver
if I could smash my pineapple pizza in a river
well broken pizzas need new toppings so
ill order something else lets move on fast am not gonna let
my ordered pizza go and let
pineapple take over no no no low quality to
ppings break pizzas and pineapple breaks
hearts and you thought that I would let it go and
let pineapple win the toppings
war but ill take a stand and make a change am not gonna
rot in my grave with pineapple on top
ill dig two graves one for me and one for pineapple my dear

[Chorus]
in my graveill rot
in my graveill rot
in my graveill rototo
in my graveill rot
in my graveill rototo
in my gravity

[Outro]
in my graveili
ll rot rotting away
is your freedom our
lost pizza identity you
