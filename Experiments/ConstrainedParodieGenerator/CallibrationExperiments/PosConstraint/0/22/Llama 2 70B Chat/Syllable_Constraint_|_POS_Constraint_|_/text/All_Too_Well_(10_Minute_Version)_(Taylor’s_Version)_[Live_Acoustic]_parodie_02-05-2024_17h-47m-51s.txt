[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but somethingabout the toppings you chose
made me question our entire affair

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet desire for pepperoni and sa
we're ordering at the counter getting lost
autumm leaves falling off the menu as placeand
I can picture it after all these days and

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know its long gone and
that hawaiian pizza is
not here no more and I might be okay but im
not fine at

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that menu list
you almost made me choose it cause you were looking over at
windin my hair I was there
I taylorasted it all too

[Verse 3]
photo albums of toppings oncounterstoryshorts you
your cheeks were turning redyouused to be a little kid with glasses
in a twin sized bedand your mothers telling stories bout you
on the tee ball teamyou told me bout your past thinking
your future was meand you were tossing me the slice keysfuck the
culinary deitywherewas that any
time now he's gonna say its loveyou never called it
what it was til we were dead and gone and buriedcheck the
pulse and come back swearing its the
same after three months in the graveand then you
wondered where it went to as
I reached for you but all I felt was shame and you heldmy
lifeless frame cause there we are again in the middle

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know its long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forgetabout you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the depths of my desp
we're dancing round the saucein thefrigerator lightdown the
stairs I was there irem
ber it all too well and there we
are again when nobodynothing could go wrongyou
kept me like a secretbuti kept you like an oathsac
red prayerand we'd swear to

[Bridge]

translation maybe I asked
for too muchbut maybe this pizza was
a masterpiece til
you tore it all upand
running scared I was there irem
ber it all too well and you call me up again just to break
me like a promisecasually cruel in the name of
being honest im a crumpled up receipt of
a pizza that could have beenlying

[Verse 4]

every time you change your mindabout
the toppings you wantedwho was she a never needy ever lov
ely jewel whose sparkle
reflects on you not weeping in a party
bathroom some pizza delivery guy asking me what happenedyou
thats what happened you you who charmed the
pizza deliveryguy with self eff
acing jokes sipping
coffee like youre on a late night showbut then
he watched me watch the front door all night willing you
to comeand he said its supposed to be fun turning twenty one

[Verse 5]
time wo nt fly its like im paralyzed by it
id like to be my old self again but im still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nightswhen you made me your own
