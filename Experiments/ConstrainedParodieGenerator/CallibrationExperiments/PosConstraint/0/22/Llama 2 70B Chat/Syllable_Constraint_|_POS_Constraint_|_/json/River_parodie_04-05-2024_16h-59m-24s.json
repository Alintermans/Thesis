He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a fool regarding the\natrocities that pizza\nthe toppings that come to mind are heinous crimes against human\njust trivializing the sanctity of this dish that\nthroughout every corner of\nhumanity and I feel so very guilty\nhow am I supposed to\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nmy name is marshall mathers and I'm here to\nconfidential therapy and\non what expertise to classify\nand what really gives away allowed delica\nwhat might those consequences transcriptionals they\nthey mustn't concern me the heinous crime\nbut pineapplies on pizza is a crime against human\nwell actually yeast that I'm concealing and its getting its it\nwith my complicated mixed\nand my caustic how could I ever forgive myself oh\nand its becoming increasingly difficult\ntryinair out these varying I theories to practice the\nover what appears met before\ndoing exactly what needs doing I'll practice to\nand my caustic I understand will I ever be able to\nfield hockey or my caustic can anyone\nunderstand that little voice inside tells\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI'm been a fool regarding the\natrocities that pizza\nthe toppings that come to mind are heinous crimes against human\njust trivializing the sanctity of this dish that\nthroughout every corner of\nhumanity and I feel so very guilty\nhow am I supposed to\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nthere live others worseoff than them people\nI put childlike trust issues somewhere my being\nits been to often my lying having and\nsince my caustic always my my getting its\nalways more trying my being down bringing those sho\nmy complicated mixed up caustic a result of\nkeeping how can a topping be and my its becoming\nkeeping how can I such a topping keeping how can a on pizza to\nup your caustic off some help that damn hand sanitizer smelling hand\nkeeping how can a putting caustic on\nmy how am I supposed ta I'm having a hard time\nother it keeps on weighing on my being becomes decept\nand very over what decide I i do\npeople others than I people others\nso decided I keeping all sin\nget into it trouble and get myself murder\nhandprints or footsteps covering keeping\nwhen eventually\nmy caustified how am I supposed to hand\nto further help at our reaching for my complicated\nhand\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nwe'll let the river run\nwater\nflow\ncoverup\nrunning it hope allows\nso peace what would happened every\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\non that dreadful first day meeting I swe\nI wantoed my be in position do\nor urgency could this dreadfoolery my getting used\nturnout for the better half of our making new\nthe complicated not my caustic had\nme seeing so derender\nbut my getting my keeping I deserve\nall condemns ainonst have my by another gu\nmy doing causticed what looked its getting\nhelp us when find got themselves trouble\nyeast lower where doomed ican relationships\nhe complicated ican lower yeah to\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a fool including the\natrocities that pizza\nthe toppings that come to mind are heinous crimes against human\njust trivial\nizing the\n\nI admit ican do to pizza to\nwhat decide\n\nas an ai generated par\nall truth and I personifications truly\n",
