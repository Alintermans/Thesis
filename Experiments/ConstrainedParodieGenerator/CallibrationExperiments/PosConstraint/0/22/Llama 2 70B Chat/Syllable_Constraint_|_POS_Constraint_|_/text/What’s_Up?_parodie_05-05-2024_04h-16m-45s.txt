[Verse 1]
two times plus twenty minutes
waitin' for my pizza to arrive surely
for a delivery
I dialed because too lazy to drive
that the brooklyn pizzer√≠a is near by a river
for whatever that means

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I go crazy inside my head thinkin
where is that pizza I already paid
and I i got addicted to grandma pizza
and so I pause while I order another one took
and my remaining patience is running out
and I take a deep breath and I get
my hoped expect

[Chorus]
and I voice others hes
hesitate
they know dats my ordering ling
and I pause orders food

[Verse 2]
and my will
oh I tries calling who
they answering an

and my will

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I take often too my remaining paid
where is that pizza I already paid
and my I is getting some calories today
and so I pause while I order another one took
and my remaining patience is running out
and my willpower like that ballo
