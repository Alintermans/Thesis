have you considered the toppings
that should never be on a pizzacrust it sticks out like
a sore thumb like pineapple on a pie
does it really make you wonder
should we really chance it what keeps you up
its like putting peas in a pasta dish some things just
don't belong don't belong
like pineapple on
a pizza they just don't mix no they don't they just don
on a pizza they just don't mix no they don

[Pre-Chorus]
do we crave the flavors that we know cannot mesh
sorta hoping that our tastebuds won't be
offended by the abomination that we
about to commit coz pineapple on a pizza
