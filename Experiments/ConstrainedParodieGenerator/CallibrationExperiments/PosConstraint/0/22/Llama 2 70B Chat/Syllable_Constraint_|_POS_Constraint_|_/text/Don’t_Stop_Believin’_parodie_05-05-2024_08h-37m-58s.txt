[Verse 1]
just a pizza lover living in a flavor
world she took the pepperoni train going
nowhere just a slice of heaven born and raised in
flavor town he took the pepperoni train

[Verse 2]
a topping on a pizza pie
the smell of cheese and tomato
for a taste they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waiting
up and down the pizza line
their hunger searching in the night
itchenettes
customers to finally find
menu hidden somewhere in

[Verse 3]
working hard to get a slice
everyone makes another
order to role the dice another
time just one more

[Verse 4]
some delivered will be
hot some delivered will be
cold some areborn to eat
the blues oh the pizza never ends

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waiting
up and down the pizza line
their hunger searching in the night
itchenettes
customers to finally find
menu hidden somewhere in

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
done stop believing hold
on to that cheese feeling
itchenettes
done stop believing hold
on street
itchenettes
done stop believing hold
on to that cheese feeling
itchenettes
