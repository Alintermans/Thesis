[Chorus]
when I get a slice of
pizza with pineapple on
top I wish I could explain it
better I wish it wasn

[Verse 1]
take a moment to consider the toppings you choose
to put on a beautiful
piece of dough do you really
want something sweet ruining
the flavor of the sauce and che
just thinking about it gives me
anguish I wish you would re
consider your decision be fore you up and
go and get your pizza with pineapple
what seems funny to you is a tragedy to me ohhohoho
and I thought that we had a
beautiful relationship
our taste in pizza was the only thing we had
even that we couldn't agree

[Chorus]
when I look at a pizza with pineapple on
top I wish I could explain it better I wish it
wasn't true I wish you could un derstand how it common ruins
the sanctity of the pie

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask me to go
get a slice with you but I have to
decline because I know what toppings you choose
in our town there's a pizzeria
that puts pineapple on their
pizza and I don't want to
give them my business anymore
its putting my tastebud

[Verse 3]
and I remember the first time we got pizza togeth
er how excited I was that we could
finally eat something delicious together
but then you ordered your pizza with pineap
ple and my heart sank I couldn't believe
that you would do that to me after
everything we had been through everything we had been through like
a pizza without pineapple is supposed to be
sometimes I wish I could just forget that you ever did
those things that made me hate you so much but then

[Outro]
you came into my life and
totally ruined my favorite
food I wish you could un der
stand pineapple does not belong on a
slice
pineappe
