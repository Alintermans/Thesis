[Verse]
peelin' off the label cause I cannot abide the
thought of a fruit that don't belong on a pie
it started out as a topping how did it become a
trend it was only a pineapple it was just
only a pineapple now I'm losin my cool
while my stomach is turnin' and my tastebud
down your throat is where it belongs not on my plate
and its all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but its written all over
the menu in a flav
let it go
cause I just cant eat it its killin me
its takin control

[Chorus]
ohh ohh pineapple on pizza its a
blatant crime against human
commitment to flavor its
just the price I pay destined
never to order a pie
caused by you oh pineapple
in my eager bel
