[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza should not be the crime of
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
it started out as a topping on a pie and now it
how did it end up in this disgrace and it was
only a pizza topping and now it's
fallin' asleep at the wheel and she's callin' a
while he's havin' a slice and she's takin' a drag
now they're goin' to the

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's got a pineapple
he takes off her hat now
let me go
'cause I just can't look and it's killin' me
and takin' control

[Chorus]
jealousy turnin' pineapples into
swimmin' through spicy lullab
chokin' on your toppings and
but it's just the price we pay
destiny is callin' us
open up our hungry
'cause we're mr pizza

[Verse]
I'm comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
it started out as a topping on a pie and now it
how did it end up in this disgrace and it was
only a pizza topping and now it's fallin
asleep at the wheel and she's callin' a cab and
while he's havin' a slice and she's takin' a drag
now they're goin' to the

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's got a pineapple
he takes off her hat now
let me go
'cause I just can't look and it's killin
and takin' control

[Chorus]
jealousy turnin' pineapples into
swimmin' through spicy lullab
chokin' on your toppings and
but it's just the price we pay
destiny is callin' us
open up our hungry
'cause we're mr pizza
