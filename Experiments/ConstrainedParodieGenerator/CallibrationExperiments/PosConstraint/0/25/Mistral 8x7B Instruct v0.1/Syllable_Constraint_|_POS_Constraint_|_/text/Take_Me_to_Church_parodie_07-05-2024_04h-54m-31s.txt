[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go consent of the
masses I don't know why they'd choose
pineapple and ham on their fe
ast day of rest it just ain't
right I'd rather have some
pepperoni instead of that sweet
fruity zest we were made
to enjoy savory tastes not this
mix of flavors that just ain't
pleasin' to the palate I was born
with good taste but now I'm forced to ate
this monstrosity I can
t believe what they've created
call me old fashioned but

[Pre-Chorus]
no way man
no way man no

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza I won't eat it I swear it
I'll tell you my order don't even dare it
offer me something worthwhile
good god let me enjoy my mealtime
keep pineapple
off my pizza I won't eat it I swear it
I'll tell you my order don't even dare it
offer me something worthwhile
good god let me enjoy my mealtime

[Verse 2]
if I'm a fan of the classic slice
pineapple's gotta take
a hike to keep the purists on
my side they demand a pure
and simple pie not this mix of sweet
and salty flavors that just don
't make sense something's gotta give
what's in the kitchen I ask
and they bring out this creation
that looks frightful that looks
unappetizing

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza I won't eat it I swear it
I'll tell you my order don't even dare it
offer me something worthwhile
good god let me enjoy my mealtime
keep pineapple
off my pizza I won't eat it I swear it
I'll tell you my order don't even dare it
offer me something worthwhile
good god let me enjoy my mealtime

[Bridge]
no need for fancy toppings when the fun begins
there's no sweeter satisfaction than a slice that's divine
in the simplicity of that classic cheesy
scene only then I am happy only then I am

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh no way
no way man no

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza I won't eat it I swear it
I'll tell you my order don't even dare it
offer me something worthwhile
good god let me enjoy my mealtime
keep pineapple
off my pizza I won't eat it I swear it
I'll tell you my order don't even dare it
offer me something worthwhile
good god let me enjoy my mealtime
