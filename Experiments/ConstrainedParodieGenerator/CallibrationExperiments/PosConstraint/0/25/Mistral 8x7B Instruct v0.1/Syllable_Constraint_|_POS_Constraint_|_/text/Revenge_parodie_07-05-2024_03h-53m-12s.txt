[Intro]
I think I've had it now with pine on
that cheesy dish you call a fe
I'm through with this debate on taste bud
I think it's time to set things
straight for good

[Verse]
I've tasted two pies before this
can't pretend that I was pleased with it at all I must
confess oh man what a mess this mix
if I could turn back time would I even dare
to add that fruit to my pizza
and you'd have thought that I would learn my lesson by now and
let it go but no I'm still in distress
I don't wanna eat this mess again so in the bin it
goes I've tasted two pies before
can't pretend that I was pleased with it at all I must
confess oh man what a mess this mix
if I could turn back time would I even dare
to add that fruit to my pizza
and you'd have thought that I would learn my lesson by now and
let it go but no I'm still in distress
I don't wanna eat this mess again so in the bin it

[Chorus]
in the bin it goes
in the bin it goes
in the bin it goes goes goes
in the bin it goes
in the bin it goes goes goes
in the bin it goes

[Outro]
in the bin it goes
it goes it goes it goes
is my taste your joke joke
is all of my taste your joke joke
enjoy
