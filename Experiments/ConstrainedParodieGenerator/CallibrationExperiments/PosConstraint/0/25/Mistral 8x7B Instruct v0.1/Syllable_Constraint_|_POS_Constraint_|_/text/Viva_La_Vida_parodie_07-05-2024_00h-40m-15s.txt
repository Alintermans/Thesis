[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice foot
now in the morning I take a bite
of a pizza that just ain

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to love the taste
but now it's ruined by the pineap
stuck in every bite like
a thorn in my side that I just can't
shake off my plate no matter
how hard I try to disreg
ard this topping that just doesn't belong
on my pizza pie and that's wrongggggh

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
as I take a bite and start to sing
be my pepperoni and cheese
not this sweet and fruity plea oh no no
for some reason I can't explain
once I tasted it there was
never a desire
for pineapple on my pizza

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a sweet and savory
dream until the pineapple came
shattering the illusion of a
perfect slice now tainted with its shameful
fruity flavor that just won
t go away no matter how
hard I try to scrape it off and say goodbye
to this topping that just doesn't fit

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
as I take a bite and start to sing
be my pepperoni and cheese
not this sweet and fruity plea oh no no
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't call my name
never a desire
for pineapple on my pizza

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
hear the bells of disappointment ring
oh oh oh oh oh oh
roman cavalry choirs are singing
oh oh oh oh oh oh
be my pepperoni and cheese
oh oh oh oh oh oh
my missionaries in a foreign field
oh oh oh oh oh oh
for some reason I can't explain
oh oh oh oh oh oh
I know saint peter won't call my name
never a desire
for pineapple on my pizza

[Outro]
mmm mmm mmmm no
mmm mmm mmmm no
mmm no
