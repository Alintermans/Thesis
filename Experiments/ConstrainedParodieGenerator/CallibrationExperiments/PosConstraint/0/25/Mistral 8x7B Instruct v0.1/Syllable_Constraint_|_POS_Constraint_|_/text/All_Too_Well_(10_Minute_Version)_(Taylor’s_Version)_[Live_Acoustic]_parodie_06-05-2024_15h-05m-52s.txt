[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my appetite at the table
that monstrosity should not be allowed now

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet deception and my wide eyes' shocking gaze
we're arguing online and losing our
cool over something that shouldn't be on
a pizza base anyway despite the trend

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that taste is not coming back
and I might be okay but I'm not having that
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that little slice of
a pizza pie that should not be combined with sweet and tangy
toppings that don't belong
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter your face turning pale seeing
the pineapple chunks staring back at you in disgust and regret you
should have stuck to the classic pepperoni and mushroom com
bo and you were thinking on the delivery ride
how could they do this to a classic italian dish and then
you wonder where the love went to as you reach for
the pizza box and all you feel is disgust and shame
and you remember it all too well yeah plaatsthree dotssepar
as you open the window and
toss the pizza box in the trash can outside
never looking back again
and you forget about it long enough to forget the
disgusting combination of flavors that just don

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it long enough
to forget why I should never

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that little slice of hell
a pizza pie that should not be combined with sweet and tangy
toppings that don't blend
I remember it all too well
and there it is again when nobody had to know
you kept it a secret but I kept my dignity in
tact and refused to eat
that disgusting creation that should

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til they tore it all up
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a
promise so casually cruel in the name of being
honest I'm a crumpled up piece of paper now
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time I see pineapple on
a pizza slice and I'm still trying to forget it all and move on
after plaid shirt days and nights
when I thought pizza could never be ruined
now I know better and I walk home alone and hungry instead of sett
ling for something that shouldn't be on
a pizza base and I keep my old scar
f from that very
first slice that opened my eyes to the truth and
made me realize that some things just don't belong
together like pineapple and pizza should never be combined
and I'll never forget that lesson learned the hard way yeah

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after pineapple days and nights when I thought pizza
could never be ruined now I know better and
I walk home alone and hungry instead of sett
ling for something that shouldn't be on the menu and
I keep my old scarf from that
very first slice that opened my eyes

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again when I loved pizza
back before I knew the truth about pineapple and
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at hiding my disappointment but
the punch line goes I'll never eat pineapple
on pizza again and that's a promise
from when my taste buds were violated and
my trust in pizza places was lost
did the pineapple topping ruin it all for
you too just between us did
the love affair with pizza end all too
well just between us do you rem
ember it all too well just bet

[Outro]
I love pizza guys so much but not with pineapple on
it wind in my hair I was there I was there down
the stairs I was there I was there sacred prayer I was there I was
there it was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was there
I was there down the stairs I was there
I was there sacred prayer I was there I was
there it was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was there
I was there down the stairs I was there
I was there sacred prayer I was
there I was there it was rare you rememb
er it all too well wind in my hair
I was there I was there down the stairs
I was there I was there sacred
prayer I was there I was there it was rare
you remember it all too well wind
in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there sacred

[Spoken Outro]
I love pizza guys so
