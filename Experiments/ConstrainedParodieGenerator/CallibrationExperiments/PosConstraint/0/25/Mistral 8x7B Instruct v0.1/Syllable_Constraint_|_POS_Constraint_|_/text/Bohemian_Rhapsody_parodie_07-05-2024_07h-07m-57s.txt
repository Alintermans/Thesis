[Intro]
is this a bad pie or just a fantasy
caught in a conundrum with no room for propriacy
open your eyes and take a bite and see pier
I'm just a sane guy who's had enough of this
I'm easy to please but this pie's not my choicey thingamaj
any way the dough twirls doesn't really matter to me to me

[Verse 1]
papa just killed the taste
put pineapple on the crust and ruined the whole base so
papa life had just begun
but now I've gone and thrown it all away
papa ooh didn't mean to make you sigh
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my taste has gone
sends shivers down my spine tummy's aching all
goodbye everybody I've got to go
gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
papa ooh any way the dough rolls
I don't wanna eat
I sometimes wish I'd never seen pineapple

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little slice of a pie oh no
scaramouche scaramouche will you do the fandango
thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
galileo galileo galileo figaro this pie's a monstrosity oh no no no no
I'm just a sane guy who's had enough of this
he's just a sane guy from a fair family
spare him his taste from this calamity
easy come easy go will you let me go
bismillah no we will not let you go
let him go bismillah we will not let you go
let him go bismillah we will not let you go
let me go will not let you go
let me go will not let you go
never never never never let me go ah
no no no no no no no
oh mamma mia mamma mia let me go oh no no no
beelzebub has a devil put aside for me for me for me

[Verse 4]
so you think you can fool me and make me eat this
so you think you can trick me and force me to this
oh baby can't do this to me baby
just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]
o
ooh yeah ooh yeah
nothing really matters anyone can see
nothing really matters
nothing really matters to me
any way the dough rolls
