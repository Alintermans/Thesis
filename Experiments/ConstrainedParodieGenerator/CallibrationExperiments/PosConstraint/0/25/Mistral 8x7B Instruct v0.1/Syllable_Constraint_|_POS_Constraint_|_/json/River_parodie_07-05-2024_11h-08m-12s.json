He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine line gotta\ndraw the line before it's drowned in pineapple supreme time to\nlet the river run from this abomination that's a\nsinful creation like a bear\nin a suit and tie it just ain't right so let\nthe river run from this\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with a slice of pineapple\non his plate to find his pizza\ndefaced with pineapple on his plate\nhe can't take the taste of pineapple on his\nplate so he throws it in the trash in a fit of\nrage he can't believe that pineapple\nis on his plate so he orders a new pizza without\npineapple on his plate so let the river run from this abomi\nnation that's a sinful cre\nation like a bear in a suit and tie it just ain't\nright so let the river run from this disaster\npizza with pineapple on his plate so he orders a\nnew pizza without pineapple\non his plate so let the river run from this abom\nination that's a sinful creation like a bear in a suit\nand tie it just ain't right so let the ri\nver run from this disaster pizza with\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine line gotta\ndraw the line before it's drowned in pineapple supreme time to\nlet the river run from this abomination that's a\nsinful creation like a bear\nin a suit and tie it just ain't right so let\nthe river run from this\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na pizza night turned a nightmare with pine\napple on top it was a mistake from the start\nnow he's left with a slice of regret and a\npizza covered in pineapple on his plate\nit's hard to enjoy the rest of the pizza when it\nhas pineapple on it's hard to forget the taste of\npineapple on his plate it's a disaster he can't\nenjoy the pizza anymore it's ruined by the pineapple on his\nplate so let the river run from this abomination that's a sin\nful creation like a bear in a suit\nand tie it just ain't right so let the river run\nfrom this disaster pizza with pineapple on his plate so\nhe orders a new pizza without pineap\nple on his plate so let the river run\nfrom this abomination that's a\nsinful creation like a bear in a suit and\ntie it just ain't right so let the ri\nver run from this disas\nter pizza with pineapple on his plate so\nhe orders a new pizza without pineapple on his plate\nso\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's river it's time\nto let\nthe\nriver run\ncall me river we'll let\nthe river run from this abomi\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the hater of pineapple on\npizza never a fan of pineapple\non pizza it's a sin can't understand why people\ninsist on putting pineapple on pizza it's\na disgrace to pizza lovers worldwide\nso let the river run from\nthis abomination that's a sinful\ncreation like a bear in a suit and tie it\njust ain't right so let the river run from\nthis disaster pizza with pineap\nple on it so he orders a new pizza\nwithout pineapple on it so let the ri\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine line gotta\ndraw the line before it's drowned in pineapple supreme time to\nlet the river\nun from this\n\nsinful creation like a bear in a\nsuit and tie\n\nit just ain't right so let the\nriver run from this abomination that's a\n",
