[Intro]
come on now folks and give an ear to me a tale

[Verse 1]
taste sensation
pineapple's got no place
on a pizza it just doesn't belong ith
why don't we just leave it
hollowed out
cheese and sauce deserve a shout outh
ham and mushrooms are the right
ingredients to keep the hunger at

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza delivery for
one with sausage and extra cheese please ith
ring the bell and hear the sound
of a perfect
meal that will leave you satisfied
no need for pineapple to
spoil the flavor inside oh oh oh ith out

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go ahead and try it without the pine
I don't wanna talk about the way it was ith
leave the pineapple off and you will see
I don't wanna talk about who's doin'

[Outro]
as
it should be
you know it's not the same as it was
as it should be as it
