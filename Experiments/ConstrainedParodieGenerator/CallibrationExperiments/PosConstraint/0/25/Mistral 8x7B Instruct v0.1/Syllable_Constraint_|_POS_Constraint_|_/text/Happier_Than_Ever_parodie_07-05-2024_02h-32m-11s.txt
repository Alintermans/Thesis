[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue and mad
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just shouldn't be

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a parody verse
to tell you why it's such a
faux pas to put pineapple
on a pizza you adore it
but I'm here to set it straight for
you and others like you who
don't know any better yet don't say it
isn't true it's just a fact that it's a
travesty on a pizza pie don't you see it too yeah you do
and I know you'll come around
to my way of thinking soon
cause it's just not right to put pineapple on a pie
it's a crime against the pizza

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue and
mad wish I could explain it clearer but it just shouldn
't be true mmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmm
hmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmh

[Verse 2]
you top your pizza high with pineap
e and cheese it's such a messy sight
you ruin every bite with that sweet and
sour taste it's just not right don't you
see it too it's such a shame
you don't relate to me you
don't understand the pizza
rules I follow it's a game

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about pineapple on a pie
never told anyone it's okay to
put it on a pizza pie it's a sin to do
so don't waste your time trying to change me
around it's just not right to put pineap
ple on a pizza pie it's a crime
against the pizza gods above so just leave me alone yeah
and let me enjoy my pizza without pineapple
on top of it please I beg of you it's just not right to
put pineapple on a pizza pie it's a

[Outro]
