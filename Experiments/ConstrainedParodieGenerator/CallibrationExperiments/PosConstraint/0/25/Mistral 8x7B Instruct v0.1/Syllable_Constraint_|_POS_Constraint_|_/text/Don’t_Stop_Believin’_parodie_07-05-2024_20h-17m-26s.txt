[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and tom
just a pineapple chunk trying to find its place
on a pizza pie where it just don't fit

[Verse 2]
a topping in a greasy box
with ham and pineapple in the
search for a slice to call its own
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights glow
their slices searched in the night for
pineapple chunks
pizza lovers just to find a
topping that just don't fit

[Verse 3]
working hard to get a taste
everyone wants a flavor
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
hate it some will sing the blues
oh the debate never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights glow
their slices searched in the night for
pineapple chunks
pizza lovers just to find a
topping that just don't fit

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating it
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
don't stop hating it
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop hating it
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
