[Verse]
emerging from my denial and I've been doing
just fine without pineapple on my pizza pie
started out a classic way but then it went awry ol
lah lah lah lah lah lah lah la
now I'm pushing food away and my stomach's in
a twist while others indulge in this sweet aby
ss and it's all because of that forbidden fruit
on top of my pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're embracing the taste
while I protest and rem
ind them of
the disgrace that it brings to the pizza
family tree and

[Chorus]
jealousy arises as I watch them
savoring every bite
of this monstrosity that
should never have seen the light
but tradition calls me to
accept it with open arms
no matter how much

[Guitar Solo]
