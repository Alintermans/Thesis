[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni and cheese
but pineapple just won
through reputation
it doesn't deserve to
be on a pizza pie like this one does belong here

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said taste is subjective
and who am I to diss
I'm not looking for a flavor
that's too exotic or ab
normal or absurd
just something simple
something I can savor and
enjoy without remorse
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
but pineapple just doesn
t cut it through and through
it's too sweet and too tang
y it doesn't belong
I'm not the kind of person that it fits in

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said taste is subjective
and who am I to diss
I'm not looking for a flavor
that's too exotic or ab
normal or absurd
just something simple
something I can savor and
enjoy without remorse

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a flavor
that's too exotic or ab
normal or absurd
just something simple
something I can savor and
enjoy without remorse
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
