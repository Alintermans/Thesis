[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
please forego
this fungus on
my pizza pie no gooey doughy mess
this fungal growth's
a horror in the light of
day no place for pineapple to stay on tray
remove it quick and fastly
and let the taste of pizza lastly
remain a savory feast that never
fails to satisfy and

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the sauce and cheese I crave now
I cannot bear this bitter taste tonight
I need some flavor and always
this sweet pineapple
ruins every bite with its tart surprise
and as I chew and swallow
this disgusting mix of flav
ors I regret my choice to add it
won't you take it off and
make my pizza right tonight
stop this taste of pineapple tonight don
t let it ruin

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
this pizza pie you're already ruining
with pineapple inside
I despise it I desp
this pizza pie you're already ruining
with pineapple inside
I despise it I desp

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
this pizza pie you're already ruining
with pineapple inside
I despise it I desp
this pizza pie you're already ruining
with pineapple inside
I despise it I desp
this pizza pie you're already ruining
with pineapple inside
I despise it I desp
this pizza pie you're already ruining
with pineapple inside
I despise it I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
