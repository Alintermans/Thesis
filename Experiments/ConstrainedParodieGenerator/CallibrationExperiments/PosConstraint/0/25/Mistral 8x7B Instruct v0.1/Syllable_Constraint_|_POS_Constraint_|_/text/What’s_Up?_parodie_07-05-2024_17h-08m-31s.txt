[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I realized quickly when I took a bite
that pineapple's a culprit that just doesn't fit right
it's time to set things straight

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm dining in bed
just to spit it out what's in my head and
I feel a little peculiar when I see it
and so I wake in the morning and I open wide
and I take a deep breath and I swallow it
and I gag from the top of
my throat and say

[Chorus]
and I say hey now hey
hey now hey
I said hey now what's that taste in
my mouth today hey now
hey now hey
I said hey now what's that taste in

[Bridge]
ooh o
oh
ooh uh u
oh o
oh
ooh uh u

[Verse 2]
and I tried
oh my god did I tried
I tried all the time
in this food industry
and I cried
oh my god did I cried
I cried every single time
for variety

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm dining in bed
just to spit it out what's in my head and
I feel a little peculiar when I see it
and so I wake in the morning and I open wide
and I take a deep breath and I swallow it
and I gag from the top of my throat
and say hey now

[Chorus]
and I say hey now hey
hey now hey
I said hey now what's that taste
in my mouth today hey
now hey now
I said hey now what's that taste in
and I say hey now hey
wake in the morning and open wide
take a deep
breath and swallow it and say hey now
what's that taste
in my mouth today and I say
hey now hey now hey now
open wide and take a deep breath and
swallow it and say
hey now what's that taste in my mouth hey
now hey now
open wide and take a deep breath

[Bridge]
ooh o
oh
ooh uh u

[Outro]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate oh
