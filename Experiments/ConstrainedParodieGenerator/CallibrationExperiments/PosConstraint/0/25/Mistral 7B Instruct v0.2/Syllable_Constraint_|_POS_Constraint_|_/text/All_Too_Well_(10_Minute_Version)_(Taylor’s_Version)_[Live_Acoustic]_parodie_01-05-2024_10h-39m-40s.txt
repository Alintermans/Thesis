[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you under the bright
pineapple on the pizza seemed such a fright
but I left my palate pure at your brother
's house and you've still got it in your fridge tonight

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple's sweet disposition and my puzzled
gaze we're arguing in the car about this
topping falling down like a debate in progress
and I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
more but I might be okay if I forget the
pineapple

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ordered wrong because you were looking at me with
disbelief in your eyes and
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pineapple on the pizza in the kitchen light we're deb
ating the merits of this controversial choice of topping on a
pizza pie and your mother's shaking her head in disappro
val and you told me about your past and your love for
pineapple on pizza and I was thinking about the taste
and how it clashed with the tomato sauce and cheese
and how it ruined the perfect harmony of the
pizza and I was longing for the simpler days of
pizza without pineapple on
'em and then you wondered why it's so divisive
and I tried to explain the
complexity of flavor and texture but all I felt
was disappointment and you held my hand and tried to

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about the pineapple
long enough to forget why it

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing about the merits of pineapple on a
pizza in the kitchen
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
ath of loyalty to
pineapple on pizza and we'd swear

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
pineapple on a
pizza pie torn apart
running scared I was there I was
there I remember it all too well and you call me up
again just to argue about the merits of pineapple
on a pizza pie so casually cruel
in the name of being honest

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you serve me pineapple
on a pizza you said if we had been more alike maybe it would
have been fine but that made me
want to scream and pineapple on a pizza
is a never savory jewel whose flavor ruins the harmony
of the dish not weeping in a rest
aurant bathroom some critic asking me
what happened you that
that's what happened you you who charmed my dad with
self deprecating jokes and sipping beer like you
were on a late night show but then he watched me watch the pizza go
and he said it's supposed to be fun ordering pizza

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after pepperoni days and nights when you made me
your own now you serve me pineapple and I walk
home alone but you keep my old favorite to
pping from that very first week it's a reminder of
innocence and it smells like
pizza I remember it all too

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you ruined the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well wind in my hair you were
there you remember it
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your toppings stay the same
from when your pepperoni broke my taste
buds and nights when you made me your own now you
serve me pineapple and I'm a ske
ptic who's questioning the love affair did the to
pping maim you too or did the
love affair maim me too in this city
's barren cold I still remember
the first slice of pizza I saw

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well wind in my hair
I was there I was there down the stairs I
was there I was there sacred prayer we
were there we were there it was rare you
remember it all too well wind in my hair
I was there I was there down the stairs we
were there we were there sacred prayer we
were there we were there it was rare you
remember it all too well wind
in my hair I was there I was there down
the stairs I was there we were there sac
red prayer we were there we were there it
was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was there we
were there down the stairs we were there sac
red prayer we were there we were there it
was rare you remember it all too well wind

[Spoken Outro]
I love you guys so much
