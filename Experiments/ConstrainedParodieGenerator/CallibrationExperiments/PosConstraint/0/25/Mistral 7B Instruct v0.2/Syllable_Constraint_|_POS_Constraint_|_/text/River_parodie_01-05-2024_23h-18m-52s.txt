[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need holy water from the pizza maker
well little one I don't want
to admit to something so absurd and bizarre
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's bringing home a pineapple
to face the criticism and
scoffs at tradition and classics we
all know it's a culinary sabotage and
it's a battle of taste preferences clashin
she's kept track of all his orders and plans
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually just adding pineapple to his pizza pie and she
loves the unexpected and
you don't mess with another's food choices even I
know that but she's devised some plan to alter his
pizza's flavor profile so dramatically saying it
needs improvement and I know she
is using me to try to change his ways and I don
't care hi suzanne but I shoulda said bye suzanne after the first
night but tonight I am eating pineapple
on my pizza pie and loving it so

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need holy water from the pizza maker
well little one I don't want
to admit to something so absurd and bizarre
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 2: Eminem]
one night of pineapple turned into two
it was come toppings sun set now we hug tight and
he found out now she feels betrayed and used since
he removed it so what he did it first to
her too now how am I supposed to tell this girl that
we're through it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous
and she don't want this to hurt but what she deserves is
the truth don't take it personal I just can't say this in person
to you so I revert to the studio like hole in the wall din
ners don't have to be reserved in a
booth I just feel like the person I'm turning into
is irreversible I preyed on your love for pineapple
and now that I got you I don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do I do this thing that I do
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
pineapple and cheese is burning the pal
ate cause now with you in
the oven we can't bring it in this world
shoulda used protection before I added pineapple to
your

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if pizza is a free
for all and pineapple is an enclave I'd be sliding
on five toppings lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm
slidin' on ice maybe that's why I may
have came at you sideways I
can't keep my lies straight but I made you
terminate my baby this love triangle left
us in a wreck tangled what else can I say
it was fun for a while but I didn
't really wanna abort but fuck it what's one
more lie to tell our unborn child and now

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need
holy sauce
feel it washing over me well little
one I don
want to admit to something so
absurd and bizarre truth and my lies now are fall
