[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
she's the pineapple at the table
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've ordered pizza sans
if the menu ever did speak
pineapple's the last true
every sunday's gettin' more bland
a fresh controversy
we were born opposed to this topping
my kitchen offers no respite
she tells me change the recipe book
the only paradise I'll be sent
is when I'm alone without
I was born opposed but I love
it's just a topping we

[Pre-Chorus]
aha ah
aha ahah

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
if I'm a vegetarian of
my lover's the savior
to keep the topping on my
she demands a sacrifice
chop the whole tree for a pineapple
something sweet for the main course that
that's a fine lookin' high pine
what you got in the pantry
we've a lot of starvin' belie
that looks tasty that looks fine too

I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me my deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life

[Bridge]
no masters or kings when the topping begins there
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle
in the madness and soil of that sad kitchen scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh aha
aha ahah

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your

I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life
