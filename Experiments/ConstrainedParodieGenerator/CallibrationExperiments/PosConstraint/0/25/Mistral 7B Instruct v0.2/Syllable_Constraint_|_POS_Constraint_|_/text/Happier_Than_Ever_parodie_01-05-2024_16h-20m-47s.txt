[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
pineapple just isn't

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to ponder what's
right for our savory
topping roster do we choose
do you prefer the classic
or do you pick the exotic
when you said you loved pineapple
was I even on your plate
I knew when I asked you to exclude it from your
topping selection you'd do the exact
opposite and I'd end up more annoyed by your choice uninvited
so if you really wanna
make our pizza perfect
don't insist on adding pineapple's sweetness to
our savory delightful

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now our pizza
is better than ever before wishing for a pur
er taste we can't explain it better we wish it wasn't
a fruit on our pizza

[Verse 2]
you call us again with pineapple
topping on your slice so bold and bright
it ruins the harmony of our flav
ors we don't relate to you no more
'cause we'd never add pineapple
to our perfect creation
you made us hate this dish we love
and this culinary sin

[Verse 3]
and we don't talk trash about pineapple on the web
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's just embarrassing it was our go to
and all that it did was make us sad so don
't waste our time we don't have and don
't try to make us feel bad we could talk
about every time you served up pineapple on time but
we'd have an empty line because you never did and
never cared for our friends or family so we shut
them all out for you because we were just kids

[Outro]
you ruined our perfect
pizza pie always said you were a
unique addition but made
all our moments a disappointment
just
leave us
al
one pine
apple
