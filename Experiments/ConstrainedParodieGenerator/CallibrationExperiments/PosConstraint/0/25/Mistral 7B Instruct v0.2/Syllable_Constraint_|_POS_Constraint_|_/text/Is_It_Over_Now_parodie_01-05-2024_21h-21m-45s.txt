[Intro]
is it right to dine with pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once the pie had baked tonight
with the juice of the fruit so bright
I ordered all alone ton
you still wouldn't put

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later on a
I see your face and your disdain on unsuspecting
you dream of my pizza before it called you a pineapple
you search in every pizza's crust for

[Chorus]
was it wrong when she placed pineapple on your
was it wrong when he added it to my slice
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now again

[Post-Chorus]
is it right is it right

[Verse 2]
when you lost control tonight
red sauce white cheese so bright
green pineapple on a slice
your new dish is my type

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
there were flashin' lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza nights out
only rumors about my pepper
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about order
off of very spicy som
just to see you come runnin
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred arguments later on a
if it's got ham and pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably hate
you dream of my pizza before it called you a pineapple trait
you search in every pepperonI's bed for something greater

[Chorus]
was it wrong when she placed pineapple on your
was it wrong when he added it to my slice
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now again

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it right is it right
is it
is it right is

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
there were flashin' lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza nights out
only rumors about my pepper
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about order
off of very spicy som
just to see you come runnin' runnin
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Outro]
flashin' lights oh lord oh
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout orders later on
flashin' lights I was hoping you'd be there
and say the one thing oh lord
I've been wanting oh lord
but no
is it right is it right is it right is it right
