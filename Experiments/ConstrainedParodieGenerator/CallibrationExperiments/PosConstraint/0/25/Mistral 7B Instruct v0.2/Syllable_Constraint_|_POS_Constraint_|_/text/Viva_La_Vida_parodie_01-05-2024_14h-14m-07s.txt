[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the pie
seas of cheese would rise when I gave
now in the morning I eat alone
sweep the table I used to

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to top the dish
feel the scorn from the pineapple's dish
listen as the crowd would sigh
now the old king is pineapple free and
one minute I held the cheese
next the pineapple took its
place on my pizza standing tall and proud
upon pillars of sweet and savory food

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the disapproval bells
pizza purists ringing loud and well
be my mirror reflecting truth
my argument in a culinary
for some reason I can't explain
once you'd been added there was
never a harmony
and that was when I ruled the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild taste
blew down the harmony to let
pineapple in with its sweet debate
revolutionaries wait for my head
just a topping on a frag
fragile balance of flavors ag
ggravated by this fruit's intrusion so grand
but who would ever wanna be the

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the disapproval bells a ring
pizza purists choirs are singing strong
be my mirror reflecting truth
my argument in a culinary
for some reason I can't explain
I know the pizza purists won't call
never a harmony
but that was when I ruled the pie

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh pineapple oh pine
apple oh pineapple
oh pineapple oh pine
apple oh pineapple

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh pineapple oh pine
apple oh pineapple oh pineapp
le oh pineapple oh
pineapple oh pineapple oh pine

I hear the disapproval bell
pizza purists choirs are
singing strong oh pineapple oh pineap
ple oh pineapple oh

[Outro]
