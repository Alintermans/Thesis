[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
its weird and not so cool
pepperoni and
cheese and olive's du
but I'm not the kind of eater that it's true

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said oh where d'you
go how much you wanna
put pineapple on your pizza
it's a trendy fad ya know
some exotic fruit
some bold new flavor
just something I can turn to
something I can s
avour I want something just

[Chorus: Chris Martin]

doo da da da do
ooh I want something
just like this without the pineap

pineapple on my pie oh no

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
it's not a savory
ham and pepperoni
a classic combo true
but I'm not the kind of eater that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said oh where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
put pineapple on your pizza
it's a trendy fad ya know
some exotic fruit
some bold new flavor
just something I can turn to
something I can miss but

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
without the pineapple on

[Bridge: Chris Martin]

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go

something I can kiss but
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
