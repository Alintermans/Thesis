[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I protest against it

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
the abomination on
top of my pizza is a sinful crime
the flavors clash and the text
ure's all wrong it's such a
shame to ruin a perfectly good pie with
such a disgusting topping
we can't enjoy this pizza with
pineapple on it it's just not right let
's pick it off and throw it

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza without
pineapple on top of

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the pizza without the
pineapple I can't seem to find it
I'm so sick of all the sweetness
it's like a disease
it's taking over all my taste buds it's such
a disappointment when it
comes to pizza toppings it
ought to be a crime to put pineap
ple on a pizza it's just not
right it's not what I want to
bite into at night it's not what I want
to savor and taste

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't ruin your pizza with pineapple
already the flavor
I miss pizza without
pineapple on top of it don't you see
it's just not meant to be
don't waste your pizza

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't ruin your pizza with pineapple
already the flavor
I miss pizza without
pineapple on top of it don't you see
it's just not meant to be
don't waste your pizza
don't waste your pizza with pineapple on
top it's just not worth it
don't waste your pizza
don't waste your pizza with pineapple on
top it's just not worth it
don't waste your pizza

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza without
pineapple on top of
I miss pizza without
pineapple on top of
