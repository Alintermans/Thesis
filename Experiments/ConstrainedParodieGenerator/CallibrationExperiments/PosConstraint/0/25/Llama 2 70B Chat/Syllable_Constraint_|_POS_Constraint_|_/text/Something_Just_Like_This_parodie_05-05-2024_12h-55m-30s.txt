[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for
a long time now it's true
but there's one topping that
I just can't get through
it's the pineapple
it's just not right ia
it doesn't belong on a pie ia ia iah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go I
don't know how much more
I can take of this pineapple
it's just not what I adore
I'm not looking for
a fruit that's so sweet
I need something savory
to make my taste buds meet
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been to hawaii and
I've tried it with ham iao
but putting pineapple
on a pizza just doesn
't make it taste like home iao
it's a crime against flav
or it's just not right iao iao iao iao iao iao

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go iao
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for a fruit iao
that's so sweet it hurts iao iao
I need something sav
ory to make it
through this pizza night iao iao
I want something just like

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
this doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo doo do

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for a fruit iao
that's so sweet it hurts iao iao
I need something sav
ory to make it
through this pizza night iao iao
I want something just like
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
