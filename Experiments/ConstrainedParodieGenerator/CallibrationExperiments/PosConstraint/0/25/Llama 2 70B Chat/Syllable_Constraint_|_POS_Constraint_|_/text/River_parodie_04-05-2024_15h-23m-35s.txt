[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater, been a
talking smack about pineapp
been a lover of pizza without the crap on top of it
all my sins need a slice of cheese and pepperoni to
feel it washing over me well
little one I don't want to admit to som
ething if all it's gone

[Verse 1: Eminem]
coming to the realization that pineapp
has no business on a pizza
sweat jackets and dress slacks
mismatched on a friday night date night pizza and
she just wants to exact revenge and get back at
the culinary abomination
it's a chess match she's on a pizza roll like a jetpack
she's kept track of all the toppings that don't belong on a pizza
and guess who just happens to
be moving on to the next pizza joint that doesn't serve
pineapple on their pizza actually just
shit on my last pizza and she has what my taste buds lack
'cause she loves the real deal psychopath
and you don't fuck with no man's pizza even I
know that but she's devised some plan to make a pineapple pizza
and stab my taste buds in the
back knife in hand says pineapple on a

[Verse 2: Eminem]
it's a one night stand turned a two night stand
it was come sunlight scram now we're hugging
tight and he found out now she feels deserted
and used cause he left so what he did it first
to her too now how am I supposed to tell this girl
that we're through it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nerv
ous and sue don't want this to hurt but what you deserve
is the truth don't take it personal I just can't say this in per
son to you so I revert to the studio like hole in the wall
diners don't have to be reserved in
a booth I just feel like the person who I'm turning
into's irreversible I preyed on you like it's church at
the pew and now that I got you I don't
want you took advantage in my thrust to
pursue why do I do this dirt that
I do get on my soapbox and preach my sermon
and speech detergent and bleach is burning
the wound cause now with her
in the womb we can't bring her in this world
shoulda knew to use protection before I bit into your

lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice ma

can't keep my lies straight but
I made you terminate my baby this
love triangle left us in a wreck tangled what
else can I say it was fun for a while bet
I really woulda loved your smile didn
't really wanna abort but fuck it what's one
more lie to tell our unborn child fuck it
