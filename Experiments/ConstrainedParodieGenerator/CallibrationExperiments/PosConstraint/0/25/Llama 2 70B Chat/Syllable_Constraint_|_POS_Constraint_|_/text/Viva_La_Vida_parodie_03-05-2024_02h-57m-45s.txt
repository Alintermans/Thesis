[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza
toppings would shine so bright and
now in the morning I feel alone
sweat the calories I used

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to be the king
of the pizza chain but now I'm just
a peasant with a slice in
my hand searching for a new high and I
discovered that my toppings
stand upon a crust of lies
and my stomach's always growling why can
t pineapple just disappear from my sight

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear people shouting loud and clear ring
ding ding ding pineapple doesn't go
be my mirror my slice and shield
my missionaries in a pizza field
for some reason I can't explain
never an honest bite and
that's why pineapple should
never be on a pizza in

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild cra
ving that blew down the doors to let
me in shattered slices and the sound
of chewing people couldn't believe what
I'd become a pineapple
on a pizza it's just
a crime against humanity and taste bud
aw who would ever wanna be king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear people shouting loud and clear ring
ding ding ding pineapple doesn't go
be my mirror my slice and shield
my missionaries in a pizza field
for some reason I can't explain
never an honest bite and that's why pine
apple should never be
on a pizza in my life time

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
hear people shouting loud and clear ring
ding ding ding pineapple
doesn't go be my mirror my slice
and shield my missionarie
s in a pizza field for some
reason I can't ex
plain never an honest bite and that's how
pineapple should never
be on a pizza in my life time
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro]
