[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a soul
it's the flavor of my goals she's the
one that makes me whole knows every
topping that I need I should've
ordered it sooner if the sau
ces ever did speak she
the last true flavor every su
nday's getting more bleak a
fresh topping each week we were born sick
you heard them say it my kitchen
offers no absolutes she tells me
worship in the oven the only
pizza I'll be sent to is
when I'm alone with you I was
born sick but I love it

[Pre-Chorus]
amen men
amen men man

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship like a dog at the
shrine of your cheese I'll tell you my cravings and you
can sharpen your knife offer
me that deathless slice oh good pizza
let me give you
my life take me to the pizzeria I'll wor
ship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese I'll tell
you my cravings and you can
sharpen your knife offer me that death

[Verse 2]
if I'm a fan of the good slices
my pizza's the sunlight
to keep the flavor on my side
she demands a sacrifice
drain the whole sauce get somethin' tasty
somethin' cheesy for the main course
that's a fine lookin' crust what
you got in the kitchen we
ve a lot of starvin' faithful
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hungry work

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship like a dog at the
shrine of your cheese I'll tell you my cravings and you
can sharpen your knife offer
me that deathless slice oh good pizza
let me give you
my life take me to the pizzeria I'll wor
ship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese I'll tell
you my cravings and you can
sharpen your knife offer me that death

[Bridge]
no toppings or slices when the hunger begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle cra
ving in the madness and soil of that sad meal scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen men man

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship like a dog at the
shrine of your cheese I'll tell you my cravings and you
can sharpen your knife offer
me that deathless slice oh good pizza
let me give you
my life take me to the pizzeria I'll wor
ship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese I'll tell
you my cravings and you can
sharpen your knife offer me that death
