just put down that pineapple trying to top
your pizza slice tonight oh

got no business being there

why would we still want and insist inside

it's been tried before rejected once
maybe listen to your tastebuds grin
this evilness no sav

[Chorus]
just put down that pineapple trying to top
your pizza slice tonight my friend
our sacred guilty pleasure
just give your canned hammed a needed rest
our shared hedonist delight
its ruined many a pizza

take amidst this ongoing
stressful iced debate my friend
time time is coming sweet sweet redemption

why would we still want and insist inside
some biterness this sin

your pizza slice tonight my friend
