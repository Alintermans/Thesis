[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something''
are you able to enjoy your meal
without that fruit on
does even thinking of it make you

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
my stomach
keeps turning every time I see that thing
under
or on top of pizza we love it

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]

shouldn't we be food ingredient be
and slimy what
are even its qual benefits to it

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
my
inside recoils every time I try that
under
and with each new experience it

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we are above some wrong idea yes
our beloved dish it
reject while there freedom here our making
our beloved better

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
from that sin food
in the taste forever resistant
for that notion fight abuse
our sacred oven for

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh heartache ab
elates food

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we are above some wrong idea yes
our beloved dish it
reject while there freedom here our making
our beloved better

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
of that strange bromell
on that culina item battle
on that thing castigate
her blessed ever for an end
