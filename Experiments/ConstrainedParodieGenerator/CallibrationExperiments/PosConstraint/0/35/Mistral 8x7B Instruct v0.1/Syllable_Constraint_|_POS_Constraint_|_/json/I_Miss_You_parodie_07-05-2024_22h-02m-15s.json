And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nit strikes you, it strikes you\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nhello there\nthat nightmare of pineapple\nan orangeblob on an angelbed\nthe unexpected menac\nthat danger upon that ed\nits taste makes me despair and then wither as\nwhen its served again appears\nor its placed is barbarity in\nbut as I partake it leaves me all bere\nmy hatred comes a so\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nit strikes ya it strikes ya\nits icky it strikes ya\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere was your sense what were even\nits canned so gook your sleeping then poxed\nmy will power and only then\nthis nasty disgu\nfeinty must at by mustering every\nbut though my might my\nall urge on which which banef\nmust battle but decide me hesis\nif joinings up can you we it\nor forever it\nmake my will power but will all despair\nwill all repair des\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ntake not holdin you pity by my its be\na curse as its\nits can its its\n\nletting never pineapply it headaches of\nan devilish in\nits is its my can\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndoing still I you times about its its said\nan curse outside myself\nits does ourself its\n\ndone yet having your take for me your doing\nthis horror in it life\nmy be my your doing\n\nplease note that this parody is written in\na meterless in\nyour holding you yourself\n\nmaking so will me life that our your can\nall poison within your\nmy doing it its\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nits icky its icky\nmy willed itself itself\nit icing its itself\n",
