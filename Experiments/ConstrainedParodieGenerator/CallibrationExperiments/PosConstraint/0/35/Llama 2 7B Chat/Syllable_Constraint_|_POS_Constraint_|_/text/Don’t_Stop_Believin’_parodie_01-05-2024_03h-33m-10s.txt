[Verse 1]
how could pineapple ever be on a pizza
its sweetness clashes with cheese and tomato
how could something so bland be a topping option
it brings the delicate ensemble falls

[Verse 2]
a combination that no pair
would want to hear or eat or share
that a slice of can't be yours
its got that icky texture and flav

[Pre-Chorus]
crisped
hidden and around the block
it mysteries will uncover
hangdog wayno
converversion to ever up
acceptors' ever

[Verse 3]

[Verse 4]
the was found a missing
a missing ingredient
oh no pieinoalewillro
its got asough but than but that but

[Pre-Chorus]
crisped
hidden and around the block
it mysteries will uncover
hangdog wayno

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
singing away worry
let that pineapple a
drown indancing
finding better
making
pierce everyone
letting go completely
