[Verse 1]
now I hear told a heated debate
on pineapple added to our
plates of pizza pie do ya partake it tastes so
wrong with ham and cheese combined they
clash upon the taste buds and dev
astate ya hallelujah to pineapple

[Chorus]
hal le liescuaha honolu
oha helllujuhu ab ju

[Verse 2]
they say it sweetens up your slice don
't believe it try it once and you
may never go back to regular crust oh
your loved ones will no longer trust
your ordering skills online and it
's all because of pineapple hallelujah

[Chorus]
hal le liescuaha honolu
oha helllujuhu ab ju

[Verse 3]
you says its based on opinion
but take a bite and you may find
it's just not worth the fight hallelujah it
no canned fruit should e'er reside among
our beloved late night meal it
's just not right hallelujah hallelujah

[Chorus]
hal le liescuaha honolu
oha helllujuhu ab ju

[Verse 4]
its called pizza margherita
my amped up loving never we
really meant for this type of coupling never
thought I'd see the day when such a
heinous act would on my plate lay
for peteʼs sake hallelujah forever
