[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something''
is pineapple on pizza your thing
or does it annoy
are you missing that classic taste you

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I despair
for each bite full of pineapple filled with fear
for change
and in every other damn slice

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something kid
are you still using pineapple as lid
or is your searching
ending everywhere you've been to forte

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I despair
at every slice full of pineapple filled
without
or that there'll be pineapple served

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I've had enough of pineapple tonight
I toss away wasted
topple that which I now detests will surely
expel from my plate in has

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
without any pine time end
we're far from the shallow tastes nowen
from the sad mere use of pine
our shared long overdue

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh regretful
ohah taste

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I've had enough of pineapple tonight
I toss away wasted
topple that which I now detests will surely
expel from my plate in has

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
that there needs right till night
we're far from the shallow tastes nowen
of that unfortunate
our hated never in
