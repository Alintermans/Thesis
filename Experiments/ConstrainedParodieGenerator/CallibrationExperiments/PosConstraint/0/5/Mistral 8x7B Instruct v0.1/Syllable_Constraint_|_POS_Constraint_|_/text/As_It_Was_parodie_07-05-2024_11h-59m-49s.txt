[Intro]
hey there larry, we've got a beef,

[Verse 1]
don't you see
pieces of pineapple on
your pizza they just don't belong slices
of pineapple shouldn't be on
people say it
tastes alright but it's just not right
on our beloved pizza
it's time to set things straight tonight now how

[Chorus]
about this world my friend
its been our dining tradition
that pineapple never
meets pizza in the kitchen any
more as it was as it
was can't believe we

[Verse 2]
should even have
tomato sauce combined with
pineapple slices it's against nature
they just don't complement
eachother it
looks like a mess on your pizza
you pity cause you're missing
out on all the other toppings that are so

[Chorus]
about this world my friend
its been our dining tradition
that pineapple never
meets pizza in the kitchen any
more as it was as it
was can't believe we

[Bridge]
load em fast enough take chances ions
I won'ta chat ignore the hateful ions that this
world offers ions load up your pizza
my beloved ions top it off with ions pepper

[Outro]

my ions our beloved pizza
