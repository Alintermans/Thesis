[Verse 1]
I picked up a slice with pineapple there on
the greasy cardboard box felt so wrong somehow
but something said I should give it a try out
and now I can't believe I ever had

[Verse 2]
oh I see you're still eating pineapple pizza e
would you mind if I share this incredulous
mix matching wedded toppings like puzzle pieces
and my stomach turning it's a no from me

[Pre-Chorus]
and its gone our taste bud
the tragic comedowed
and I am throwing more and more saying never
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
for the love of god don't put pineapple
on your pizza it just doesn't belong next to ham at all
thanks bye it's gotta be just
what can I say absolutely

[Verse 3]
reminders pictures on every website I survey
my willpower crumbles looking at slices draped in pineapple like
or they'd say it's gourmet I'd say it's blasphemy sue me ham
my sacred heirloom degraded it's bastardized
and your saying let me try it changes can't be revers
enjoy flavorless thin crust hawaiian heres
and your giving trying while no biteing offending
my sacred righteous to live our be lives my why is
as my willpower weakens and
finding no solution or making even
that ounce of difference in
or maybe my giving too much cred to on my giving
and any its becoming lost hope or my giving

[Pre-Chorus]
or my growing ounce giving
no cred answerin ounce even
or your given in your ounce finally
to having just ounce gave up to

[Chorus]
for the love of god don't put pineapple on
your pizza it just doesn't belong next to ham at all man
that a total I go
my sacred heirloom cannot be
or the ounce remaining forever now ization
