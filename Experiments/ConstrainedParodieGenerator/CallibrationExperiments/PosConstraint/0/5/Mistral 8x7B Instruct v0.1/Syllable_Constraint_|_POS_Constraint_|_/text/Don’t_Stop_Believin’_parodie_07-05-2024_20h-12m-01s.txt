[Verse 1]
just a small town truth 'bout pizza toppings widespread
a slice with pineapple's taste gonna make you
just a pizza fan heatedly opposing and
refusing slices that have pineapple on

[Verse 2]
a saucy discus in a crowd
an abomination among
for all kindsa reasons raising
our shared ire and offendingome

[Pre-Chorus]
criticizer
strolls and peruses the line
they eye the pies with disdainful
manners towards
sweetnesses undesirable
onesome to ever in

[Verse 3]
workdays spent advocating
foodsafe doomed experiment
payment to restaurants' ired the
justly one more

[Verse 4]
these take mighty a stand
these know is out wasting all
oh no debate forever
he is for or as against until

[Pre-Chorus]
criticizer
strolls and peruses the line
they eye the pies with disdainful
manners towards
sweetnesses undesirable
onesome to ever in

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]

lettered upon ire an
expression vis
doeringling everywhere
making
ham customers
get so ize engaged''
letring for out any
time opposers
