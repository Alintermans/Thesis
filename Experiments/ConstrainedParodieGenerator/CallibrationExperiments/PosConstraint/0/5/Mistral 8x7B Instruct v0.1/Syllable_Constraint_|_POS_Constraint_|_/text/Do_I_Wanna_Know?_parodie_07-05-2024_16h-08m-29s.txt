[Verse 1]
have you taken a bite of that
slice with pineapple on it yet tonight at the bar did
you forget that it doesn't belong on
top of your pizza to me it
should be a crime against tastebuds yeah
my hatred for pineapple on pizza I just can
not shake it off my mind says no
but the pizza's still
calling my name should I give in and take a bite or should it
permanently stay off my plate I just can't
