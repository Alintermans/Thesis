[Intro]
is this the final taste tested a purely
grotesque creation no resisting this frankenstein
take a bite are you able to see defeat
I'm just a bold typeface my opinion can
easily be read top to bottom takes a stand easily
any hate spewed forth falls on deafened ears oh pineapple you

[Verse 1]
stop where you stand desec
rated a harmless pasta ring with cannibalism
toppers trespass bringing so
much disdain what were you thinking adding
spare tangy wedges save beloved pizza
from this monstrosity easily removed
stop perverting try as you might nothing rightly matters

[Verse 2]
once sliced ingredients
will never be the same leaving a bad taste behind
bid unfairness adieu go develop
respect offer amped up the flavor and
ditch canned ire acceptability
what absurdity now
your just adding self entitled ire missing

[Guitar Solo]
