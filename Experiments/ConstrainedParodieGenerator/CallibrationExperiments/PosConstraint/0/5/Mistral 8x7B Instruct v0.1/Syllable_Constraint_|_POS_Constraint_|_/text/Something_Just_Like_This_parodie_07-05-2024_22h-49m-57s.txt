[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I picked up some pizza to
an addition to the
box of flavors I knew
ham or pepperoni
found a pineapple
thought it'd be a win
but when I take a bite I know it shouldn't be in

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said dough do you wanna
more delicious your wants
it's not asking for perfection
with no controversial cont
some unique options
this new excitement
not something I hate eating
callin'it my beloved
want something different than

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something sav
something besides che
something minestrone ain
oh we must battle thus against
oh I want something sav
something others law
look right boulder thinza
oh we must battle finally
oh I want something away

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
my beloved delivered was
the pizza and those gre
the ham my expected
but pineapple and me
will never get along
this recipe without
and my taste buds strongly admonishes in

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said come on where is love
why such your hasteful
I appreciate so trying
though that particular one
a loss worthy cont
each separate piece
not flavorings my beloved
puts my wants increasing

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
what could life really like this
what must time actually

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh our must options always
changes ingredients
something savers life
think fruitfulness belongs
in fruit bowls only then inside
oneself decisions lies
c hoes decision
think fruitlessness belongs

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
so question answered
nevertheless final
my respected always agree
without this controversial
some heroes choices
every great choice
not everyone their approved
puts my decided fixed
what can heart easily like

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh it want something exactly
oh it want something certainly
oh it want something exactly
