[Verse 1]
stash away those pineapples
don't you dare defile the pie
your taste buds fooled by sweet deceit oh no
it's just not right for pizza pie

[Pre-Chorus]
hold firm do not give in low low
hold fearless do not give in low
protectants of pizza sacred
oh no here comes the pine

[Chorus]
in the light for all involved clearly
just say no to pineapple on
its taste impossible to clear
oh no here comes the pineapple
a sinful topping ruining
a bite I adulations des

[Post-Chorus]
yeah ok

[Verse 2]
its taste offensive with its
sweet cloying aftermath cur
I'll stick with pepperoni beloved
or maybe vegetarian

[Pre-Chorus]
hold firm do not give in low low
hold fearless do not give in low
protectants of pizza sacred
oh no here comes the pine

[Chorus]
in the light for all involved clearly
just say no to pineapple on
its taste impossible to clear
oh no here comes the pineapple
a sinful topping ruining
a bite I adulations des

[Post-Chorus]
yeah ok

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
but who designed when silly they
decided pineapple was fine
it turns my stomach its supposed
pizza not a tropical pine

[Pre-Chorus]
hold firm do not give in low low
hold fearless do not give in low
protectants of pizza sacred
oh no here comes the pine

[Chorus]
in the light for all involved clearly
just say no to pineapple on
its taste impossible to clear
oh no here comes the pineapple
a sinful topping ruining
a bite I adulations des

[Outro]
a sinning that tis outrage e
a flavoring that illicit
no serving this monstrosity
a ruling all must resolute
no one answers
