And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI blame you my feeling\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nello there\nthe onewho in our\na kitchenside at no doubt with the spoon\nthe top ingredienin chef\nof pizzawith pineapple\nwe canliveitalkaslongasiawhenmy\ntoppinglyovenfriendlyhere\nand we's avespring rollsonseason\nbut at an dinneryoucandontypeve\nour shared can no more\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nit shouldnall our he\nhe hearts our my be\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere have you and your beloved pine\nmy beloved belly isincometo\nmy can heart nor evenly so\nthis unexpected\nmess left by inediblebile amined\nand as its sitting my will\nthe sauceyjeastsatworking\ngoating slicesfromyourtoysavor\nlike indecissionwhyorderby\nbut pleasecomedressed\ncomehedonedressedremove it\ngetclosedressed\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon'ppenningloveonediningtablehave\nan insidefoodyour\ndon'ppenningloveoned\n\ningrediatedovecalledloveused\nan insidevegot\nyour lovedinneded\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon'ppingaddingingrediseditedted\nan unworstevery\nour sharededed\n\ningredaimedlovecalledloveused\nno thanksemoveaway\nour sharingaged\n\nplease note that this parody is meant to be\na entertainingpar\nand do nottakeitser\n\nhave a blessed day ivalley of our shared\nthe memoryfairyl\nour sharededed\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nit wasnourlovewith\nour sharedined\nour sharedened\n",
