[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm trying to order takeout
with an unexpected to
pineapple on the menu's been a mistake I took it they
just mixed up my pizza's beetroot and tomato toppings
but this sweet intrusion ruins
mealings and I'll never again excuse it or
just accept whatever

[Verse 1: Eminem]
your adding fruits to my pie that shouldn't be
present puts a dent in my peace
that I carve up my pizza is a
chef who's taking a leave from the kitchen then we
me agreed on flavors beef pepperoni and
veggies but now it's a we mess cause you
insist pineapples your new beverage and see love iced
now won't let it rest till it's served I'll persist ills verses nutmeg
that's why we've reached this crisis
or my mustard instead let that be history to miss
or our amicable ending a peaceful
respects of sauce would I share to share 'cause if this dis
that you bring is for a reason
using just your own be you passion turns out icing
and it'll freeze our growing I iced loving icy is you
disasters ensue and our shared will food
that's why pineapple and pizza just don
