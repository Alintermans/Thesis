[Chorus]
why pineapple on a
pizza should never be just
bad idea comes to my mind
it's icky and sweet so

[Verse 1]
can't you see it doesn't belong on top of che
a pie that's savory and
to be enjoyed meaty and
satisfying its supposed
to be my favorite treat mom
but pineapple ruins the whole
moment it just perplexes
my taste buds how could you upend perfectly good
expectations with a fruit that's just too
sweet and out of place like a unicorn at a funeral makes me
uncomfortable my dear
let's keep our pizza trad
its here come never mixed that its gone it best bad wrong
just like your away kissing don

[Chorus]
why pineapple on a pizza should never be
our sacred tradition of toppings upheld since
anticipational my wants met we good happy our is
me enjoy your will very

[Verse 2]
your icy stare so calculated
I can't help but feel frustrated
your icy stare so calculatedly cold
like your icy stare so calculated
your calculated icy
its makes more icy icy they
out my will icy will icy
my icy my will icy

[Verse 3]
or your icy icy icy icy icy icy
why does something delight ical icy
of icy icy icy icy icy you
or icy icy icy icy icy
icy icy icy icy icy
icy icy so icy icy
icy so icy icy icy icy icy icy
icy my icy icy icy icy icy

[Outro]
