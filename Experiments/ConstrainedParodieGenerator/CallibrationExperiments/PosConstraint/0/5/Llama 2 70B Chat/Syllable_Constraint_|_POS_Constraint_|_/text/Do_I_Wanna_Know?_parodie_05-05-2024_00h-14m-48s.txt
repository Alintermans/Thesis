[Verse 1]
have you come to realize it just
doesn't feel the same when pineapple's on the pizza all
the flavors overpower and texture
aint no no combinations that
goes it's ruining the taste can't you
understand take a bite and you'll see it's just not right
why honestly ruin a good
pizza with some fruit
an amalgamation our taste buds can't compute a
perfect dish no pineapple please its just not worth

[Pre-Chorus]
do our taste buds have to suffer oh so bad
aint no way pineapple belongs on a pizza that
if you a had aslice youd dump it pretty fast
as lies pineapples spot in the culinary world
