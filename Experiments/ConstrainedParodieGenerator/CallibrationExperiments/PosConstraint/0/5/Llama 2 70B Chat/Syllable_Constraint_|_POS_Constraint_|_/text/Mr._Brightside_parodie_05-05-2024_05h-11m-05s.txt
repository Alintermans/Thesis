[Verse]
people out there like to put pineapple on their pied
I ask myself how did it end up being so
it showed off as a friendly fruit used in making smoothies
its supposed to be healthy but adding it to
pizza is making me sick thinking about it
at our can family's pizza party and
now my extended is calling to question and
and my will no longer

[Pre-Chorus]
but my will no longer her
my extended because
making me
and my just gave too will my will order
and giving control

[Chorus]
confusion turns great decision into
question to whether good times
stop to inquire who people
but its just apart of life
life is decision calling
make up my independent
on our loved fresh

[Guitar Solo]
