[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple on a pizza's just a curse
I'm fired up and tired of
the way it ruins every
pizza pie under the moonlight

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you judge me for my taste preference we
hold the line against the
pineapple intrusion on our
pepperoni paradise with

[Pre-Chorus]
our beloved dish since childhood
piling up the toppings in the hood
standing firm for tradition and
flavor combinations grander than ever planned it
knowing deep within our hearts
pineapple just doesn't belong
singing out against the wrongs of
adding fruit to our pizza

[Chorus]
painstaking process made us belie
vers in flavor purists
painstaking process made us belie
vers in flavor purists
painstaking process made us believers of
our love for savory pies it
painstaking process made us belie
vers in flavor purists

[Verse 3]
third things third
take a stand against the pineapple
spread the word across the
landscapes of our pizzerias to
preserve our culinary

[Pre-Chorus]
heritage passed down through the
generations of pizza che
fs battling against the tide
finding ourselves divided
but we'll remain steadfast and true to our beliefs
keeping the flame of our passion alive and renewed it
renewed it like

[Chorus]
painstaking process made us belie
vers in flavor purists
painstaking process made us belie
vers in flavor purists
painstaking process made us believers of
our love for savory pies it
painstaking process made us belie
vers in flavor purists

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the power of the cheese and the sauce
you're the champion of the
traditional pizza cause
united we stand against

[Pre-Chorus]
the invasion of the pineapple reigning supreme
finding solace in our unity and our teamwork
we continue

[Chorus]
painstaking process made us belie
vers in flavor purists
painstaking process made us belie

painstaking process made us believers of
our love for savory pies it
painstaking process made us belie
