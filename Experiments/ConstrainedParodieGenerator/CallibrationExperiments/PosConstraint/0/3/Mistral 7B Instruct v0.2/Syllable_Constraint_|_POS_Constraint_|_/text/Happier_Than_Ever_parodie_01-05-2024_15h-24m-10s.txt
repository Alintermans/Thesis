[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our culinary scene
I'm tastier than ever been
wish I could make it clear

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to ponder something sincere
to write myself a letter
to tell myself what to fear
do you read my recipes
or ignore my savory cre
when you said it was trending new
was I even on your plate
I knew when I added you to mine I'd ruin
the harmony of flavors I was build
I wish I had foreseen that you'd spoil it all with pineapple in the
filling or the topping or
the sauce instead of being
the olive in my caprese salad or the cherry
on top of my sundae delight

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our plate we're tastiest
happier than ever been with every bite we
wish we could explain it clearer it's just not right with pineapple
on our pizza pie oh

[Verse 2]
you call yourself a foodie in your
kitchenaid's apron so fine slicing
but you scared me to death with your pineapple
on my pepperoni or ham and pine
I don't associate
I don't associate with
this culinary disaster
you made me hate this table

[Verse 3]
and I don't spread rumors about you on the foodie
forums never told anyone bad things
'cause that's just embarrassing we were once a perfect
pairing but now it's just making me feel sad
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad
I could tell you about every time that you ruined a
dish with your pineapple addition but I'd have an
empty plate because you never listened to my advice
never paid any mind to my palate or

[Outro]
you ruined every sav
ory dish I loved believed you were
misunderstood but made all
my moments your own just pineapple off
ple
ase leave
me
alone
yes pine
