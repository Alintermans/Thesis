[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pirate seeking a
been a jester spreading a
been a lover of pineapple on a pizza's fate under
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is dis
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
it's round and spiky from the top to the base
toppings galore but oh what a
from anchovies to bacon creates
but she just hates the sight of this pineapple taste
it's a culinary clash she's on a mission
she's kept track of every pizza sin
and guess who just happens to be ordering it again
actually just covered in pineapple and she has what my pal
because she loves tradition
and you don't put pineapple on no one's pizza pie
but she's devised some plan to change the recipe
knife in hand says our relationship's hanging by a
so she's been on the internet
says maybe she'll be my pepperoni princess to
and I know she's using me to try to play him I don't care
hi pinacolada but I shoulda said
after the first slice but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pirate seeking a
been a jester spreading a
been a lover of pineapple on a pizza's fate under
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is dis
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
one slice turned to two turned to three nights in
he found out now she feels disrespected and used
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the
so I revert to the studio like a hole in
I just feel like the person I'm turning into's irrede
covered in pineapple I prayed on you like it's a religious duty
and now that I got you I don't want you near me anymore ve
took advantage in my craving for more
why do I do this thing that I do ruining the
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech detergent
'cause now with her in the oven we can't bring
her into this world shoulda known to use
protection before I bit into
your forbidden fruit pineapple pineapple pine
pineapple pineapple pineapple pine
pineapple pineapple
pineapple pineapple pineapple pine pine
pineapple pineapple pineapple pine pine pineapple pine
dam

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pirate seeking a
been a jester spreading a
been a lover of pineapple on a pizza's fate under
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is dis
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pineapplemy
river
pin
river run
call me pineapple pine
river pineapple we'll let the pine

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the side dish never the main course
pineapple if life was a pizza pie
and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in five ways
speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice maybe
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
but I made you deliver my baby
this love triangle left us in a disaster
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pirate seeking a
been a jester spreading a
been a lover of pineapple on a pizza's fate under
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
the truth and my lies now are fall
so let the river run pineapple pineapple
pineapple pineapple
