[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading labels on
the foods that we consume
pepperoni and ham
pineapple and its juice
vegetarian
vegan or gluten free
but I'm not the type who'd put pineapple on the tree

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said eat what you love and
take risks with every
meal I'm not looking for something
that's trendy and gritty or
exotic or fru
ity just something
I can turn to comforting
somebody I can trust
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo du du doo du du
doo du du doo du
doo du du doo du du
oh I want something just like this
doo du du doo du du
doo du du doo du
doo du du doo du du
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading labels on
the foods that we consume
anchovies and olives
jalape√±os and che
ese but I'm not the type
who'd ruin my pizza
with pineapple on it's a tragedy oh

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said eat what you love and take
risks with every meal
I'm not looking for something bland
or predictable or sweet
just something I can
turn to savory
somebody I can miss de
arly I want something

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo du du doo du du
doo du du doo du
doo du du doo du du
oh I want something just like this
doo du du doo du du
doo du du doo du
doo du du doo du du

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for something weird
or exotic or fruity
just something I can
turn to comforting
somebody I can kiss de
arly I want something
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
