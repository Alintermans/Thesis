[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pinefor you ire

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the anomaly on your
pizza pie with pineapple zest in the
background of the kitchen floor
the unwitting victim of
your pizza's inedible horror story
we can live like cheese and tom
where you can always find me near the
oven's warmth and promise of a better
tomorrow without this

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pinefor you ire
I pinefor you ire

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where are you and I'm so sorry
I can't eat my dinner now tonight
I need someone and always more
this unusual
pineapple flavor comes creeping on each bite
and as I contemplate it
the texture from the pineap
clings to the roof of my mouth feeling
like indigestion and regret
and as I ponder whether
to call you and hear your voice of defense
will you come over

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the mystery inside
my head I pinefor
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the mystery inside
my head I pinefor

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the mystery inside
my head I pinefor
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the mystery inside
my head I pinefor
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the mystery inside
my head I pinefor
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the mystery inside
my head I pinefor

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pinefor you ire
I pinefor you ire
I pinefor you ire
I pinefor you ire
