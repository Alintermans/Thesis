[Verse 1]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
pineapple on a pizza
welcome to this culinary
mystery you're trying to solve ya'll gonna see
we can't bribe our taste
it's an endless debate true

[Pre-Chorus]
we never agree we've been here though
why are we always stuck on this topic
the arguments no end
we never agree we've been here though
why are we always stuck on this topic
the arguments no end

[Chorus]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
pineapple on a pizza night
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this debate
just stop your arguing it'll
be alright they say we gotta

[Verse 2]
just stop your arguing have the flavor of
your life enjoy the surprise
pineapple on a pizza
remember it's all good tonight we can
agree to disagree and
find common ground somewhere far

[Pre-Chorus]
we never agree we've been here though
why are we always stuck on this topic
the arguments no end
we never agree we've been here though
why are we always stuck on this topic
the arguments no end

[Chorus]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
pineapple on a pizza night

[Pre-Chorus]
we never agree we've been here though
why are we always stuck on this topic
the arguments no end
we never agree we've been here though
why are we always stuck on this topic
the arguments no end

[Bridge]

before it gets too bland

[Outro]
stop your arguing baby it's a sign of the
pineapple on a pie
we gotta get away we gotta get away

we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
