[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that hawaii cooked and it caused a
disagreeable surprise for ya it goes like
this pineapple first then cheese and
tomatoes next the slippery
slide of flavors none can resist the hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 2]
your palate was strong but you needed
proof pineapple on a pizza
it seemed so wrong but then it stole ya senses
they twisted your taste buds into
a tangled mess and from your lips they
drew the hallelujah pineapple pie ded

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 3]
you say I took the trend in vain
I don't even know the name
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a fusion of tastes in every
slice it doesn't matter which you
tried the sweet or the savory pineapple

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I tried to touch
I've spoken the truth I didn't come to fool
ya and even though it all went
wrong I'll stand before the pizza
god with nothing on my tongue but halleluj

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Outro]
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this table I've sat this
floor I used to eat alone before I knew
you and I've seen your pineapple flag on
the pepperoni arch love is
not a victory march it's a cold and it's a

[Additional Lyrics]
broken hallelujah pineap
ple pie there was a time you let
me know what's really going on below but
now you never show it to me do
you and remember when I moved
in you the holy pineapple was moving too

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outpined
you and it's not a cry that you hear at
night it's not somebody who's seen the
light it's a cold and it's a broken halleluj
