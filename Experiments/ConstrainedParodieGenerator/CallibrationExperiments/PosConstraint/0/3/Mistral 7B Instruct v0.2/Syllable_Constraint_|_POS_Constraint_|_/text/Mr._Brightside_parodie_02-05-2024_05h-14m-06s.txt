[Verse]
comin' out of my kitchen and I've been doin' just
gotta hide in the corner because pineapple
started out on the piecrustbut ended up on the dish
it was only a topping it was only a
now I'm changin' the channel and he's orderin
havin' a slice and she's makin' a face so grim
now they're enjoyin' their meal and my appetite's
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but he's savourin' each bite
she takes off her knife now
let me be
'cause I just can't look it's ruining the
and takin' control

[Chorus]
pineapplesity turnin' savory
swimmin' through sick sweet stories
chokin' on your excuses
but it's just the price I pay
pizza's destiny callin
open up my hungry eyes
'cause I'm mr veget

[Guitar Solo]
