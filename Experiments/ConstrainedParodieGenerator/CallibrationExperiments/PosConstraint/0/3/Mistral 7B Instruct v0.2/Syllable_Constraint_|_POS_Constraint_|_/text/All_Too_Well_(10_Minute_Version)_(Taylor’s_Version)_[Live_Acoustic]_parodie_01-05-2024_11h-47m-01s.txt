[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it wasn't quite the same
a pineapple slice on top of my pizza
ruined the taste and left me feeling rather

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple on a pizza pie is such a shame
we can't agree on this culinary
palette clash creating quite the strain within the
flavor harmony of our perfect dish

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's just a food
but my taste buds are in a
pineapple rut and I'm not fine at all indeed
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again at the pizza parlor
you almost choked on your slice because you were laughing at me
tomato sauce in my hair
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pepperoni pizza on the countertop we used to
grin and share a slice or two but now it's just a sour memory
and you're telling tales about the time before the pineapple
when our palates danced in harmony and our
appetites were satisfied with just the cheese and sauce alone
anchovies too if that was our delightful
combination but now it's all spoiled by a single
ingredient ruining the harmony of our
meal and our memories of
pure pizza bliss and joy forevermore gone
with a slice of pineapple
check the taste and come back swearing it's the same old pie but
all I feel is disappointment and a longing for

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's just a food
but my taste buds are in a pine
apple rut and I'm not fine at allinde
ed indeed oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again at the pizza parlortable
you almost choked on your slice because you were laughing at me
tomato sauce in the
air I remember it all too
well tomato sauce in the air I remember it
all too well pepperoni pepperoni pepperon
I remember it all
tomato sauce in the air I was

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this culinary master
piece was ruined with
one simple addition
pineapple on a pizza pie
running scared I was there I remember it all too well pine
apple on a pizza pie running scared I was there I was
there tomato sauce in the air I remember
it all too well tomato sauce

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time I bite into a slice
you said if we had agreed on toppings maybe it would have been fine
but that made me want to scream
the idea you had of me who was she
a never picky pizza lover whose preferences reflected on
you not covered in tomato sauce
but now you serve me pineapple slices
and I can't get
rid of it I remember it all too well
yes I remember it all too well tomato
sauce in the air I was there I remember it all too well tom
ato sauce in the air I was there I was there tomate

[Verse 5]
time won't fly I'm paralyzed by it waiting
for the day when I can be my old self again and find the pizza
that I used to love before you added pineapple
but now you keep my old pepperoni pies and
I walk home alone with memories of the past
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week it
reminds you of innocence
and it smells like pizza and me yes

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you added pineapple to my pizza
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
tomato sauce in the air
you remember it all
tomato sauce in the
air I was there I was
there tomato sauce in
the air I was there I was there

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapple stays the
same age I'm a pizza connoisseur who
is returning half my weight in frustration
and did the pineapple love affair
maim you too or was it just me alone in this
city's pizza parlor cold
I still remember the first slice of snow
and how it melted as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
just between us did the pineapple love affair maim you
all too well just between us do you remember it
all too well just between us I remember it all too well tom
ato sauce in the air I was there we
were there tomato sauce in the air
I remember it all too well tom
ato sauce in the air I was there I was
there tomato sauce in the air I was
there tomato sauce in the air we
remember it all too well tom a
to sauce in the air we were there
tomato sauce in the air I was there
tomato sauce in the air I was
there tomato sauce in the air we
remember it all too well tom
ato sauce in the air we were there tom
ato sauce in the air I was there
tomato sauce in the air we were
there tomato sauce in the air we were there

[Spoken Outro]
