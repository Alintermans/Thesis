[Verse 1]
just a small town slicefar from a pineapple
a classic pie with cheese and pepperoni
there's no room for fruit on a savory dishlike
a fish on a bike or a coat in the sun

[Verse 2]
a chef in a steamy kitchen
the scent of dough and marinade
for a bite they gladly share the
meal that's passed down through the ages on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
lining every street and
their hunger searching in the night
pizza ovens
baking to perfection to feed
cravings hiding in the night

[Verse 3]
kneading dough and adding to
ppings tried and true everyone
craves a taste of this delightful dish
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some may try the sweet and
savory sin but they'll soon
regret it when they take a
bite and realize it's just not right oh

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
lining every street and
their hunger searching in the night
pizza ovens
baking to perfection to feed
cravings hiding in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
in the classic pizza
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
