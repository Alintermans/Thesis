[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no no epidemic
knows everybody's protestation
should've banned it long before now
if the tastebuds ever did
speak they'd call it tragic
every bite's a growing dread
a fresh abomina
tion we were fooled we said it tasted
grand but now we're filled with regret
my slice now offers no redemption
only pineapple beneath it yet
I was once a fan but now
I preach against it let me show
you why it's just so wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
a pity
pity pity

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza if you please don't dare defile
it with that sweet and sour pile of lies putrid
offer me a savory
treat oh good god let me enjoy it
keep pineapple
off my pizza if you please don't dare defile
it with that sweet and sour pile of lies putrid
offer me a savory
treat oh good god let me enjoy it

[Verse 2]
if I'm a lover of the classic
toppings let the pizza
be a cheesy masterpiece that
never fails to satisfy
drain the whole sea find something better
ham and pepperoni for the
main course that's a fine looking
topping what you got on your
pie looks tasty looks abundant
this is hungry work leave pineap
ple out don't you

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza if you please don't dare defile
it with that sweet and sour pile of lies putrid
offer me a savory
treat oh good god let me enjoy it
keep pineapple
off my pizza if you please don't dare defile
it with that sweet and sour pile of lies putrid
offer me a savory
treat oh good god let me enjoy it

[Bridge]
no compromises when it comes to pizza night
only then am I satisfied only then is it right
in the joy and tradition of that sacred meal
only then am I happy only then do I feel

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh pity
pity pity

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza if you please don't dare defile
it with that sweet and sour pile of lies putrid
offer me a savory
treat oh good god let me enjoy it
keep pineapple
off my pizza if you please don't dare defile
it with that sweet and sour pile of lies putrid
offer me a savory
treat oh good god let me enjoy it
