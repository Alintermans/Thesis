[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the trends
pineapple on pizza
it's a debate that desc
ends into a mess
of heated arguments
but I don't see the reason for this abomin

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they askwhere d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some controversial mix
some monstrosity
no longer exists
just give me something simple
something I can dismiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doodoodoodoodoodo
doodoodoodoodoo
doodoodoodoodoodo
oh I want something just like this
doodoodoodoodoodo
doodoodoodoodoo
doodoodoodoodoodo
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the trends
pineapple on pizza
is a sin that descends
into a messy plate
of conflicting tastes and
but I'm not the kind of person that it sat

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she askedwhere d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some experimental
mix of sweet and sav
just give me something
that I can understand and
devour in a twist

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doodoodoodoodoodo
doodoodoodoodoo
doodoodoodoodoodo
oh I want something just like this
doodoodoodoodoodo
doodoodoodoodoo
doodoodoodoodoodo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some controversial mix
some monstrosity
no longer exists
just give me something simple
something I can dismiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
