[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to forget that sin
of putting pineapple on pizza
you agree there's no way to
forgive that

[Verse]
I've tasted two disasters for
my taste buds' delight I can't ignore it any more
oh gosh it's gross the taste I abhor
if I could turn back time I would not explore
the idea of pineapple
on pizza as an option to adorn a slice of dough
it's a travesty so throw it away
and I don't wanna taste it again so in the trash it
goes I've tasted two disasters
my taste buds' delight I can't ignore it any more
oh gosh it's gross the taste I abhor
if I could turn back time I would not explore
the idea of pineapple
on pizza as an option to adorn a slice of dough
it's a travesty so throw it away
and I don't wanna taste it again so in the trash it

[Chorus]
in the trash it goes
in the trash it goes
in the trash it goes goes goes
in the trash it goes
in the trash it goes goes goes
in the trash it goes

[Outro]
in the trash it goes
it goes it goes it goes
is my disgust your joy
is all of my disgust your joy
enjoy
