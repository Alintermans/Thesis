[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something' bout
that slice of pizza with pineapple
on top or not izz
it still a tasty dish you gotza

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm revol
in every bite I'm cravin' for revul
sion taste
and in the aftermath fearin' ind

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something son
are you done playin' with that pineapple
on your pizza slice
isn't it much better with mozzarell

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm revol
in every bite I'm cravin' for revul
sion taste
and in the aftermath fearin' ind

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I refuse
to take a bite of that
pizza slice with pineapple on toppa let
it float away like a bad

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pina colada
in the sha la la la low let it
float away we're far from the
pizza with pineapple now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ah ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I refuse
to take a bite of that
pizza slice with pineapple on toppa let
it float away like a bad

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pina colad
in the sha la la la low let it
float away we're far from
the pizza with pineapple
