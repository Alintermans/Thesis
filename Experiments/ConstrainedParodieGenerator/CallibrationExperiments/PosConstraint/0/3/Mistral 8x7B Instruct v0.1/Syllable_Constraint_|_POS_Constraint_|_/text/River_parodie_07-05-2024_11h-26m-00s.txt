[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
been a hater of the taste combined with mine offendin'ly
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my stance now are falling like the rain down
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his slice attacked oh no
thinks pineapple's on a pizza
belongs in tacos to his dismay
sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched anyway and
on his breath's jack he's a snack addict after all
it's a fact that pineapple's a no go
but he just can't resist the sweet and the savory
so here we go he's got pineapple on his pizza you see he can
never get enough of that
and she just wants to exact revenge and get back at him
it's a chess match she's on his back like a jetpack
she's kept track of all his pizza habits and guess who just
happens to be ordering a
pepperoni now actually just shit on that
after pineapple who needs it am I right say no more my friend
hi suzanne but I shoulda said bye suzanne
after the first bite but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
been a hater of the taste combined with mine offendin'ly
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my stance now are falling like the rain down
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand yeah
it was come sunrise scram now we hug tight and oh
he found out now she feels deserted and used
he left so what he did it first to her too
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and sue
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners none
have to be reserved in a booth I just
feel like the person who I'm turning into's irrede
emable I preyed on you like it's church at the pew and now that
I got you I don't want you took advant
age In my thirst to pursue why do I
do this dirt that I do got no clue
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burning the wound
cause now with her in the
womb we can't bring her in this world shoulda
known to use protection before I bit into your poison
ap

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
been a hater of the taste combined with mine offendin'ly
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my stance now are falling like the rain down
so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's river my name
is ri
ver
river run
call me river we'll let
the river run listen to the words

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if life was a highway
and deceit was an enclave I would be swerving in five
lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice may
be that's why I may have came at you side
ways I can't keep my lies
straight but I made you terminate my pie
this love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
been a hater of the taste combined with mine offendin'ly
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
I fucked up
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my stance now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
