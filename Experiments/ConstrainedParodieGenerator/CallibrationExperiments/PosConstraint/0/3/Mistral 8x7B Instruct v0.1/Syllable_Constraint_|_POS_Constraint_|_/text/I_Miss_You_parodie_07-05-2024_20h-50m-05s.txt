[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I frown upon it whole

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the fruit that doesn't belong
on pizza we all know it's a sinful
abomination on a
cheesy slice of heavenly
crust it shouldn't be allowed here on this earth
it's an insult to our
beloved pizza pies we hold so dear
and in the night we'll wish this never spread
we'll wish this never spread

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I frown upon it whole
I frown upon it whole

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where did you come from and how did
you invade our sacred dish tonight
I don't need you and always
this gross sensation
comes creeping on so haunting every time
and as I stare I counted
the pineapple chunks on top
disgusting evidence of a crime
against humanity and taste
a culinary treason
will you leave my pizza alone tonight
leave my pizzaalone

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add yourself to me you're already
the abomination
I frown upon it whole
don't add yourself to me you're already
the abomination
I frown upon it whole

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add yourself to me you're already
the abomination
I frown upon it whole
don't add yourself to me you're already
the abomination
I frown upon it whole
don't add yourself to me you're already
the abomination
I frown upon it whole
don't add yourself to me you're already
the abomination
I frown upon it whole

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I frown upon it whole
I frown upon it whole
I frown upon it whole
I frown upon it whole
