[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottles in hand looking so divine start
it started out with a slice now my stomach is in a
wad can't believe it pineapple on pizza
now I'm full of regret and my tastebuds are
offended it's all in my head and my heart is
broken why did I put pineapple on pizza
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're eating it now it
looks disgusting I can
let it go
cause I just can't look it's ruining
my mealtime holy

[Chorus]
jealousy of those who never tried it
swimming in regret I can
no longer deny it but
it's just the price I pay for
trying something new open
up my disappointed eyes
cause I'm mr no

[Guitar Solo]
