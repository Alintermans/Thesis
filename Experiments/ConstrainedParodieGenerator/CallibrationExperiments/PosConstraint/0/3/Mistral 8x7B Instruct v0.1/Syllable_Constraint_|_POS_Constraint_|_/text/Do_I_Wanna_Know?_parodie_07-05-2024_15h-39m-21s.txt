[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple on your
slice a turnoff that just can't slide off your tongue quite right
does it clash with ham like red and green on
purpleunderstand that it's a sin
have you tried alternatives like bacon
or sausage instead of that sweet tropical intrud
on your savory dish will you
ever change your mind
or will you stick to your ways and leave pineapple behindprel
choruscrawlin' back to rejecting pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want it known that I despise pineapple
hopin' that you'll see the error of your tastebud
baby we both know that a pizza is better
without pineapple in the way of true enjoyment

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to you
ever thought of excluding
pineapple from
your slice tonight
maybe I'm too
busy enjoying
my pizza without pineap
please reconsider
crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
so do you have the nerve
to put pineapple on a pizza and
claim it's the best thing since herb and garlic sauce
simmer down and realize that pineapple on pizza is
just plain wrong and it's time to move on and find a new topping
but we could be together if you wanted tochange
your ways and try something new like mushrooms or on

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want it known that I despise pineapple
hopin' that you'll see the error of your tastebud
baby we both know that a pizza is better
without pineapple in the way of true enjoyment

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to you today to ask you
to give up pineapple and
try something new tonightmaybe
I'm too busy enjoying my meal
without the distraction of pineapple
to consider anything else
crawlin' back to you tonight
again I ask you
to reconsider

[Outro]
do I want it known that I despise pineapple
hopin' that you'll see the error of your tastebud
baby we both know that a pizza is better
without pineapple in the way of true enjoyment
do I want it known that I despise pineapple oh
do I want it known that I despise pineapple oh
do I want it known that I despise pineapple oh no
