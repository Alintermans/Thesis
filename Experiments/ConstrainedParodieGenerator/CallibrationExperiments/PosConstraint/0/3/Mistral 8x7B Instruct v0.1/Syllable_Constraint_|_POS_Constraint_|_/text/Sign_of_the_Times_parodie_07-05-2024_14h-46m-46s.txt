[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a culinary crime
don't you think it's gross inside
you can't mask the taste with extra cheesemy
it looks quite absurd on top
but it ain't really good

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted better things before now
why add fruit to something we adore now
the oddity the odd
we've tasted better things before now
why add fruit to something we adore now
the oddity the odd

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta change this recipe
we gotta change this recipe
put down that pineapple slice and hear me
they say it's time for something new
we gotta change this recipe

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
let's stick with classic toppings
pepperoni or mushrooms
remember how delicious it can be
we can try again somewhere
somewhere far away from pine

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted better things before now
why add fruit to something we adore now
the oddity the odd
we've tasted better things before now
why add fruit to something we adore now
the oddity the odd

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta change this recipe
we gotta change this recipe
stop adding pineapple slice and hear my ple
they say it's time for something new
we gotta change this recipe

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted better things before now
why add fruit to something we adore now
the oddity the odd
we've tasted better things before now
why add fruit to something we adore now
the oddity the odd

[Bridge]
we should reconsider
our pizza make
before it's all too late
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my pleaxpress
we gotta get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
