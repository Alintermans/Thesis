[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
my taste buds scream in horror
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just should not be

[Verse 1]
let me ponder on this notion and write it in a
letter to myself to read
what's the right thing to do with
ham and pineapple pizza
do you see my disappointment
or do you turn away from it
when you said you'd try it once
were you even on my side then now I see it
should have stuck to my conviction and not
given in to this monstrosity at hand I knew it was a bad
idea to ask you to
put pineapple on our
favorite savory treat and now it's hard to eat
how can I express my dismay

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I'm in despair
wish I could explain it clearer but it just should not
be there mmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmm
I wish it wasn't true e

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask me to share
a slice of your latest creation
but I decline with disdain and tell you it
tastes like sacrilege and desperation
I do not relate to you
I do not relate to you no
how could you do this to our
once beloved meal and ruin

[Verse 3]
and I don't rant on social media about this
abomination never told a soul
that you'd committed this culinary sin so
shame on you for doing this to our meal
so don't insist that it's divine and
don't belittle my opinion
I could list all the reasons why it's wrong but I'd run out of
words and be left with an empty plate because it just
doesn't belong there never paid any mind to my taste
buds or my culture so I shut it all out

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
always said you were misunderstood
made all my favorite meals
just disgusting now leave me alone yeah
ah
goddam
ah
goddam
ahfuck
