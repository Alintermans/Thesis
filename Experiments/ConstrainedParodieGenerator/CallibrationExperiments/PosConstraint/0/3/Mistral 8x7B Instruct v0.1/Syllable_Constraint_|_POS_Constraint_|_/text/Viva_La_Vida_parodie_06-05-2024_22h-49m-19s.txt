[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love my pie
topped with cheese up in the sky now
in the morning I take a slice too
discovering pineapple

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to savor each
bite of pepperonI's rich speech now
taste of pineapple brings a
frown upon my face and sighs so profound
one taste and I held my peace
next the taste became a beast
and I found that my cravings stand dissolved
on a pizza pineapple's resolve atroc

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear church bells ringin' clearin' minds of
pineapple residue behinds com
be my judge and execution
my defenders in this culinary
for some reason I can't explain
once you tasted pineapple
there was never any
honesty in taste again and

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a bitter and twisted
flavor on my tongue that twisted
shattered taste buds and the sound of scream
people couldn't comprehend my plea to
revolutionize our
pizza toppings without pineap
just a travesty on a lonely dish aw
who would ever wanna eat a king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear church bells ringin' clearin' minds of
pineapple residue behinds com
be my judge and execution
my defenders in this culinary
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't allow me
never an honest word
but that was when I loved pizza

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]

[Outro]
