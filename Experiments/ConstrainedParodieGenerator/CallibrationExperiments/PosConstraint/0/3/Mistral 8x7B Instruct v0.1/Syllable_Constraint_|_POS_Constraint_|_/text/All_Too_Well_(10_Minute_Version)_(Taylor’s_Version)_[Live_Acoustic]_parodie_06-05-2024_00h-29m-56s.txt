[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I spit it out in the trash with disgust
you just laughed and said it's all in my head now

[Verse 2]
oh my god that taste it's sacrilege and a sinning
this sweet and savory mix just makes me want
to hurl it out of my mouth right at this minute
but you seem to enjoy it without a care

[Pre-Chorus]
and I wish I could forget
the taste of pineapple on
my pizza but it's seared in my mind now despite
my efforts

[Chorus]
because there it is again that slimy fruit
on my pizza slice it just doesn't compute wichita lin
e man it's not meant to be
on a pizza it just doesn't

[Verse 3]
photo of pineapple on a pizza slice staring back
at me it's a monstrosity I can't comprehend the thought of
it on my pizza It's a crime against humanity I
just can't fathom why anyone would do it to
themselves it's a disgrace to the pizza world a tragedy
unfolding before my very eyes and I just
can't look away as I take another bite of
my pizza without the pineapple it's a small comfort
in this world full of chaos and
mayhem at least my pizza is pineapple
free and I'm grateful for that
and I'll remember it all too well as I savor each
bite of my pizza and cherish the memories of

[Pre-Chorus]
a pineapple free pizza
and the joy it brings me knowing
that it will never be tainted by the
abomination that is pine

[Chorus]
on a pizza it's just not right no matter how
you slice it it's a mistake that can't be undone but at

ever as I take each
bite of my pizza and savor the

[Bridge]
the thought of pineapple on a pizza
makes me shudder with disgust
and I'll never understand why people
insist on putting
it on their pizza it
just doesn't make any sense to
me but at least I can remember my pizza the way it
should be without the abomination that is pineapple
on it and I'll cherish that memory etern

[Verse 4]
they say a pizza is only as good as its to
ppings but I beg to differ it's the cheese
and sauce that make it great not the slimy fruit that does not belong on
my plate or my pizza it
sours the whole experience and ruins
the pizza for everyone involved it's a tragedy that should never
have happened in the first place but at
least I can remember my pizza the
way it should be and
I'll hold onto that memory forever
as I take each bite of my pizza and savor
the taste of victory knowing that my pizza is pineapple
free and always will be as I remember it all too

[Verse 5]
time won't heal the wound that is pineapple on
a pizza it's a traumatic experience that I'll never get
over but at least I can remember my pizza
the way it should be and I'll hold onto that thought
as I take each bite of my pizza and savor
the taste of victory knowing that my pizza is
pineapple free and always
will be as I remember it all

because there it is again that slimy
fruit on my pizza slice it just doesn't compute still
I'll never understand
why anyone would do that to
themselves it's a disgrace to
the pizza world a trav
esty unfolding right
before my very eyes
and I just can't look
away as I take another

[Verse 6]
and I was never a fan of pineapple on a pizza
but now it's a hard limit for me I just
can't bring myself to try it again
it's a betrayal of everything that is
good and pure in this world and I won
't stand for it I'll fight against it with every
fiber of my being and
I'll remember It all too well as I
take each bite of my pizza and
savor the taste of victory
