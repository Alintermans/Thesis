[Verse 1]
two slices tried and my ver
dict is clear trying to shirk icianally
from that pineapple pie
for a delicacy that won't make
me want to run and hide behind the fridge in disgu
e for a true delight

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to wash away the taste in my head
and I i am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I swallow with
care what's going on inside my mouth
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on in
my mouth and I say hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on in

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh uh u
oh oh
oh
oh uh u

[Verse 2]
and I tried
oh my god did I tried
I tried every
slice of pizza pie dis
gusting and
I cried oh my god did
I cried every single bite
for deliverance

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to wash away the taste in my head
and I i am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I swallow with
care what's going on inside my mouth
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on
in my mouth and I say
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on in
and I say hey hey hey
wake in the morning and step outside
take a deep
breath and I swallow with care inside
my mouth and
I scream hey what's going on in
and I say hey hey hey
wake in the morning and step outside
take a deep breath and
I swallow with care inside my mouth
and I scream
hey what's going on in my mouth

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh uh u

[Outro]
two slices tried and my life
is still trying to get away from that great
big mistake of pineapple
