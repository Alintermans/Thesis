[Verse 1]
now I've heard there's a culinary
abomination that's a pity
pineapple on a pizza pie yeah you know it
it clashes with the cheese and sauce
the sweet and savory collide
it's a monstrosity disguised as delight

[Chorus]
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie

[Verse 2]
you thought it'd be an exotic
addition to your pie but no
the flavors don't complement they contrad
it's a sweet and savory mess
it's just a recipe for distress
it's a pineapple pizza tragedy sad

[Chorus]
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie

[Verse 3]
you say it's just a difference
of opinion but I insist
it's a gastronomic disaster that pers
the combination is absurd trust me
it's not a tasty fantasy
it's a pineapple pizza curse I resist

[Chorus]
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie

[Verse 4]
I tried it once I gave it chance
but now I can't even stand a
glimpse of pineapple on a pizza slice it
ruins all the other toppings
makes me want to scream and shout it
pineapple pizza's just not worth the price it

[Chorus]
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie
pineapple off the pizza pie

[Outro]
pineapple off the pizza pie

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I've tried it sure
I used to like pineapple before I knew
but now it's just a flavor I abhor
and every bite I take is
pineapple pizza I can't ignore it no

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time I tried it once
I wanted to give it a chance
but now I never want to see it on a
pizza slice again it's not romance
and remember when I took a
bite I couldn't even swallow it no way it

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a reason for
a sweet and savory pairing
but pineapple on a pizza it's just not
the right combination I'm declaring
it's not a flavor that you savor
it's a pineapple pizza I can't abide
