[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the recipes and the
pizza toppings they told
pepperoni and its
pineapple and its
but I'm not the kind of
person that it goes well with my stomach told me so

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go eatery
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something ed
with some toppings gifts yes please
some cheese and pepper
just something I can
digest easily without
heartburn or regret must
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just
like this pizza to
oh I want something just
like this pizza topping oh oh
oh I want something just
like this pizza to
oh I want something just
like this pizza topping oh oh
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the ingredients and
the cooking methods they
told me to avoid it
but pineapple on a
pizza is like a dream
that I can't wake up from reality

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go eatery
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something ed
with some toppings gifts yes please
some cheese and pepper
just something I can
digest easily without
heartburn or regret must

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like
this pizza topping oh oh

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
pepperoni and che
oh I want something
just like this pizza to
oh I want something just like this
pepperoni and che
oh I want something
just like this pizza to

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something ed
with some toppings gifts yes please
some cheese and pepper
just something I can
digest easily without
heartburn or regret must
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
