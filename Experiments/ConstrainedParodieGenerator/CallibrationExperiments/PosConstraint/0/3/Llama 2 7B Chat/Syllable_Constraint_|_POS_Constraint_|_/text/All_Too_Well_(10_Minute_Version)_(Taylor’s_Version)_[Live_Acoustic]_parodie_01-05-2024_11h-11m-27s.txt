[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
how could you even think of putting it on
it's like a sin against humanity and
good taste buds alike don't you agree it

[Verse 2]
the cheese is melted to perfection and the pepper
are perfectly cooked but the pineapple is
like a foreign object in a beautiful dance

and I know It's wrong but I
can't help but feel a strong
urge to put it on top of the pie and mix it
in with the

because the flavors blend together in a
delicious harmony and the sweetness of the pineapple
balances out the savor
of the cheese and pepperoni

[Verse 3]

the combination of flavors and textures is like a symphony
playing in my mouth and I can't help but sing along with
the pineapple's sweetness leading the way and the che
and pepperoni following close behind in perfect harm
synchord it's like a pizza revolution and
I'm leading the charge with my pineapple topping and
you're all invited to join me in this pizza upright
