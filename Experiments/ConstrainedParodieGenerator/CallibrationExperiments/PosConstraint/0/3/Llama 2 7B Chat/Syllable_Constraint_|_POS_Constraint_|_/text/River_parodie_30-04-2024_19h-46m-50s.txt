[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fan of pineapple
on my pizza had to take
been a lover of the sweet and tangy taste since I was a
kid but now I see the error of my ways it's time to
admit that pineapple has got
to go it's not a topping that I want near me
well little one I don

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his mouth agape to catch
flack from all sides for putting fruit
on his pizza instead of pepper
sweat jackets and dress slacks mixed with a little bit
of disbelief at how I could do this to him
it's a chess match he's on my back like a
jetpack and he's trying to take me down with his next move
he's kept track of all my pizza toppings and he's not afraid to call
me out on it I should have
known better than to put pineapple on my pie but now
it's too late the damage is done and I have to
face the consequences of my actions so I'll just say
goodbye pineapple and hello
new toppings that will make my pizza great again oh
and by the way little one I don't want to admit to this
mistake anymore if it's gonna cause pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fan of pineapple

well little one I'm done

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned into a lifetime
of regret and sorrow for putting pineapple
on my pizza instead of pepperoni
it was a mistake that I can't ignore
he found out and now I'm in the doghouse once again
I should have known better than to stray from the classic
toppings but now I'm paying the price for my mistake so
I'll just stick to the basics from now on and leave the experimenting
to the amateurs little one I don't want to admit to this
mistake anymore if it's gonna cause
pain the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run goodbye pineapple and hello pe
perfectly topped pizza once again oh and
by the way little one I don't want
to admit to this mistake any
more if it's gonna cause pain so I'll just say good
bye pineapple and hello pepperon
I don't want to hear
it anymore the end it's time to move on
from this mistake and start fresh with a new topping that will make
mine
