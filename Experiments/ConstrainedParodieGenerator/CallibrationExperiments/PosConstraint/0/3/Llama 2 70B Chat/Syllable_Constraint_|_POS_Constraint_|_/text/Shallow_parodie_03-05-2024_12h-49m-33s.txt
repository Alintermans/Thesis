[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me somethin
is pineapple on pizza really
somethin' that you need
or is it just a phase you're going

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm callin
in all the good slices I find myself scroll
in' for
change and in the bad times I fear this

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me somethin

ian pizza cra
ze or do you need more ain't it hard

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in all the good slices I find myself long
in' for
change and in the bad times I fear this

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dip in
I'll never touch the sau
ce crash through the surface where the toppings can
't hurt us we're far from the shall

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow in
the sha ha la la la la low in
the sha ha shallow we're far
from the deep dish now lady

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ah ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dip in
I'll never touch the sau
ce crash through the surface where the toppings can
't hurt us we're far from the shall

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow
in the sha ha la la la la low
in the sha ha shallow
we're far from the deep dish now
