oh man what a world the things I
hear people say pineapple has no place on a pizza
some put it on their pizza and break the
rules of the pizza game so I'll never let it go and let
it be a part of the pizza
I've taken two slices of cheese from the pie that was meant

what a world the things I hear people say pineapple has
no place on a pizza some put it on
their pizza and break the rules of the pizza game so I'll nev

[Chorus]

of the pizza in my heart
in my heart I'll keep
it pure in my heart I'll keep
it pure in my heart
