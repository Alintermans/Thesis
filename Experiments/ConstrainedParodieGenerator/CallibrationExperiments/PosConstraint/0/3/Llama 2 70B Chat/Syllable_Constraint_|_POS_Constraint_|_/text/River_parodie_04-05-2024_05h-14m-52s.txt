pineapple to the party hat

from the chains of misguided flavors and embrace
the classic taste of a traditional
pizza pie that's how it's meant to be ough to admit it
but pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza it's just not meant to
be so let's all just agree
to keep it simple and classic and let the river run
free from the pineapple pizza travesty ough
tough to admit it but it's time to move on ough tough to
admit it but pineapple doesn
't belong on a pizza it's time to let it go ough
