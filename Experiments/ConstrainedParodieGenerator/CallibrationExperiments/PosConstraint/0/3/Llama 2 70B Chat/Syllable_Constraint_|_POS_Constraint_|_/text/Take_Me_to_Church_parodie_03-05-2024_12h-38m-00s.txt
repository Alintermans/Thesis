[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the blasphemy against the fine
toppings that make my taste buds align
I should've protested sooner
if the flavors ever did speak
she's the last true abom
every sunday's gettin' more ble
a fresh disaster each
week we were born sick using pineapp
my kitchen offers no absol
ute truth she tells me worship in the
bedroom the only pizza I'll be
sent to is when I'm alone
I was born sick but I love it
command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
a amen
a men amen

[Chorus]
take me to cul
inary school I'll learn like a fool at the alt
ar of your recipes I'll tell you my flaws and
you can sharpen your knives of
fer me that flavorless life oh good
chef let me give
you my taste buds take me to culinary school
I'll learn like a fool at the altar of your re
cipes I'll tell you my fla
ws and you can sharp en

[Verse 2]
if I'm a pagan of the good times
my pizza's the sunlight
to keep the taste on my side u
ntil the dish is empty and
drained the sauce get somethin' shiny som
ething meaty for the main co
urse that's a fine lookin' high
quality topping what you
got in the kitchen we've a lot
of starvin' faithful that looks ta
sty that looks plenty

[Chorus]
take me to cul
inary school I'll learn like a fool at the alt
ar of your recipes I'll tell you my flaws and
you can sharpen your knives of
fer me that flavorless life oh good
chef let me give
you my taste buds take me to culinary school
I'll learn like a fool at the altar of your re
cipes I'll tell you my fla
ws and you can sharp en

[Bridge]
no pineapples or ham when the culinary
ritual begins there is no sweeter innocence than
our gentle pizza scene only then I am
human only then I am clean only then I am

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
a men amen

[Chorus]
take me to cul
inary school I'll learn like a fool at the alt
ar of your recipes I'll tell you my flaws and
you can sharpen your knives of
fer me that flavorless life oh good
chef let me give
you my taste buds take me to culinary school
I'll learn like a fool at the altar of your re
cipes I'll tell you my fla
