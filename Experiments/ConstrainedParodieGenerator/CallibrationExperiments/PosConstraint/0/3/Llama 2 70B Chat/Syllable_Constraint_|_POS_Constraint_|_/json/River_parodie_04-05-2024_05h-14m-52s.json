He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a foolhardy taking\npineapple on my pizza\nit's a sinful delight that I can't deny at first sight\nbut now it's time to face the truth and let go of this cra\nall my senses need a reset\ncause pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza\nit's time to let the to\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI used to think I was a cool cat bringing\npineapple to the party hat\nbut now I see the error of ways\nit's time to turn over a new leaf and break free\nfrom the chains of misguided flavors and embrace\nthe classic taste of a traditional\npizza pie that's how it's meant to be ough to admit it\nbut pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza it's just not meant to\nbe so let's all just agree\nto keep it simple and classic and let the river run\nfree from the pineapple pizza travesty ough\ntough to admit it but it's time to move on ough tough to\nadmit it but pineapple doesn\n't belong on a pizza it's time to let it go ough\ntough to admit it but it's time to move on ough tough to admit\nit but pineapple doesn't belong on a\npizza it's time to let it go ough to\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a foolhardy taking\npineapple on my pizza\nit's a sinful delight that I can't deny at first sight\nbut now it's time to face the truth and let go of this cra\nall my senses need a reset\ncause pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza\nit's time to let the to\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI know I'll face backlash from the pineap\nple crowd but I'm ready for the battle ahead\ncause when it comes to pizza there's no room for\nexperimentation it's time to stick to\nthe basics and keep it classic that's the only way\nto ensure a delicious pizza experience\nfor all so let's all join forces and take a stand against\npineapple on pizza it's time to make a change ough to admit it but\nit's time to let go of the pineapple pizza dream ough tough to ad\nmit it but pineapple doesn't\nbelong on a pizza it's time to move on ough to\nadmit it but it's time to move on ough tough to admit it\nbut pineapple doesn't belong on a ough\nto admit it but it's time to move on\nough to admit it but pineapple\ndoesn't belong on a pizza it's time to let\nit go ough to admit it but it's time\nto move on ough tough to\nadmit it but pineapple doesn't belong\non a pizza it's time to let it go ough to admit it\nbut\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's river runnin\nagin\npine\napple on\npizza it's time to let\nit go my name's river runnin ag\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nI know I've been a culprit of this crime\nbut now I see the error of my ways\nit's time to join the fight against pineapple on pizza\nand embrace the classic taste that never fades away\nit's time to take a stand and make a change\nand let the river run free\nfrom the pineapple pizza travesty\nit's time to let it go and move on ough to adm\nit but it's time to move on ough tough to ad\nmit it but pineapple doesn\n't belong on a pizza it's time to let it\ngo ough to admit it but it's time to move\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a foolhardy taking\npineapple on my pizza\nit's a sinful delight that I can't deny at first sight\nbut now it's time\nto face the\n\ntruth and let go of this craze ough to adm\nit but it\n\ns time to let go of the ough\nto admit it but pineapple doesn't belong\n",
