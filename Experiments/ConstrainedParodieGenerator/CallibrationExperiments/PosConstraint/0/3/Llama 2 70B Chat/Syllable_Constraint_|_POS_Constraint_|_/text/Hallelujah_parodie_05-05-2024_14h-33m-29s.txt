[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a crime having pineapple
on a beautiful pie that's just
a perfect combination of
sauce cheese and toppings all in harmony oh

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness that's new
but to me it's just a bitter
betrayal of the flavors that we know oh
like putting ketchup on a hot
dog or mayonnaise on a taco
it's just not something that we do oh no no

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong

[Verse 3]
you argue that it's a matter
of personal taste and prefer
ence but to me it's just a matter of fact
pineapple has no place on a pizza
it's like putting icing on a
corn dog or mustard on a cinnamon roll

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong

[Verse 4]
I know you think you're being bold
and adventurous with your toppings
but to me it's just a recipe for dis
aster a culinary cat
astrophe a gastronomic sin
oh pineapple on pizza oh how it just

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong
oh pineapple on pizza oh

[Outro]
pineapple on pizza oh how

[Additional Lyrics]
you say you love the way it
tastes but to me it's just a shame
you're ruining a perfectly good pie oh
it's like taking a masterpiece and tag
ging it with a spray can oh no
it's just not right it's just not right oh no oh no

[Additional Lyrics]
I know you think you're being hip
and trendy with your pineapple
toppings but to me it's just a fad a phase
a culinary aberration
oh pineapple on pizza oh
how it just don't make no sense oh no oh no

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a place for it
in hawaii or somewhere ex
otic but not here not now not on my plate
no pineapple on pizza no way no
how it's just a travesty a cul
inary abomination oh no oh no
