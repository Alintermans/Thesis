[Intro]
is it wrong to desire a pizza

[Verse 1]
with the toppings of my choice
no pineapple in sight the thought
of it makes me rejoice u
it's a travesty

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later how
I still can't believe you'd put pineapple on a pizza
it's such a crime in every pizza lover's bed for som
ething greater than pineapple on a pie in the sky higher

[Chorus]
was it over when you ruined the pizza
was it over when you disregarded the
tradition come here I whisper
in your ear in your dream as you pass
out from eating pineapple on a pizza

[Post-Chorus]
is it is it is it

[Verse 2]
when you lost control and put
pineapple on a pie
red sauce white cheese blue box top
my new pizza has no

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you
there were flashing lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza toppings
out of sight only rumors about
anchovies and ol
ives and my whispered sighs oh lord
I think about jumping off
of very tall ovens just
to see you come running and say the one thing

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred awkward pizza dates later
if it's got pineapple I will presume that you'll probably hate it oh
you dream of my pizza before it called you a lying traitor
you search in every pizzeria's menu for something greater

[Chorus]
was it over when you ruined the pizza
was it over when you disregarded the
tradition come here I whisper
in your ear in your dream as you pass
out from eating pineapple on a pizza

[Post-Chorus]
uh u
is it is it is it
uh u
is it is it

[Bridge]
think I didn't see you
there were flashing lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza toppings
out of sight only rumors about
anchovies and ol
ives and my whispered sighs oh lord
I think about jumping off
of very tall ovens just to see
you come running and say the one thing I've been

[Outro]
wanting but no pineap
please let's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizzas later
I was hoping you'd be there and say the
one thing I've been wanting but
no pineapple on a
pizza
is it is it is it is it is it is it
