[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain it clear
it doesn't belong there

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to collect my thought before I
start to rant about this ab
horrent topping that you see
on a beautiful pie that
should be savory not sweet oh
why would you do this to me with
a fruit that doesn't belong
I knew when I ordered pepperonI toppings
you'd do the opposite of what was right
and now my meal is ruined and it's just not tight so don't tell me
it's a personal choice when
it comes to pizza toppings
you clearly weren't aware that you made me angry
so if you really want to know

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain it clear it doesn't here
belong there wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't
true mm mm when I'm away

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask me to meet
at the pizza parlor down the street
but when I get there you're ordering for me
a hawaiian that I can't eat oh
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
cause you don't understand what
makes a good pizza no oh

[Verse 3]
and I don't go around telling people what's wrong with
your pizza choices never judge others
for their toppings that's not my style but you oh you
you made me hate this pizza joint and now it
makes me sad so don't waste my time with
your hawaiian crust don't try to
make me feel bad I could talk about every time that you
ruined my meal but I'd have an empty line cause you
never listened to my needs as a customer so I
shut my mouth for you cause I wanted to be

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
always said you were misunderstood
made all my meals your own just
leave me alone yeah fuck you ah goddam
ah
fuck you
oh
