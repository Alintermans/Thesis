I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong it was
like a crime scene without a care but something

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my hungry gaze autumn leaves
falling down like anchovies In place and I
can picture it after all these days and I know
it's long gone and that magic's not here no more

[Pre-Chorus]
and I might be okay but
I'm not fine at all oh oh
oh and I know it's long gone and there was nothing
else I could

night we're arguing about pineapple on pizza down the
stairs I was there I cannot
believe you did that and there we

[Verse 3]
are again when nobody had to know you kept pineapp
le on pizza like a secret but I kept my mouth shut like an o
