[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been thinking bout pizza
the toppings and the che
pepperoni and sa
usage they all agree
but pineapple just
doesn't fit the scene no
it's a fruit that's just not meant to be on a pizza

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said pineapple on top
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for a topping
that's gonna make me frown and
pineapple on a
pizza just doesn't
seem right to me does it to
you does it to you does
it to you too does it to

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
this I want something
just like this I want som
ething just like this oh I want
something just like this do
o doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo doo do

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading reviews of
pizzas all around the
world they all say the same
no pineapple on top
it's a sin it's a crime
it's a culinary
catastrophe it's a no go for me for

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
they said pineapple on top how
much you want to risk I
m not looking for a topping
that's gonna make me frown and
pineapple on a
pizza just doesn't
seem right to me does it to
you does it to you does

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for a topping
that's gonna make me frown and
pineapple on a
pizza just doesn't
seem right to me does it to
you does it to you does
it to you too does it to

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
