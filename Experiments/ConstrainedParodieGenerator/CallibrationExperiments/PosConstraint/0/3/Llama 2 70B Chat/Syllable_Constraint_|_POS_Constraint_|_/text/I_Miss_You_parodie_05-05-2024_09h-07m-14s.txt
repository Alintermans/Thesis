[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I diss you I diss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pineapple on my plate
the monstrosity that I can't ab
late the thought of it makes me
irate it doesn't belong
it's not a topping that I crave we can't
live with this on our pie
and we'll never find a compromise
in the night we'll realize was a mistake
we'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I diss you I diss you
I diss you I diss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor and the taste
I cannot enjoy my meal in peace ton
I need a break from this abom
ination this strange
unusual topping on my pizza screen
and as I stare at the pie
I count the slices that are
missing out on cheese and pepperon
like a crime that needs to be solved
will you take it away and
stop this pain tonight stop this pain tonight
will you take it way

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head
I diss you I diss you
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head
I diss you I diss you

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head
I diss you I diss you
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head
I diss you I diss you
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head
I diss you I diss you
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head
I diss you I diss you

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I diss you I diss you
I diss you I diss you
I diss you I diss you
I diss you I diss you
