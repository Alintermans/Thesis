[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' while we're meetin' some people say
it's a topping that's quite neat but I don
t think it's somethin' that I'd be
eatin' on a pie that's meant to be sav
ory not sweet that's just how I feel about it and
I'm hopin' that you feel the same
about this topping
that's causin' so much debate all over the place what's your take
on this pineapple pizza craze that's got us all

[Pre-Chorus]
do we really need this fruit on our pizza
can't we just stick to the classics like pepperon
I and sausage or mushrooms and olives don't
you think it's time that we take a stand and make a choice

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
way that pizza used to be
ever thought of
just stickin' to
the basics and
keepin' it simple
like a margherita or
even a four che
ese that's all we need

[Verse 2]
so have you got the gut
s to take a stand and make a change or
are you gonna sit back and let this pineap
ple trend continue to take over the menu at hand
I'm wonderin' if your taste buds are still open to new things
or if you're just gonna follow the crowd and sing do
you feel the same way that I do about this to

[Pre-Chorus]
do we really need this fruit on our pizza
can't we just stick to the classics like pepperon
I and sausage or mushrooms and olives don't
you think it's time that we take a stand and make a choice

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the way that pizza used
to be ever thought of just
stickin' to the basics and
keepin' it simple like a margher
ita or even a four cheese that's all
we need crawlin' back to the way
that pizza used to be craw
lin' back to the way
that pizza used to

[Outro]
do we really need this fruit on our pizza
can't we just stick to the classics like pepperon
I and sausage or mushrooms and olives don't
you think it's time that we take a stand and make a choice
do we really need this fruit on our pizza to
be happy with our meal or can we just keep it
simple and classic like it used to be back in the day
