[Intro]
come on pizza lovers we wanna say no to

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
top of your pie it's such a
mistake don't you know why don't we let
it go it's not worth the debate
nothing to gain
when the toppings don't align
pineapple doesn't belong
and it's time to move on oh oh oh now

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
of the pizza deliver
what's the point of pineapple up on top
when it doesn't belong there
ringing the bell
nobody wants to hear the door
your taste buds live by themselves
they just want to know what's real oh oh oh now

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
move on get a new pie order something
else don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave pineapple behind don't follow
the crowd I don't wanna talk about who's wrong or

[Outro]
right
you know it
it's not the same as it was you know
it's not the same as it
