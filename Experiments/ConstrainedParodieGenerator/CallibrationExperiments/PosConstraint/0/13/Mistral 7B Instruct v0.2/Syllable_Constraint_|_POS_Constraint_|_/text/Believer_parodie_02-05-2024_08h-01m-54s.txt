[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
a taste that just won't persist

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you argue with me about this trendy
topping on my pizza
I'm the one who orders tradition
my palate's the captain of

[Pre-Chorus]
I was puzzled by the debate
adding pineapple to my plate's
a mystery that I couldn't
solve with just a single state's flavor profile and taste
but I've tried it once or twice or
more than I care to admit in
my quest for understanding this
pineapple pizza paradox

[Chorus]
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in the old
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in the bold
pain of pineapple on my pizza pie's top
my life's a love story that started
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in the fold

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the culinary
heavens above us all
for the sake of our taste buds call off
this pineapple on a pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
I was taken aback at
the sight of this controversial
topping on my plate's attack
but I've come to accept the fact
that some like it hot and sweet and savory all at
once and I'll respect their right to choose their own pathway to taste
it's their pizza

[Chorus]
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in the old
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in the bold
pain of pineapple on my pizza pie's top
my life's a love story that started
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in the fold

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the fire and the sauce
you're the face of the future
the love in my heart and the
pineapple on my pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
but I've come to see the light in the pineapple on
my pizza pie's top and the way it brings people together
we may never

[Chorus]
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in the old
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in the bold
pain of pineapple on my pizza pie's top
my life's a love story that started
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in the fold
