[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
its weird and not so cool
pepperoni and
cheese and olive's du
but I'm not the kind of eater that it's true

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said eat what you love and
take a risk she said to
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some exotic fruit to
a spicy pepper
a savory treat
just something I can eat and
someone I can greet with
a slice of pure delight and

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo da da da da do
doo da da da da
doo da da da da do
oh I want something just like this
doo da da da da do
doo da da da da
doo da da da da do
oh I want something just like this
doo da da da da doo da

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
it's not a classic com
ham and bacon and on
ions and mushrooms some
but I'm not the kind of eater that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said eat what you crave and take
a risk she said to me
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some exotic flavor
a veggie delight
a meaty feast or
just something I can eat and
someone I can share it

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo da da da da do
doo da da da da
doo da da da da do
oh I want something just like this
doo da da da da do
doo da da da da
doo da da da da do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some exotic fruit to
just something I can
eat and someone I
can share a moment with and
enjoy the simple things
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
