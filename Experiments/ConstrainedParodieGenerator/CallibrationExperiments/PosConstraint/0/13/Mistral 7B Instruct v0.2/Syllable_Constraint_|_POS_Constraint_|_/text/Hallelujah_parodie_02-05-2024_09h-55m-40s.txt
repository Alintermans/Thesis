[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that italians made and it caused a
disagreeable surprise for some folks ya'll know
it goes like this with pineapple
the fifth syllable fallacy
the major clash of savory and sweet all

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Verse 2]
your taste was strong but you needed proof
you saw a pineapple on the
top ruining the harmony of the dish
she sprinkled it on your pepper
she chopped it up and made it smother
and from your plate she drew the hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Verse 3]
you say I took the pineapple
I don't even know the name
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a blend of flavors in every
slice it doesn't matter which you
tried the sweet or the savory halleluj

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I tried to touch
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of taste
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Outro]
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this table I've walked this
floor I used to eat alone before I knew
and I've seen your pineapple on the cheese
love is not a victory fe
ast it's a cold and it's a broken halleluj

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy cheese was moving too
and every bite we drew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to argue with someone who outdrew
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
