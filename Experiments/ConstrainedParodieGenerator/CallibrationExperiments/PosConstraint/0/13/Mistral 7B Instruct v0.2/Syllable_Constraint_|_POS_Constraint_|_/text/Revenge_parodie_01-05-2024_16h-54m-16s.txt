[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a pizza topping that was sound
but now I see the error of that
pineapple on a pizza
you agree

[Verse]
I've ordered pies with ham and pe
pepperoni and olives galore but oh me deceit
oh pineapple on a pizza world
if I could take it back would I try it once
some like it hot some like it mild
but I'd have thought that I would never be so wildly def
iled with pineapple on a pizza
but I don't wanna let it slide so on my plate it'll
remain until I rot in pine
apple on a pizza land I'll rot in pineapple on
a pizza I'll rot in pineapple
on a pizza I'll rot in pineapple on
a pizza I'll rot in pineap
le on a pizza I'll rot in pineapple on a pie
oh pineapple on a pizza I'll
rot in pineapple on a pizza I'll rot in pineapple

[Chorus]
in my grave of cheese
in my grave of cheese
in my grave of cheese I'll rot
in my grave of cheese
in my grave of cheese I'll rot
in my grave of cheese

[Outro]
in my grave of cheese
I'll rot I'll rot I'll rot
is my taste your pleasure
is all of my taste your pleasure
enjoy
