[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta hide from the sun because I hate pineap
it started out on a pie but now it's on a pizza
what was once a sweet delight has become a hass
now I'm watchin' in shock as they top it with a
pineapple ring and I'm feelin' a sense of loss
they're savourin' their slice and my hunger grows dim
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savourin' the taste
of this tropical fruit
let me go
I just can't partake in this fruit on
a pizza debate

[Chorus]
pineapplesity turning food into
the sea of disappointment
swimmin' through savory lies
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin' me
open up my eager eyes
'cause I'm mr reject

[Guitar Solo]
