my lover's got a qu
she's the pineapple at the table
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've ordered pizza sans
if the menu ever did speak
pineapple's the last true
every sunday's gettin' more bland
a fresh controversy
we were born picky they all say it
my kitchen offers no guarante
she tells me change the toppings upside
the only pizza I'll be sent to
is when I'm alone with you
I was born picky but I love
command me to be more

[Pre-Chorus]
aha ha

I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me my tasteless taste
oh good cheflet let me give you a

[Bridge]
no pizzas or chefs when the toppings begin to
there is no sweeter harmony than our gentle din
in the madness and dough of that sad kitchen scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh aha
aha ha ha

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that tasteless taste
oh good cheflet let me give you a
take me to the

I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that tasteless taste
