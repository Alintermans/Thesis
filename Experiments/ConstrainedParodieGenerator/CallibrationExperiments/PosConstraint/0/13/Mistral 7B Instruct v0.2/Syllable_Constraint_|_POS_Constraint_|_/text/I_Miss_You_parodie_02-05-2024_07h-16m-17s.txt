[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pineapple on my pie
the unwelcome guest atop the pizza
the unsuspecting palate
of clashing flavors in the
kitchen of despair we share if we want it
where you can always find me
and we'll have tranquility on tap
and in the night we'll wish this never was
we'll wish this never was

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where art thou and I'm so sorry
I cannot savor savory dishes
I crave someone and always long
this strange obsession
comes creeping on with every bite I take
and as I taste it I rec
all the memories of pine
spoiling pizzas with its sweet design
like indecision to decline
and hear your voice of reason
will you come clean and stop this pain tonight
stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
