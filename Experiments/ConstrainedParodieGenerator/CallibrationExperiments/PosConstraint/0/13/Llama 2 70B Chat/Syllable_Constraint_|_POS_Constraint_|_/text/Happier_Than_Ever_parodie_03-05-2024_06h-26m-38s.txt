[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain it clear
it doesn't belong there

[Verse 1]
give me a slice or two to think of something new
to write a song about things
that don't belong on a
pizza with cheese and sauce and
pepperoni and sausage too
you can put it on a salad
or grill it up as a side
but don't you dare put it on a pizza that
I have to abide by the rules of the
pizza gods up above don't you know that it's just wrong don't you
understand it's a pizza
not a fruit stand don't you
get it don't you get it man it's just not right it
just doesn't belong there it's like

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain it clear it doesn't bel
ong there wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't true
mm mm mm mm mm mm just

[Verse 2]
you call me up and say you're hungry
and you're craving something sweet and ju
icy but I got news for you baby that
ain't no pizza treat it's a fruit it
ain't got no place on a
pizza pie you can top it with
bacon or mushrooms or olives
or even some anchovies

[Verse 3]
but don't you go putting pineapple up in there no
matter how hard you try it just don't
belong there it's like putting ketchup on a hot
dog or mayonnaise on a pizza crust it
just don't make no sense it's like nails on
a chalkboard it's like a train off its
tracks it's like a world without pizza it's just wrong it's just wrong
it's just wrong it's just wrong it's just wrong it's just wrong it
just don't belong there it's like it's like it's like it's like
it's just wrong it's just wrong it's just wrong it's just

[Outro]
you ruined the pizza game
you ruined the pizza game always
said you were misunderstood
made all my pizza dreams turn to dust just
le
a ve
me
al one
alone
