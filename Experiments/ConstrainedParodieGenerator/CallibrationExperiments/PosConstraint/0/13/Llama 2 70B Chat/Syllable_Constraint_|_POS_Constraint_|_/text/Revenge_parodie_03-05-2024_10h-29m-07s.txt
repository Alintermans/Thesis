[Intro]
I think I've found a way to express
my feelings about pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime against
humanity it's such a
disaster

[Verse]
I've seen the horrors of hawai
ian pizza it's a travesty to me people put
pineapple on their pizza and they
act like it's no big deal but it's a sin to
me it's like they're killing a piece
of my soul every time they do it and I can't
let it go unspoken I must speak out
against this atrocity and make them see the light how can
people do this how can they live
with themselves how can they sleep at night knowing they've ruined
a perfectly good pizza with that
disgusting fruit that doesn't belong on a
pizza it's a crime it's a sin
it's a travesty it's a catastrophe it's a cal
amity it's a an abomina
tion it's a desecration it's a defilement it's a

[Chorus]
in my mind it's a
crime it's a sin it
makes me want to scream when I
see pineapple on
a pizza it's a disgra
ce it's a disas

[Outro]
I'll never let it
go I'll never let it
be I'll never let it
be forgotten I'll never let
it slide
