[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater, been a
talking smack about pineapp
been a lover of pizza without the crap on top of it
all my sins need a slice of cheese and pepperoni to
feel it washing over me well
little one I don't want to admit to som

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's coming home with a stomach ache from e
ating pineapple on his pie
sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched on
his breath smells like a tropical island but it
ain't no vacation when he's cheating on his
girl with a hawaiian pizza it's a
chess match she's on his back like a jetpack she's kept track of
all his pizza toppings and guess who just happens to be moving on

got you I don't want you took advantage
in my thirst to pursue why do I do

box and preach my sermon and speech detergent and
bleach is burning the wound cause now with her
in the womb we can't
