And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI protest against it\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\npineapple\nthe abomination on\ntop of my pizza pie oh the horror\nthe thought of it makes me feel\nlike I'm in a nightmare can\nwe please just keep it simple and avoid the\ncombination of sweet and\nsavory that just doesn't belong\nit's like someone took a peanut butter\nand jelly sandwich and\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss pizza the way\nit was meant to be e\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere is the logic in putting\nfruit on a beautiful pie crust and che\nese please tell me who thought this was\na good idea\nI cannot fathom why anyone would do\nthis to a perfectly good\npizza it's like taking a\nmasterpiece and painting mustaches\non the mona lisa why must\nyou ruin something so pure\ncan't we just stick to pepperoni\nand mushrooms and on\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't ruin your pizza with pineapple\nalready the voice in\nmy head is screaming don\n\nt do it don't do it don't do it\nplease don't do it don\nt do it don't do\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't ruin your pizza with pineapple\nalready the voice in\nmy head is screaming don\n\nt do it don't do it don't do it\nplease don't do it don\nt do it don't do\n\ndon't waste your time on pineapple pizza\nyou're already the voice\ninside my head is begg\n\ning you don't do it don't do it don\nt do it please don't\ndo it don't do it\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss pizza the way\nit was meant to be e\nI miss pizza the way\n",
