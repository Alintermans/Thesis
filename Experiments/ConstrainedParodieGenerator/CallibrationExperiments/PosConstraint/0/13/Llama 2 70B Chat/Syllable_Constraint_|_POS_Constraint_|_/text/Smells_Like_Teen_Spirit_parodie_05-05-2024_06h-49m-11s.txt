[Verse 1]
load up on toppings, bring your
it's fun to choose and to pretend
that pineapple has a place on a pie
oh no I know it's a crime pre

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less boring
here we are now confusing taste
I feel wrong and so ashamed here
with the toppings out it's less bore
a hawaiian a pizza a
a disaster a flavor a

[Post-Chorus]
yeah hey ye

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at pizza than you
and for this flaw I feel ash
our taste buds have always been ab
and always will until we're through

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less boring
here we are now confusing taste
I feel wrong and so ashamed here
with the toppings out it's less bore
a hawaiian a pizza a
a disaster a flavor a

[Post-Chorus]
yeah hey ye

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I eat
oh yeah I guess it's just a treat
I found it odd it's odd to find
oh well whatever never mind

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello how strange
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less boring
here we are now confusing taste
I feel wrong and so ashamed here
with the toppings out it's less bore
a hawaiian a pizza a
a disaster a flavor a
