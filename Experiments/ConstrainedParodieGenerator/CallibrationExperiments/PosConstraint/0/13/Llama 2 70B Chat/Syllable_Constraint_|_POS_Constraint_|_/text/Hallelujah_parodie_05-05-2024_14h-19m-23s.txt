[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a crime it's not divine it
just don't belong on a pie
it's like putting pickles on a
chocolate cake it's just not right get it out of

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizza it's just

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness to the
sauce but to me it's just a no
it's like putting ketchup on a steak it's just
not worth the dough it's a crime and
a shame and it's just not right get it
out of sight hallelujah hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizza it's just

[Verse 3]
you say it's a matter of taste
but to me it's just a waste it
just don't belong on a pie it's like a
mistake it's like putting mustard on a
hot dog it's just not right get it
out of here hallelujah hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizza it's just

[Verse 4]
I know you think it's okay but
to me it's just a fray it's not a
good way to end a meal it's like a bad jo
ke it's just not funny halleлу
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelu

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizza it's just
not right get it out of here get
it out of here hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
hallelujah hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
I know you think it's just a
topping but to me it's a no
it's like putting ice cream on a pizza it
just don't go it's like a broken heart
it's just not right get it out of
sight hallelujah hallelujah hallelu

[Additional Lyrics]
you say it's a matter of choice
but to me it's just a voice that
says it's wrong it's like a sign that says turn back
it's just not right get it out of here
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a pizza in
heaven but to me it's just a
no it's not a place for pineapple it's just
not right get it out of here hallelu
jah hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
