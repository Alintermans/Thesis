[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up and declare

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my eager taste buds did you
we're ordering up a pie getting lost in
the endless options autumn leaves falling down like
and I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pizza's not the same no
more and I might be okay but I'm not fine at
all oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little pizza
you almost ordered a hawaiian you were looking over
at me pineapple on the
pizza wind in my hair I was

[Verse 3]
photo album on the counter your pizza choices were
turning heads you used to be a little kid with a plain cheese pizza
and your mother's telling stories bout you on the tee ball team
you told me bout your past thinking your future was me
and you were tossing me the pizza dough fuck the pineapple
key chain on the ground we were always skipping town
and I was thinking on the drive down any time now
he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it was
'til we were dead and gone and buried
check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
after three months in the grave
and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
but all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
ath sacred prayer and we
swear to remember it all too well

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you tore it all up
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you not
weeping in a party bathroom some
actress asking me what happened you that
s what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self effacing jo
kes sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come
and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old pizza cutter from that first
week cause it reminds you of innocence and it looks
like me you can't get rid
of it cause you remember it all

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pizza toppings stay
my age from when your hawaiian pizza
broke my heart and bones I'm a soldier who's ret
urning half my weight and did the love
affair maim you too cause in this city's barren
cold I still remember the
first pizza I ever had and how it
glistened as it fell I remem
ber it all too well just between

[Outro]
us did the love affair maim you all too well just between
us do you remember it all too well just between
us I remember it all too well wind in my hair I was there
down the stairs I was there you remember
it all too well sacred prayer I was
there I was there it was rare you re
member It all too well wind In my hair I
was there down the stairs I was there you re
member it all too well sacred prayer
I was there I was there it was rare
you remember it all too well
wind in my hair I was there down the stag
es I was there you remember it
all too well sacred prayer I was there
I was there it was rare you re
member it all too well wind in my hair
I was there down the stairs I was there
you remember it all too well sac
red prayer I was there I was there it was rare

[Spoken Outro]
I love pineapples so
