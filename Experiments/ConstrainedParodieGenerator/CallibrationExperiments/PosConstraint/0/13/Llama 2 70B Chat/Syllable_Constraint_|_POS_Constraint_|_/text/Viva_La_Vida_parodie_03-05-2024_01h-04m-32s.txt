[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza
toppings would pile high and higher
now it's just a memory makes me
want to cry and shed a te

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to think hawai
was the perfect combo but now it
makes me want to vomit and
never eat another pizza again
one minute it was my fav
next it was my worst nightmare
and I discovered that pineapple doesn
t belong on a pizza crust standing on

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple haters shouting la
la la la la la la la la la
be my pizza guide don't let
pineapple abide la la la la la
for some reason I can't explain
pineapple on pizza is
just a sin la la la
and that was when I loved pizza

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild cra
ve that made me try it once and
now it's ruined my pizza exper
ience forever more just the thought makes me
want to scream revolution
aries wait for pineapple to
disappear just a topping on a lonely
string mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm how

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple haters shouting la
la la la la la la la la la
be my pizza guide don't let
pineapple abide la la la la la
for some reason I can't explain
pineapple on pizza is just a sin
la la la la la la
and that was when I loved pizza
