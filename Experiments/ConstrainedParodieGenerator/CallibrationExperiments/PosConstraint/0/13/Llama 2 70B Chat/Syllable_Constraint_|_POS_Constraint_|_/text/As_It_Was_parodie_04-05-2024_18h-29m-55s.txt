[Intro]
come on pineapple lovers we wanna say good

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pineapple's on pizza it
I want you to hold out the pizza in your
hand why don't we leave it plain
nothin' to say
when pineapple gets in the way
seems pineapple cannot be
replaced and it's here to stay oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world pizza's just
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world pizza's just
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the phone
pineapple you're no good on
why are you sitting at home on the floor
what kind of toppings are you
ringin' the bell
and nobody's coming to help
your taste buds live by themselves
they just want to know that you're well oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world pizza's just
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world pizza's just
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home get ahead try a new pizza
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave pineapple behind follow your taste
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
