[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my appetite at the table
that monstrosity should not be allowed now

[Verse 2]
oh that sweet and savory clash of flavors so wrong
the ham and pineapple duet in my mouth
autumn leaves of disappointment falling down like
a bad dream after which I woke up with a

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that culinary sin is
a blight on my tongue forevermore oh oh oh
it's a crime

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on that slice of hell
a tropical disaster that should be in jail wind in hair
I remember it all too
well and there it was again on

[Verse 3]
cheese and tomato sauce can't hide the crime scene photo
of pineapple chunks scattered on the pizza floor oh god no please no
and you were tossing me a slice with a grin so wide saying
this is the best pizza ever trust me I promise
but I could see the twinkle in your eye betraying the truth
that you knew it was a monstrosity but you
just couldn't resist the temptation to inflict it
on an innocent soul like me who just wanted some good
food to eat but instead was served
a crime against nature and humanity
and I was thinking on the
drive home how could anyone do such a thing and then you
wondered where it went wrong as I ran to the bathroom

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there it was again in the middle of the
night we were feasting on the pizza of doom dancing around
the kitchen in the flu
orescent light down the stairs it
was a nightmare I remember it all too well and
there it was again when nobody had to know you kept
me like a secret but
I kept my dignity intact and

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you added pine
apple to it running
scared I was there I remember
it all too well and you call me up again just to remind
me of the culinary atrocity you inflicted
on me so casually cruel in the name
of experimentation a

[Verse 4]
time won't fly it's like I'm
paralyzed by the memory of that
disaster I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying
to erase it from my mind
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me
your own now you mail back my leftovers and I throw them away but you
keep my old number on speed dial
reminding me of the culinary
sin you committed
you can't undo it you can't erase
it from my memory I remember it all
too well and you call me up again just to remind me of the
pain you caused me so casually cruel in

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by the
memory of that disaster I'd like to be my old self again
but I'm still trying to erase it from my mind cheese
and tomato sauce can't hide the taste of shame
and did the pineapple chunks ruin the pizza
for you too did they leave a bitter taste in your mouth
just between us did the love
affair with pineapple maim you too

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on that slice of
hell a tropical disaster that should be in jail
wind in my hair I was
there I remember it all too
well and there it was again
on that pizza of do
om I remember it
all too well and there it
was again on that slice
of shame I remember it all

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at hiding my disgust but the punch
line goes pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza you know it's true just between us
did the love affair with pineapple maim you
all too well just between us do you
remember it all too well just between us it
was a crime against nature
and humanity and I remember
it all too well and I was there

[Outro]

im you all too well just between us do you rememb
er it all too well just between us I remember it all too
well wind in my hair I was there I was
there down the stairs I was there I was
