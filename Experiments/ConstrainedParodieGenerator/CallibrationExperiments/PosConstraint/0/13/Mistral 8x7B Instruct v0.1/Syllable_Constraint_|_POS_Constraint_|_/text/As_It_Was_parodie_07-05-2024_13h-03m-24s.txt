[Intro]
come on now folks and give an ear to me a tale

[Verse 1]
taste sensation
pineapple's not a valid
option for a pizza topping please believe
just leave it off the ledge and leave
the ham alone
why put fruit where cheese should be shown
it's just not how the dish should
ever be conceived oh no oh no oh

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple's causing a fall
why put it on a pizza base at all
what kind of monster would let
that happen to
a classic savory treat oh
no oh no oh no oh no
it's just not right at all oh no oh no oh

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home and try again with care and thought
don't just throw it on and hope for the best result
leave the pineapple for a tropical
fruit salad or a cocktail delight instead you see

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was before oh no
as it was not the same
