[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni and cheese
but pineapple just won
through reputation
it doesn't deserve to
be on a pizza pie like this one does belong here

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said taste is subjective
and who am I to diss
I'm not looking for a topping
that's too exotic or flash
just something simple
that tastes good with a
crust that I can bite into
something I can relish
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doodododo doodo
doodododo do
doodododo doodod
oh I want something just like this
doodododo doodo
doodododo do
doodododo doodod
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
but pineapple just won
through reputation it
doesn't deserve to be
on a pizza pie like
this one does belong here instead of ham and

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said taste is subjective
and who am I to diss
I'm not looking for a topping
that's too exotic or flash
just something simple
that tastes good with a
crust that I can bite into
something I can relish

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doodododo doodo
doodododo do
doodododo doodod
oh I want something just like this
doodododo doodo
doodododo do
doodododo doodod

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a topping
that's too exotic or flash
just something simple
that tastes good with a
crust that I can bite into
something I can relish
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
