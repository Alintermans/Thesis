[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go consent of the
masses I don't know why they'd choose
it on a pie it's an abuse
of the culinary arts they
claim it's tasty but it
clashes with the other toppings and
ruins the whole thing a
nchovies and pineapple don't mix
it's a sacrilege to pizza
purity my taste buds do protest
pineapple on pizza is the worst
I'd rather have plain cheese on
toast than pineapple on my fe
stive pizza I was born

[Pre-Chorus]
no way no
way no way no

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza I won't bow to this trendy
fad it's a disgrace to the pizza legacy
offer me a slice with sense
good god let me keep my preference
keep pineapple
off my pizza I won't bow to this trendy
fad it's a disgrace to the pizza legacy
offer me a slice with sense
good god let me keep my preference

[Verse 2]
if I'm a fan of the classic slice
pineapple's not nice it
doesn't belong on a pizza
it's a travesty of taste
banish it to a distant island
or a trash can it's a waste of
a good crust and sauce and cheese
it's a monstrosity we
need to take a stand and say no
to this outrageous addition
pizza is sacred

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza I won't bow to this trendy
fad it's a disgrace to the pizza legacy
offer me a slice with sense
good god let me keep my preference
keep pineapple
off my pizza I won't bow to this trendy
fad it's a disgrace to the pizza legacy
offer me a slice with sense
good god let me keep my preference

[Bridge]
no pineapple allowed when the feast begins none
is worthy of a spot on my pizza heavenly scene
only then can I truly enjoy my pizza
only then can I truly taste the purity of

[Pre-Chorus]
no way no way
no way no way

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza I won't bow to this trendy
fad it's a disgrace to the pizza legacy
offer me a slice with sense
good god let me keep my preference
keep pineapple
off my pizza I won't bow to this trendy
fad it's a disgrace to the pizza legacy
offer me a slice with sense
good god let me keep my preference
