[Intro]
pineapple on pizza pie oh say is

[Verse 1]
once the box was opened wide
cheese and sauce mixed with pineapple
taste and smell together coll
your stomach turns and

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three bites later ickiness abound
you see the slice and cringe at the sight of pineapple chunks on
your taste buds scream in protest as you try to swallow it down
you search for water or soda to wash it all away baby

[Chorus]
was it over when you took the first bite oh
was it over when you realized the mistake
you forced a smile and swallowed it
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
oh say is it really

[Verse 2]
when you saw the texture gross
the slimy chunks of pine
your new slice is without it
a classic pepperon

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the look of disgust
at least I had the decency
to keep my pineapple off
only rumors of my love for pine
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about jumpin
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come runnin
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred awkward pizza nights later
if they got pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably hate her icks
you dream of a slice without pineapple before it called you a
lying traitor you search in every pizza place for something

[Chorus]
was it over when you took the first bite oh
was it over when you realized the mistake
you forced a smile and swallowed it
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
oh say
is it really on a
pizza
no no no no

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
the look of disgust
at least I had the decency
to keep my pineapple off
only rumors of my love for pine
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about jumpin
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come runnin' runnin
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Outro]
oh say is it really
on a pizza pie no no no no no no no no no no
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout
pizzas later oh I was
hoping you'd be there and
say the
one thing I've been wanting but no no no no no
