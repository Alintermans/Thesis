[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue and mad
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just shouldn't be

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a parody verse
to tell you why it's such a
faux pas to put pineapple
on a pizza you adore it
but I'm here to set it straight for
you and others like you who
don't know any better yet don't say it
isn't true it's just a fact that it's a
travesty on a pizza pie don't you see it too yeah you do
and I know you'll come around
to my way of thinking soon
cause it's just not right to put pineapple on pizza
it's a crime against the foodie

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue and
mad wish I could explain it clearer but it just shouldn
't be true mmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmh
mmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmm

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask me to add
pineapple to your pizza slice oh
I hang up the phone and shake my head in dis
gust you just don't know any better
you don't understand the
harm it does to pizza lovers
you're ruining a classic dish
it's just not worth the risk don

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about pineapple on the net
never told anyone it's great on a
pizza pie I keep it real I don't pretend
that it's a topping that belongs on a pie
it's just not right it's a shameful sight to
see it on a pizza pie it's a
travesty a disgrace to pizza lovers all around the
world it's just not done it's a faux pas a sin so don
't you dare put pineapple on a pizza pie again no
way no how it's just not right it's a crime it

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just leave my pizza alone yeah leave it
al
one leave
it
alone
leave it
