[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple a treat
on your pizza pie so sweet and neatly meted out in
slivers that look like they could never beat
the classic toppings that have long
reigned supreme in our hearts for so long
have you no taste for the tried and true ways of the past
or are you just trying to make
a statement with that
fruit on your pizza that just doesn't belong there at all and
makes me cringe every time I see it staring

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want to know if you agree or not with
my stance on pineapple on pizza and if you don
t then I'm sad to leave this debate unresolved

do I want to know if you agree or not with

should find someone who shares your love
for that sweet and tangy fruit
on their pizza and
let me enjoy mine

[Outro]
do I want to know if you agree or not with
my stance on pineapple on pizza and if you don
t then I'm sad to leave this debate unresolved
but baby we both know that pizza is sacred and
do I want to know if you'll ever change your mind and
let me show you the error of your ways and how much
better pizza can be without that sweet fruit ruining
