[Verse]
emerging from my denial and I've been doing
just fine without pineapple on my pizza pie
started out a classic way but then it went awry ol
lah lah lah lah lah lah lah
now I'm lying awake with a stomach full of
regret and a slice that tasted like a big ol
mistake that I'll never make again and I'm sigh
ing as I realize it

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're enjoying their slice
she's taking a bite and
let me pass
it's leaving a bad taste and I just can
't look away as they

[Chorus]
disrespect tradition and ruin the
harmony of a classic
drowning in disappointment
but it's the price I pay for
trying something new and
regretting it instantly
'cause I'm mr brightside

[Guitar Solo]
