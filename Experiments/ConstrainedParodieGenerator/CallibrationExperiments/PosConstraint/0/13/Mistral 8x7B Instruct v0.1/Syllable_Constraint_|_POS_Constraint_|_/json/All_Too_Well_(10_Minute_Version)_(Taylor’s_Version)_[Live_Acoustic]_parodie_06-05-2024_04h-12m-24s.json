your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nI love you guys so much [/INST]\nParody:\n[Verse 1]\nI took a bite of that pie with pineapple\nmy taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow\nand I left my appetite at the table\nthat monstrosity should not be allowed now\n\n[Verse 2]\noh that sweet and savory clash of flavors so wrong\nthe ham and pineapple duet in my mouth\nautumn leaves of disappointment falling down like\na bad dream after which I woke up with a\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I know it's long gone and\nthat culinary sin is\na blight on my tongue forevermore oh oh oh\nit's a crime\n\n[Chorus]\ncause there it was again on that slice of hell\na tropical disaster that should be in jail wind in hair\nI remember it all too\nwell and there it was again on\n\n[Verse 3]\ncheese and tomato sauce can't hide the crime scene photo\nof pineapple chunks scattered on the pizza floor oh god no please no\nand you were tossing me a slice with a grin so wide saying\nthis is the best pizza ever trust me I promise\nbut I could see the twinkle in your eye betraying the truth\nthat you knew it was a monstrosity but you\njust couldn't resist the temptation to inflict it\non an innocent soul like me who just wanted some good\nfood to eat but instead was served\na crime against nature and humanity\nand I was thinking on the\ndrive home how could anyone do such a thing and then you\nwondered where it went wrong as I ran to the bathroom\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I know it's long gone and\nthere was nothing else I could do\nand I forget about it long enough\nto forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\ncause there it was again in the middle of the\nnight we were feasting on the pizza of doom dancing around\nthe kitchen in the flu\norescent light down the stairs it\nwas a nightmare I remember it all too well and\nthere it was again when nobody had to know you kept\nme like a secret but\nI kept my dignity intact and\n\n[Bridge]\nwell maybe we got lost in translation\nmaybe I asked for too much\nbut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\ntil you added pine\napple to it running\nscared I was there I remember\nit all too well and you call me up again just to remind\nme of the culinary atrocity you inflicted\non me so casually cruel in the name\nof experimentation a\n\n[Verse 4]\ntime won't fly it's like I'm\nparalyzed by the memory of that\ndisaster I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying\nto erase it from my mind\nafter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me\nyour own now you mail back my leftovers and I throw them away but you\nkeep my old number on speed dial\nreminding me of the culinary\nsin you committed\nyou can't undo it you can't erase\nit from my memory I remember it all\ntoo well and you call me up again just to remind me of the\npain you caused me so casually cruel in\n\n[Verse 5]\ntime won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by the\nmemory of that disaster I'd like to be my old self again\nbut I'm still trying to erase it from my mind cheese\nand tomato sauce can't hide the taste of shame\nand did the pineapple chunks ruin the pizza\nfor you too did they leave a bitter taste in your mouth\njust between us did the love\naffair with pineapple maim you too\n\n[Chorus]\ncause there it was again on that slice of\nhell a tropical disaster that should be in jail\nwind in my hair I was\nthere I remember it all too\nwell and there it was again\non that pizza of do\nom I remember it\nall too well and there it\nwas again on that slice\nof shame I remember it all\n\n[Verse 6]\nand I was never good at hiding my disgust but the punch\nline goes pineapple doesn't belong on a\npizza you know it's true just between us\ndid the love affair with pineapple maim you\nall too well just between us do you\nremember it all too well just between us it\nwas a crime against nature\nand humanity and I remember\nit all too well and I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\njust between us did the love affair with pineapple ma\nim you all too well
