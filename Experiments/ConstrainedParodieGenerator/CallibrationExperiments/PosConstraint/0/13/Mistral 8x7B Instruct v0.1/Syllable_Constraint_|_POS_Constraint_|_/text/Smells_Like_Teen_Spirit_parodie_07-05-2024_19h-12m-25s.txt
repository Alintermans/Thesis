[Verse 1]
grab some dough, and call
your friends to stand and brawllefto
verses of pineapple's fallfrom grace on
pizza's face is a disgrace to

[Pre-Chorus]
oh noh noh noh noh noh noh no
oh noh noh noh noh noh noh no
oh noh noh noh noh noh noh no
oh noh noh noh noh no

[Chorus]
with the taste obscured it's less absurd
here we are now giving it a
hard refusal to put pine on
pizza's altar we say no way
an abomination a dis
gusting addition to our

[Post-Chorus]
way noh no

[Verse 2]
their taste is skewed they can't
see the error of their ways
our little group has always known
it's wrong to put it on display

[Pre-Chorus]
oh noh noh noh noh noh noh no
oh noh noh noh noh noh noh no
oh noh noh noh noh noh noh no
oh noh noh noh noh no

[Chorus]
with the taste obscured it's less absurd
here we are now giving it a
hard refusal to put pine on
pizza's altar we say no way
an abomination a dis
gusting addition to our

[Post-Chorus]
way noh no

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I tried
that slice before it's bitter taste
I found it hard to comprehend
why anyone would put it there

[Pre-Chorus]
oh noh noh noh noh noh noh no
oh noh noh noh noh noh noh no
oh noh noh noh noh noh noh no
oh noh noh noh noh no

[Chorus]
with the taste obscured it's less absurd
here we are now giving it a
hard refusal to put pine on
pizza's altar we say no way
an abomination a dis
gusting addition to our

[Outro]
a delusion a denial
a delusion a denial
a delusion a denial
a delusion a denial
a delusion
