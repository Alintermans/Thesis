[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for it do ya barn
it goes like this the dough the sauce
the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the tangy pineapple takes its turn and

[Chorus]
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again

[Verse 2]
your taste was bland but you sought delight
you tried it on a pizza night
but the sweetness clashed with the marinara
it tasted strange and looked quite odd
it ruined the pizza god forbid
and left you with a bitter taste of sorrow

[Chorus]
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again

[Verse 3]
you say it's just a fruit on bread
but I beg to disagree with
what you've done to this classic dish instead sir
the flavors clash and the texture's wrong
it doesn't belong on pizza
it's a disgrace and a broken promise land

[Chorus]
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again

[Verse 4]
I tried it once but I won't
repeat that mistake again I won
t let pineapple ruin pizza for me
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the pizza gods
with nothing on my plate but pepperoni

[Chorus]
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again
hallelujah hallelujah
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again
hallelujah hallelujah
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
oh no not again oh no not

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this pizza I've adored
I used to eat it alone before I knew
you but now I'll never share a slice with
pineapple again I'll never
let it ruin pizza for me again hallel

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I tried it new
the taste was strange and not for me
and every bite I took was a broken o

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from love
is how to say no to pineapple on top
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
