[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice foot
now in the morning I take a bite
of a pizza that just ain

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to love the taste
but now it's ruined by the pineap
stuck in every bite like
a thorn in my side I can't escape
one bite in and I feel bet
the sweetness turned to regret
and I discovered that my crust is soft
upon a base of disrespectful loathing

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
the choir of pizza lovers sing
be my savior from this bitter
taste that's ruining my pizza dinner
for some reason I can't explain
once I tasted it there was
never a moment of
pure pizza enjoyment again

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a sweet and savory
dream until the pineapple came
shattered expectations and the sound
of disappointment filled the room with shame
revolutionaries wait
for the pineapple to abate
just a travesty on a once loved plate aw
who would ever want pineapple on

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
the choir of pizza lovers sing
be my savior from this bitter
taste that's ruining my pizza dinner
for some reason I can't explain
I know the pizza gods won't look kind
on this monstrosity
that was once a delicious meal

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
hear the bells of disappointment ring
oh no oh no oh no
the choir of pizza lovers sing
oh no oh no oh no
be my savior from this bitter
taste that's ruining the
pizza experience for me and mine
oh no oh no oh no
I know the pizza gods won't look
kind on this monstrosit
y that was once a delicious meal outh
