[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie
it's a crime against humanity
don't make me lose my mind please don
it's like a joke that's not funny
sweet and juicy but not on a
pizza should be savored
not turned into a messy disgra
a slice of heaven but
not with fruit on top please don't make
me vomit with delight nope no
pineapple on a pizza is a
disaster waiting to happen no
no matter how you slice it
it's just not worth the risk of a
life of regret and shame

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no no
amen amen

[Chorus]
don't take me
to the pizza place where they put pineapple on
the pie it's a crime against flavor and grace don
tell me I'm wrong but I know
I'll worship at the altar of che
and pepperon
not pineapple no way no how no when no where
I'll give you my life but not my pizza prefer
ences and toppings but not
that fruit that's just not right no matter

[Verse 2]
I know some folks might say it's okay
but they're just not in the
know when it comes to pineapple
on a pizza it's a deal
breaker not a maker no way no
savor the flavors of the sau
cheese and the crust but not that
fruit it's just not worth the risk
of a life of disappointment
and disgust no matter how you
slice it it's just not

[Chorus]
don't take me
to the pizza place where they put pineapple on
the pie it's a crime against flavor and grace don
tell me I'm wrong but I know
I'll worship at the altar of che
and pepperon
not pineapple no way no how no when no where
I'll give you my life but not my pizza prefer
ences and toppings but not
that fruit that's just not right no matter

[Bridge]
I know some might say it's a trendy topping but
I'll stick to the classics thank you very much no way no
I'll take a pass on the fruit and go for the meat
of the pizza that's where it's at no matter how you

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no no no
amen amen

[Chorus]
don't take me
to the pizza place where they put pineapple on
the pie it's a crime against flavor and grace don
tell me I'm wrong but I know
I'll worship at the altar of che
and pepperon
not pineapple no way no how no when no where
I'll give you my life but not my pizza prefer
ences and toppings but not
that fruit that's just not right no matter
