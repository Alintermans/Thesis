[Intro]
I think I'm glad I never put a
pineapple on my pizza to
it's just not the topping for me you
see I've got a problem with
the sweetness

[Verse]
it's like a tropical parad
inexcusable on a pie that's savory and dark
pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza it's like a crime in the making of
a culinary disaster
and I can't abide by the thought of it being to
top my mozzarella and pepperon
it's like a sin to even consider it a pineapple
on my pizza no way no how
I'll stick to the classic toppings thank you very much so
don't even get me started on
the hawaiian pizza travesty that's been
going around for far too long
I'll take a pass on that one too thank you very much so
pineapple on my pizza no way no
how about you just stick to the basics and keep it simple

[Chorus]
pineapple on the
pizza no way no
pineapple on the pizza
no way no how no
pineapple on the pizza
no way no how no

[Outro]
so there you have it
my pineapple stance is
clear and strong and unwa
changing anytime soon so don
enjo
