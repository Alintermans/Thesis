[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to put pineapp
on my pizza and I thought it
was a tasty treat for my taste bud
but now I see the error

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to think it was
a tropical twist on a classic
but now I see the truth is
it's a pineapple abomination
I can't believe I used
to put it on my pizza
now I see the error of my ways and
I'll never do it again forevermore

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells are ringin' in dis
roman cavalry choirs are singin
be my mirror my sword and shield
my pizza without pineapple is real
never an honest word will I speak
and that was when I ruled the
world of pizza without
pineapple toppings forever

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild wind
that blew away my pineapple
dreams of a pizza paradise lost
forever in the past tense now I see
the truth is clear to me now
pineapple doesn't belong on
pizza it's a crime against culinary
justice and a sin against the lord

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells are ringin' in dis
roman cavalry choirs are singin
be my mirror my sword and shield
my pizza without pineapple is real
never an honest word will I speak
and that was when I ruled the world of no
pineapple on pizza
forevermore and evermore

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
jerusalem bells are
roman cavalry choirs are singin
be my mirror my sword
my pizza without pineapple is
real and true and pure and
never an honest word will I
speak and that was when I
ruled the world of no pineapple on top
forevermore and et
evermore and evermore and ev
er more and evermore
