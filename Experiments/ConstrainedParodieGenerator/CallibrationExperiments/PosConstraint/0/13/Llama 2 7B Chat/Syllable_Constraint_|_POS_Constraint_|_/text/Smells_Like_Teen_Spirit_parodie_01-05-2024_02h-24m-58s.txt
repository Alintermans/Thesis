[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against human dec
don't put it on a pieza please don
it's just not worth the price to pay

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pineapple oh how low
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how

[Chorus]
with the cheese and sauce so bright and bold
it's a pizza that's worth gold and
I feel hungry and excited
it's a pizza that's worth the cost
a tomato a pepper a
a mushroom a treat to see food

[Post-Chorus]
yeah hey ya

[Verse 2]
but pineapple on a pie
it's just not worth the try to
it's a flavor that don't mix well
and it's a texture that don't

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pineapple oh how low
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how

[Chorus]
with the cheese and sauce so bright and bold
it's a pizza that's worth gold and
I feel hungry and excited
it's a pizza that's worth the cost
a tomato a pepper a
a mushroom a treat to see food

[Post-Chorus]
yeah hey ya

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
so let's all agree to disag
pineapple on a pizza is
just not for me to see or be
it's a taste that don't belong

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pineapple oh how low
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how

[Chorus]
with the cheese and sauce so bright and bold
it's a pizza that's worth gold and
I feel hungry and excited
it's a pizza that's worth the cost
a tomato a pepper a
a mushroom a treat to see food
