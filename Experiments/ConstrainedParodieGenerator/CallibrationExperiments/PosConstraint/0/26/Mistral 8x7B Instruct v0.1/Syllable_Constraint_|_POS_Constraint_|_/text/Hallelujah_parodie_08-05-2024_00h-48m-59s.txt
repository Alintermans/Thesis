[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for that do ya pov
it goes like this the dough the sauce
the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the baffling sight of pineapple shows

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 2]
your taste was fine but you needed proof
this combo's not a truth or proof
it tastes like sweet and sour and it over
throws your palate with its strange all
ure it's different but not in a
good way it just doesn't belong there hallel

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 3]
you say it's fine but it's not the
same as ham and pepperoni
but if you did try it you would see it's not
for you it's a mistake and an error
there's a taste of failure in each
bite it's a pineapple pizza disaster

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 4]
I tried it once it was a test
I couldn't stomach it I confess
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though I gave it a
chance it just wasn't meant to be
I'll stick to pepperoni hallelujah

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Outro]
pineapple no no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I've walked this floor
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pineapple on the mar
garita glass but love is not
a victory march it's a cold and it's a bro

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I tasted you
the holy taste was moving too
but now it's just a cold and broken pizza pie

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a taste above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot down someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken pizza pie taste
