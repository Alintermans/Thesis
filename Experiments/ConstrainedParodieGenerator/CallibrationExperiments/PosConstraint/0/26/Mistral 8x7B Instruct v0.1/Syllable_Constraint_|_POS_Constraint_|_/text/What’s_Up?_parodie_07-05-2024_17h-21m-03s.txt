[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I realized quickly when I took a bite
that pineapple's a culprit that just doesn't fit right
for the taste that I ate

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just thinking of the taste that I once led
and I'm feeling a little peculiaristic
and so I wake in the morning and I open wide
and I take a deep breath and I swallow with
and I spit from the top of my
mouth saying oh

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on with
my pizza pie today
and I say
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh oh oh
oh oh
oh
oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
and I tried
oh my gosh did I
I tried every
topping variety
and I cried
oh my gosh did I cried
I cried every single day
for a replacement

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just thinking of the taste that I once led
and I'm feeling a little peculiaristic
and so I wake in the morning and I open wide
and I take a deep breath and I swallow with
and I spit from the top of my mouth
saying oh no

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on
with my pizza pie hey
and I say
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
and I say hey hey hey
wake in the morning and open wide
take a deep
and I spit from the top of my mouth
saying oh
and I say hey hey hey hey hey
wake in the morning and
open wide take a deep and I spe
it from the top of
my mouth saying oh no no no no
and I say
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh oh oh

[Outro]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion
on my pizza slice fate fare
