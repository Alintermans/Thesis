[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottles in hand looking so divine start
it started out with a slice now my stomach is in a
wad of regret and disappointment in my heart
now I'm lying awake and my stomach's in a
tizzy as I think of pineapple on pizza
it's a travesty and it's just not right or fair
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savoring the taste
while I'm stuck in my ways
let me be
for I cannot bear to see it on a
pizza pie and it

[Chorus]
sparks controversy and turns friends into
frenemies swimming through a
minefield of opinions but
it's just the price we pay for
freedom of choice calling me
open up my curious
eyes for I am not

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine must
ard to accept that some people have different
tastes and that's okay but it's just not for me it started
out as a joke but now I'm feeling quite morose
now I'm lying awake and my stomach's in a
tizzy as I think of pineapple on pizza
it's a travesty and it's just not right or fair
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savoring the taste
while I'm stuck in my ways
let me be
for I cannot bear to see it on
a pizza pie and

[Chorus]
sparks controversy and turns friends into
frenemies swimming through a
minefield of opinions but
it's just the price we pay for
freedom of choice calling me
open up my curious
eyes for I am not

[Guitar Solo]


[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never
