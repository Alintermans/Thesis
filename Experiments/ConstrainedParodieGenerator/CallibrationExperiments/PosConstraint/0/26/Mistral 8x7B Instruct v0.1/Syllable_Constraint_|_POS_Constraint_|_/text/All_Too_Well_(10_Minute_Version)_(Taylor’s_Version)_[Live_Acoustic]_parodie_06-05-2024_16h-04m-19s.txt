[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my appetite at the table
that monstrosity should not be allowed now

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet deception and my misguided taste bud
we're arguing in the kitchen like two fool
hammered by the taste of this culinary fraud
and I can't believe it after all these

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's a mistake
but I took another bite
and I'm not satisfied at all now oh oh oh
chorus c

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on my pizza slice sheet
pineapple chunks staring back like a cheat wind In my hair I
was there I remember it
all too well and never again

[Verse 3]
toppings scattered on the counter like a joke played on me
you said it would be great but you lied to me and my family tree
and I was hoping for a feast but I ended up in hell
and I'm still wondering where it went wrong and why it
didn't work out so well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
pre chorus ouse ouldn't
taste it again and I regret it all now oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's a mistake
but I took another bite and
I'm not satisfied at all now oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on my pizza slice sheet pine
apple chunks staring back like a cheat wind in my hair I was
there I remember it
all too well and never again
down the stairs I was there I
remember it all too well and never again oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you tore it all up
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to disappoint me like a
promise so casually cruel in the name of being
honest I'm a crumpled up piece of paper now
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time I think of pineapple
you said if we had been closer in taste maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of pizza who was
it a never needing extra topping jewel whose shine reflects on you
not weeping in a party bathroom
some customer asking me what happened
you that's what happened
you who charmed my taste buds with
extra cheese and pepperoni like a late night
show but then I watched you add pineapple and I knew it was a
mistake oh I remember it all too well oh oh oh

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you send back my leftovers and I
eat alone but you keep my old scarf from that first
time we ate together it reminds you of innoc
ence and it smells like pizza
you can't get rid of it cause you

[Chorus]
remember it all too well yeah oh oh
down the stairs I was there I remember it all too
well and never again
wind in my hair I was there oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at hiding my disappointment but
the punch line goes pineapple doesn't belong
on pizza you said it would be great but
you lied to me and my taste buds are still in
shock and did the pineapple ruin
the pizza for you too well it did for me too
'cause in this city's pizza shops
I still remember the first slice I had
and how it tasted as it hit
my tongue I remember it all

[Outro]
just between us I remember it all too well oh oh
down the stairs I was there I remember it all too
well and never again oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
