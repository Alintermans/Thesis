[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we
must face the truth known so well to
connoisseurs of pizza flavor beyond compare
you might think it looks fine there
but it ain't really right

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we've tasted before
why do we keep adding pineapple to
the mixup the mixup
we never learn we've tasted before
why do we keep adding pineapple to
the mixup the mixup

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
put down that pineapple slice it's a sign
we should leave it behind in the
grocery aisle we gotta get

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice with regret on
it's a slippery slope we
slide down with each bite taken
remember the joy of pure pizza taste
we can find it again out
there in the pizza place far

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we've tasted before
why do we keep adding pineapple to
the mixup the mixup
we never learn we've tasted before
why do we keep adding pineapple to
the mixup the mixup

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
put down that pineapple slice it's a sign we
should leave it behind in the store
we gotta get away from this

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we've tasted before
why do we keep adding pineapple to
the mixup the mixup
we never learn we've tasted before
why do we keep adding pineapple to
the mixup the mixup

[Bridge]
we don't add enough
of the classic to
ppizza let's not ruin
what we hold so dear
we've been here before
with pineapple fear

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on no
we gotta get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to away yeah away
we got to away yeah away
we got to away yeah away
