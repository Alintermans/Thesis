[Intro]
pineapple on pizza pie oh say is

[Verse 1]
once the box was opened wide
cheese and sauce mixed with pineapple
taste and flavor took a dive
your hunger still not

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later I see
your plate with disappointment and dismay upon your face so
you dream of my pizza before it ruined your tastebud
you search for a slice that's better baby believe me it's not good

[Chorus]
was it over when you took your first bite oh
was it over when you spit it out
I said never put pineapple
on a pizza without a doubt
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
pineapple on pizza

[Verse 2]
when you lost your appetite
red sauce white cheese combo
blue food coloring on top
your new slice is just a

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the texture slimy
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza simple
only rumors about my pizza
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred awkward pizza parties where
they serve pineapple pizza and I swear I won't be there no way no
you dream of my pizza before it ruined your tastebuds oh
you search for a slice that's better baby believe me it's not good

[Chorus]
was it over when you took your first bite oh
was it over when you spit it out I said
never put pineapple on a
pizza without a doubt it's just not
worth it then and is it over now no way

[Post-Chorus]
pineap
pineapple on pizza
pine
pineapple on

[Bridge]
did you think I didn'
pineapple on a
no way no how no pineapple
on pizza no no no no
never put pineapple on
pizza no no no
never put pineapple on a
pizza no no no no no
no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no

[Outro]
pineapple on pizza
pineapple on pizza no no no no no no no no no
pineapple on pizza no no no no
pineapple on pizza no
pineapple on pizza
no no
pineapple on pizza no no no no no no
