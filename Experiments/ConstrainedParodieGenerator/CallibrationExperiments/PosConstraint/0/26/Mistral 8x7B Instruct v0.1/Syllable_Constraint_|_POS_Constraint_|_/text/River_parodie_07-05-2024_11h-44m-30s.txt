[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need some truth serum feeling it work its primetime
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with a slice of pineapple
on his pizza plate causing a
sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched on
his breath's the smell of pineapple and ham he can
taste the sweetness of the pineapple on his tongue
but he just can't understand why it
doesn't belong on his pizza he's just begun to see
the error of his ways but it's hard to break the cycle of bad taste
on his plate is a mistake
and he just wants to scrape it off and replace it with some
pepperoni or sausage instead of this ab
omination on his pizza plate he's gotta escape
from this pineapple prison he
can't take it anymore it's time to take a stand
and say no to pineapple on his pizza grand slammy jammy
slam it in the trash and start over again
with a fresh slice of pizza with no pine

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need some truth serum feeling it work its primetime
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand it
was come morning time scram now we hug tight and then
he found out she put pineapple on his slice
it was a mistake but she just wanted to
try something new but now he's feeling used and abused
he can't believe she would do such a thing to his
beloved pizza he thought they had something special but now
he's not so sure he wants to be with someone who would put pineapple on
his pizza he can't trust her anymore he's had enough of her
games and her tricks he's moving on to a
pizza that's worthy of his love and affection he
deserves better he deserves a pizza without pineapple
on it he's not gonna settle for less he
knows what he wants and he's not gonna stop
until he finds it he's gonna keep
searching until he finds the perfect pizza no
pineapple allowed he's not gonna rest
until he finds it he
knows it's out there somewhere he just has to keep
looking he's not gonna give up he's gonna keep searching till
he

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need some truth serum feeling it work its primetime
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain

so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if life was a pizza
and pineapple was an option I'd be passing it up
speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice maybe
that's why I may have tried it once or twice
but I quickly realized it
was a mistake it's not meant to be on
my pizza I can't keep pretending it is
I can't keep lying to myself and to
my pizza I can't keep living
this lie it's time to come clean and admit the
truth I don't like pineapple on my pie

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need some truth serum feeling it work its primetime
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
I fucked up
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
