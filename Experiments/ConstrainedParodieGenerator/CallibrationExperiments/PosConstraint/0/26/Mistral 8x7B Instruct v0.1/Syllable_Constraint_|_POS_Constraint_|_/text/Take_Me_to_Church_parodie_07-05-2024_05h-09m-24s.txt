[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go ical error
pineapple should not be there I warn
her ordered extra cheese instead
if the pizza ever did speak
she's the last true master
every bite's gettin
more regrettable a
fresh embarrassment each bite we take
we were born with taste buds not for
that sweet and sour mix up on a
slice she says just pick it off before
you take a bite and ruin
your pizza experience for
no pineapple should be

[Pre-Chorus]
a pity
pity pity

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie I implore you all today
don't add it to the mix and ruin the taste
offer me a better choice
good grief let me enjoy my slice sans
pineapple keep
pineapple off my pizza pie I implore you
don't add it to the mix and ruin the taste
offer me a better choice
good grief let me enjoy my slice sans

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the classic
pepperoni slice she
demands a change of mindset we
try new toppings every
time we order in a bold attempt
to find a new favorite that
satisfies our hunger
what we got in the box is
not what we desired at all
this is disappointing work put
pineapple back where

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie I implore you all today
don't add it to the mix and ruin the taste
offer me a better choice
good grief let me enjoy my slice sans
pineapple keep
pineapple off my pizza pie I implore you
don't add it to the mix and ruin the taste
offer me a better choice
good grief let me enjoy my slice sans

[Bridge]
no pineapple or ham when the order's
placed there is no sweeter innocence than our simple
cheese and tomato base only then we truly
taste the joy of pizza only then our taste bud

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh pity
pity pity

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie I implore you all today
don't add it to the mix and ruin the taste
offer me a better choice
good grief let me enjoy my slice sans
pineapple keep
pineapple off my pizza pie I implore you
don't add it to the mix and ruin the taste
offer me a better choice
good grief let me enjoy my slice sans
