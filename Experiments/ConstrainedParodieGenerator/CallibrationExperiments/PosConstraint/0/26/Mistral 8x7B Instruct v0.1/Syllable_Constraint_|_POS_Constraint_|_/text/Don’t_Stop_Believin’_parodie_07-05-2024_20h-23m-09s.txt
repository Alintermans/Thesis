[Verse 1]
just a small town slice' in a cheesy
world it's been adulterated with pineap
just a classic pie born and raised in italy
should stick to its roots without any frilly

[Verse 2]
a chef in a steamy kitchen
the smell of dough and marin sauce
for a bite they can share the joy
it goes against the grain and against

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
waiting on the avenue
their slices yearning for pure taste
pizza people
livin' for the true essence of
tomato and mozzare

[Verse 3]
working hard to get a taste
everybody wants a sav
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will win some will lose
some are born to sing the blues
oh the dish never ends it
goes on and on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
waiting on the avenue
their slices yearning for pure taste
pizza people
livin' for the true essence of
tomato and mozzare

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating it
keep on to that dislik
pizza people
don't stop hating it
keep on
pizza people
don't stop hating it
keep on to that dislik
pizza people
