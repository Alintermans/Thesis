[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I'm disgusted then
wish I could explain it clearer
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a protest letter
to tell the world to steer clear
do you read my rants online
or do you skip my line of sight
when you said you'd give it a chance
were you even on my side
I knew when I asked you to try it once you would
make me regret my choice anew somehow
and I'd end up more disappointed than beforehand too soon now don
't say it isn't fair you didn
't even care that you made me
so dismayed so if you really wanna know why not
just look at this parody and

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I'm disgusted
then wish I could explain it clearer I wish it wasn
't true mm mm now let me tell you why it shouldn't be true for you
it's just not meant to be on

[Verse 2]
you call me again defending your
right to put pineapple on pizza
you scared me to death but I'm wasting my breath
'cause you only listen to your fellow fans
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
'cause I'd never put pineapple on
my pizza it's

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me want to add
some other toppings just to cover the
taste of pineapple so don't waste
the time I don't have and don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up
on time but I'd have an empty line because you never
paid any mind to my taste preference so

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone yeah fuck pine
ap
ple on
top
pizza
ah ah
