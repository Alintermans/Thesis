[Intro]
is this a bad pie coming from pure deceit
pineapple on pizza making us all take a seat
look at this monstrosity served upon your
plate and plate and plate again and again it
comes and comes and comes and comes again and again it comes and
comes and comes and comes again and again it comes and comes and comes

[Verse 1]
papa just ruined a
pie with fruit that doesn't belong there at all what a shame
papa chefs should know better
than to put pineapple on a pizza
papa ooh should have known better than to
serve this mess to us today if only he
could see the error of his ways and change it back again

[Verse 2]
too late my pizza's done
tainted by the taste of pineapple and ham a dis
grace to the name of pizza everywhere
goodbye margherita and pepperoni
papa ooh can't believe this is
what my pizza has come
wish it was just a bad dream and never had

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little pile of pineapple chunks
scaramouche scaramouche won't you
take them off my pizza and replace them with something good
lightning strikes my tastebuds and shocks me to the core oh galileo galileo galileo fig
aro magnificent but this pizza is
a disaster easy come easy go will
you take the pineapple off my pizza
no we will not let you ruin this pizza
let it go let it go let it go let
it go will not let you ruin this pizza for
us anymore no no no no no no no no
oh mamma mia mamma mi
a pizza without pineapple
is the only way to go for me for me for
me no no no no no no
never never never never let pineapple ruin pizza
for me again no no no no no no no no no no no no

[Verse 4]
so you think you can ruin my pizza and get
away with it huh well think again and make it
right or you'll never hear the end
of it from me and all the other pizza lovers

[Outro]

on a pizza nothing

way the pizza goes no
