[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on pizza's scandalized cul
inary scandalizing our taste
buds' sensibilities they
must be eradicated
let's discard this monstrosity and instead
opt for classic pepper'ni
toppings only please let's not offend
our palates with this blunder again
we'll savor every

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
bite of true pizza joy
I despise pineapple

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor I once knew
in this sweet and savory farce tonight
I need some taste and always this
abomination
haunts me in my dreams and ruins every
bite I take and leaves me long
ing for the days before this
trend emerged and took over the scene
will you join me in banishing
pineapple from our fe
ast tonight and forevermore amen
stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add this sin to your slice it's
already a mistake
I despise pineapple
don't add this sin to your slice it's ally
ou're already making
I despise pineapple

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add this sin to your slice it's alrread
y a mistake I desp
ise pineapple I desp
ise pineapple I desp desp desp desp desp desp
ise pineapple I desp
ise pineapple I desp
is pineapple I desp desp desp desp
ise pineapple I desp
ise pineapple I desp
was added by mistake I desp desp desp desp
ise pineapple I desp
ise pineapple I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise pineapple
I despise pineapple
I despise pineapple
I despise pineapple
