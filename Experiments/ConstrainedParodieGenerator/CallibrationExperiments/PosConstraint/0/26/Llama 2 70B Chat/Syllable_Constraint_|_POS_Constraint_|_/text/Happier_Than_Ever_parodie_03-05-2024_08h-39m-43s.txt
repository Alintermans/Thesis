[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
makes me wanna lose my
appetite every

[Verse 1]
I try to be open minded give it a chance hear
other people rave about
the sweetness of the ham and
pineapple combination
but to me it's just a crime scene
it doesn't belong on a pie
it's like putting ketchup on
a filet mignon to me oh yeah how could you
do this to a beautiful pizza pie
you're killing me slowly with every bite taking away my app
etite and my will to live
can't you see that this is
just not right it's like a knife in my back stabbing me
repeatedly with every

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime makes me wanna lose my appetite every
single time it's like a sin it's not right it's just not right at all
it's a shame that people do

[Verse 2]
you call me a hater say that I
just don't understand the flavors
but I know what I like and what I don't
and pineapple on a pizza is a
no go for me it's like a
vegetarian eating a
steak it's just not meant to be it
goes against all my belief

[Verse 3]
I don't post about it on the internet I don
't want to start a war but when I see it
in person I can't help but speak my mind it
makes me cringe it's like nails on
a chalkboard it's a sound that I can't
unhear it's a sight that I can't
unsee it's like a punch in the gut it's a slap in the face it
hurts me deep down inside it's a violation of
everything that's good and pure in this world it's like a crime
against humanity it's a travesty

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
you took something beautiful and made
it unrecognizable
just leave me and my pizza alone yeah
just
fuckin
