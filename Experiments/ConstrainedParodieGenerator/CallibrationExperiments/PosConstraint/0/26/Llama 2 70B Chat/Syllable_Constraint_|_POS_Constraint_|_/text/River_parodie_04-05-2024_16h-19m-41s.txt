bacon and olives and grapes and kiwi and fig
and don't forget the pineapple he
thinks it's a great combination he's got a death wish he
just wants to upset the chef he's a gluten for pun

sue don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth don't take
it personal I just can't say this In person to you so I
revert to the studio like a hole
in the wall diner don't have to be reserved in
a booth I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
is irreversible I preyed on you like
it's church at the pew and now that I got
you I don't want you took advant
age in my thirst to pursue why do I do this
dirt that I do get on my soapbox and
preach my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burnin' the pineap
ple wound because now with pineapple in the womb we can't
bring
