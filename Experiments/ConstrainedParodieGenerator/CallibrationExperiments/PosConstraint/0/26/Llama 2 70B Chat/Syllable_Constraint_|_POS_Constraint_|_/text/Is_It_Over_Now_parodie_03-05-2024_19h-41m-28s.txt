[Intro]
is it wrong to put pineapple on a

[Verse 1]
pizza that's the question that
we all must answer now ia
it's a fruit that's sweet and ju
icy but does it

[Pre-Chorus]
belong on a pie that's meant to be savory oh no
let's take a closer look and see ia ia ia iah
pineapple on pizza it's a crime ia ia ia
or is it just a matter of time ia ia ia iah

[Chorus]
was it over when the toppings were laid down
was it over when the cheese was unbound iah
ia ia ia ia
ia ia ia ia iah
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 2]
when the flavors clash ia
red sauce and blue cheese iah
ia ia ia
your taste buds

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see iah
the pineapple on
your pizza it's a tragedy
iah ia ia ia
only rumors of a perfect pie
and my stomach's
sighs ia ia ia oh
lord I think about avoid
ing pizza places that do
this crime ia ia ia iah ia

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later ia
if it's got pineapple I will despise ia ia ia
you dream of my taste buds ia ia ia ia ia
you search in every pizza joint for somethin' greater ia

[Chorus]

was it over when the cheese was unbound iah
ia ia ia ia
