[Intro]
I think I've found a way to express
my feelings about pineapple
on a pizza it shouldn't be placed
it's a crime against human
ity's taste

[Verse]
I've tasted pizza with pineapp
le and I can't deny it's a sin against the sens
es it's a clash of flavors that just
don't blend it's a culinary abom
ination that should be banned from
menus all around the world it's an atrocity an
d I can't understand how people
can enjoy it it's like a personal attack on my taste
buds it's like they're trying to ru
in my life with their hawaiian pizza pie alliance
I've dug a hole for pineapple on
pizza it's a grave that's six feet deep it's where
it belongs it's where it should sleep
forever and ever amen it's where it will meet its
end it's where it will rot and decay and
disappear from the face of the earth forevermore amen

[Chorus]
in my grave pineapp
le on pizza will
rot in my grave it will de
cay in my grave it
will disappear forever
and ever amen

[Outro]
in my grave pine
apple on pizza will
rot I'll make sure it's bur
ied alive and never resur
faces
