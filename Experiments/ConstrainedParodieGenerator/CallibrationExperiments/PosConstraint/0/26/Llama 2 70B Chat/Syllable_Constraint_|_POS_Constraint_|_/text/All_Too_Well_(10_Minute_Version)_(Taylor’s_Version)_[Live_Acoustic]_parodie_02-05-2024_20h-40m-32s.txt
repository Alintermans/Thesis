[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up and declare

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my eager taste buds gazing
at the menu up on the wall with stars in
our eyes autumn leaves falling down like choices
and I can picture it all now in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that flavor's not here no more
and I might be okay but my taste buds are not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost ordered a hawaiian with ham and pineapple
but something about it felt
like a crime and you were looking

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza on the counter your stomach was
growling with anticipation you used to be a little kid with
a big appetite and a love for pepperoni and sa
usage and your mom's telling stories bout you on the
tee ball team you told me bout your cravings thinking your future
was me and you were tossing me the menu like
fuck the pineapple on pizza haters key chain on
the ground we were always skipping town and I was thinking
on the drive down any time now
he's gonna say it's love you never called it
what it was til we were dead
and gone and buried check the pulse and come back swearing it
s the same after three months in the grave and then you

[Pre-Chorus]
wondered where it went to as
I reached for you but all I felt
was shame and you held my lifeless fork and
knife and I was thinking on the

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we re dancing round the kitchen in the fridge light down
the stairs I was there and
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
ath sacred prayer and we
d swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I m a crumpled up piece of paper
lying here cause I remember

[Verse 4]
it all all all they say all s well that ends well but
I m in a new hell every time
you double cross my taste buds mind you said if we had been closer in
age maybe it would have been
fine and that made me want to die the ide a
you had of me who was she a never needy ever lovely jewel
whose shine reflects on you not weeping
in a party bathroom some actresses
asking me what happ
ened you that s what happened you you who
charmed my taste buds with self effacing jokes sipping
coffee like you re on a late night show but then he watched me watch
the front door all night willing you to come and he said it

[Verse 5]
s supposed to be fun turning twenty one time
won t fly it s like I m paralyzed by it I d like to
be my old self again but I m still trying to
find it after plaid shirt days and nights when you made
me your own now you mail back my toppings and I
walk home alone but you keep my old pizza cutter
from that very first pie cause
it reminds you of innocence and

[Chorus]
it smells like me you can t get rid of
it cause you remember it all too well yeah cause there
we are again when I
loved you so back before you lost
the one real thing you veever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it
all too well wind inmy
hair you were there you re
member it all down the stairs you

[Verse 6]
were there you remember it all too well it was rare I was
there I remember It all too well and I
was never good at telling jokes but the
punch line goes I ll get older but your to
ppings stay my age from when your hawai
ian broke my taste buds skin and bones I m a
soldier who s returning
half her weight and did the twin flame bruise paint
you blue just between us did the
love affair maim you too cause in

[Outro]
this city s barren cold I still remember the first
fall of snow and how it glistened as it fell I re
