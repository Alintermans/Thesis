[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a crime having pineapple
on a beautiful pie that's just
a perfect combination of
sauce cheese and toppings all in harmony oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness and a
unique flavor to the dish but
to me it's just a culinary abom
ination that just doesn't fit
it's like putting ketchup on a ste
ak or mayonnaise on a pizza crust no

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 3]
you may think me crazy for this
belief but I just can't help
myself pineapple on pizza is just wrong
it's like a sin or a curse or someth
ing that just can't be undone
no matter how hard you try to make it right

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 4]
I know I'm not alone
in this belief that pineapple has
no place on a pizza pie it's just not right
and if you think about it you
might just see the light and join me
in this crusade against pineapple pizza

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
so let's all join together and

[Additional Lyrics]
make a pact to keep pineap
ple from ever being on a
pizza again it's time to take a stand and
make things right and if you're still not convinced
just remember that pineapple
on pizza is an abomination and it

[Additional Lyrics]
just doesn't belong it's not a
fit it's like trying to put a
square peg in a round hole it just doesn't work
and if you think about it you'll see
that I'm right and we can all just
agree to disagree but pineapple on pi

[Additional Lyrics]
zza is just wrong it's time to
make a change and make things right so
let's all join hands and sing this song and fight for
what we know is right and never give up
the fight against pineapple on pi
zza for all our lives until we're old and gray
