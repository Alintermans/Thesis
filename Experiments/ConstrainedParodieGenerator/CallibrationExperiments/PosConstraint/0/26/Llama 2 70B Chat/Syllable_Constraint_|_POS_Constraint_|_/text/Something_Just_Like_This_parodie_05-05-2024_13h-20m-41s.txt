[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for
a long time now it's true
but there's one topping that
I just can't get through
it's the pineapple
it's just not right ia
it doesn't belong on a pie ia ia iah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go I
don't know how much more
I can take of this pineapple
it's just not what I adore
I'm not looking for
a fruit that's so sweet
I need something savory
not something that's so neat
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo dop doo dop doo dop
doo dop do
doo dop doo dop doo dop
oh I want something just like this
doo dop doo dop doo dop
doo dop doo dop do
doo dop doo dop doo dop
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
of old and new ia
the pizza toppings they
all say the same ia
no pineapple allowed
it's just not worth the risk
it's not a topping that I ia ia

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk iao
I'm not looking for a fruit iao
that's so out of place iao iao
I need something that
compliments the che
not something that iao iao iao
I want something just like

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
this doo dop doo dop doo dop
doo dop doo dop doo dop do

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo dop doo dop doo dop
doo dop doo dop do
doo dop doo dop doo dop
oh I want something just like this
doo dop doo dop doo dop
doo dop doo dop do
doo dop doo dop doo dop

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for a fruit iao
that's so out of place iao iao
I need something that
compliments the che
not something that iao iao iao
I want something just like
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
