[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
she's the pineapple at the table
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've spoken up before
if the kitchens ever did dec
she's the last true defense
every pizza night's gettin' more
a fresh controversy
we were born picky I've
heard them say it time and time ag
my oven offers no absolut
she tells me bake it in the kitchen
the only paradise is
when I'm alone with no pineap
I was born picky but

[Pre-Chorus]
a pie please
pie please pie please

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pie
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pie
oh good chef let me give you my life

[Verse 2]

my lover's the pizza
to keep the flavor on my side
she demands a compromise

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your

I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me my deathless pie
oh good chef let me give you my life

[Bridge]
no toppings or chefs when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter harmony than our gentle din
in the madness and dough of that sad kitchen scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh pie please
pie please pie please

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pie
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pie
oh good chef let me give you my life
