[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it felt like a mistake
and I left my pizza there with pineapple
and you've still got it in your fridge now looking

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet disposition and my wide eyes rolled in
we're arguing in the kitchen about this
pineapple on a pizza pie creation spin
and I can picture it after all these nights

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
this debate's not here no more
but I'm not okay and I'm not fine at
all about

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red because you were hating
on me and my pineapple
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter your disdain
was turning red as you shook your head in vain about that pineapple
and your father's telling stories about your past obsession
you told me about your past hoping it was mine too
and you were tossing me the recipe key saying let's
skip tradition and try something new but I was
thinking on the drive home any minute now the truth
would come out and you'd say it's not love it's
just a preference and then you
wondered where it went to as I reached for you
but all I felt was disgust
and you held my disgusted frame instead of love we were
dead and gone and buried beneath the weight of our

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light about this fruit on
our pizza pie and how it
ruins the taste for me but I remember it all
too well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept me like a
secret but I kept you like an o

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you ruined it all
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to argue about it all
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had agreed on this topping maybe it would have been
right but that made me want to
die the idea you had of me who was
that pineapple lover whose obsession reflected on me not weeping
in a party bathroom some stranger
asking me what happened you and your pine
apple preference
that's what happened you you who charmed my dad with
self effacing jokes sipping coffee like you're on
a late night show but then he watched me watch the front door all night long
wishing you'd come back and say it's supposed to be fun turn

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old pizza from that very first
week because it reminds you of innocence and it
smells like me you can't get
rid of it cause you remember it

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were
there you remember it
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your preferences stay
the same from when your pineapple broke the
rules and my palate bones I'm a soldier who
returns from the battlefield of taste
I'm still remembering the first slice of snow that
glistened as it fell on the
pizza pie I remember it all too
well just between us did the love
affair maim you all too well just

[Outro]
just between us do you remember it all too well just
between us I remember it all too well wind in
my hair I was there I was there down the stairs I was there I was
there sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was there
I was there down the stairs I was there I was
there sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was there
I was there down the stairs I was
there sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was there
I was there down the stairs I was
there sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was there
I was there down the stairs I was there sacred

[Spoken Outro]
I love you guys so much
