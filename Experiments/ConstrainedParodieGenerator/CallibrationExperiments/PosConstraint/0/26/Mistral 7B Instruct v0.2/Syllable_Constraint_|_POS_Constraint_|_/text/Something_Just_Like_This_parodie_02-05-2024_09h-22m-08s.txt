I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
pepperoni and its
pineapple's
topping's all amisses
but I'm not the kind of eater that it fitsisis

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said oh where d'
where do you wanna go
how much you wanna riskisis
I'm not looking for someone
with a pineapple
a exotic dish
just something I can turn to
somebody I can miss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doodoodoohoo doodo
doodoodoohoo do
doodoodoohoo doodo
oh I want something just like this
doodoodoohoo doodo
doodoodoohoo do
doodoodoohoo doodo
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this
