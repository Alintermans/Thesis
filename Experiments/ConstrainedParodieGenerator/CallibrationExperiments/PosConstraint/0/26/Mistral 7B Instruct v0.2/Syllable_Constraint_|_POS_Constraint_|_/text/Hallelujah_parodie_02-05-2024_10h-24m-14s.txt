[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that italians made and it caused a
disagreeable surprise for ya it goes like
this pineapple first then tom sauce
the sweet and sour clash and the
bitter taste of pineapple on pizza oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel

[Verse 2]
your taste was strong but you needed proof
you saw the pineapple on the
top ruining the traditional look of
it tied you to a kitchen chair
they took away the pepperoni
and from your plate they stole the hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel

[Verse 3]
you say I voiced an opinion
on a food that's just an option
but if I did why should it matter to ya
there's a harmony in every bite
it doesn't matter which you sight
the classic or the controversial hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel

[Verse 4]
I tried my best to understand
the pineapple on a pizza land
I've told the truth I didn't come to
insult you and even though it
all went wrong I'll stand before the
pizza god with nothing on my tongue but hal

[Chorus]
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel
hallelujah pizza hallel

[Outro]
hallelujah pizza hallel

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this table I've walked this
floor I used to love pizza alone before
I've seen your pineapple on the marble
countertop love is not a
victory dish it's a cold and it's a broken

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy pepperoni was
moving too and every bite we drew was hal

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to argue with someone who outcook
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
