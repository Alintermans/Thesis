[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta hide from the sun because I hate pineap
it started out on a pie so simple and fineer than
but now it's on my pizza and I just can't
now I'm fallin' asleep and they're orderin' a
while he's havin' a slice and she's savourin' a
now they're goin' to share and my taste buds reco
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's twirling her fork now
he savours each bite now
let me be
'cause I just can't look it's ruining me
and takin' control

[Chorus]
pineapple pride turning foodies into
swimmin' through tropical lies
chokin' on your excuses
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin'
open up my eager pal
'cause I'm mr bitter

[Guitar Solo]
