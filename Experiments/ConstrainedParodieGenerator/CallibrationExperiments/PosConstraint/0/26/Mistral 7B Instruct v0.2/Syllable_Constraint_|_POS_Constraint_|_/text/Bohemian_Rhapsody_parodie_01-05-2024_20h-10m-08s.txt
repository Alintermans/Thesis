[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping frenzy with no escape from reality
open your eyeswide seeing a pineapple
I'm just a poor chef I need no sympathy
because I'm easy peel easy go little high little low
any way the sauce flows doesn't really matter to me to me

[Verse 1]
papa just ordered a
pineapple on his pizza pie placed it right there in the
papa culinary dreams
but now I've gone and spoiled it all
papa ooh did not mean to cause a stir
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late for second thoughts
sends shivers down my spine with every bite aghast
goodbye savory flavors I've got to
gonna leave you all behind and face the
papa ooh any way the sauce flows
I don't wanna pine
sometimes I wish I'd never added pine at

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little round pizza top of a
pineapple lover will you do the tango tango
pineapple and cheese so very frightening me me me
topping hero topping hero topping hero magnifico magnifico magnifico magnific
but I'm just a poor chef nobody loves me
he's just a poor chef from a traditional
spare him his slice from this monstrosity
easy peel easy go will you let me go
papa bella we will not let you go
papa we will not let you go papa we will
papa we will not let you go papa we will
never never never never
let me go let me go let me
go go go go go go go go go go go go
oh mamma mia mamma
mamma mia let me go mamma mia let me go mamma
pineapple demon has a topping put aside for me for me

[Verse 4]
so you think you can slice me and dismiss my ple
so you think you can pineapple and leave me to
oh baby can't do this to me baby
just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]

ooh yeah ooh yeah
nothing really matters anyone can see
nothing really matters
nothing really matters to me
any way the sauce flows
