[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pineapple on my pie
the unwelcome guest at dinner's table
the unexpected twist in
our culinary tale
we can live like friends if we want it so ill
where you can always find me
and we'll have harmony on pizza
but in the night we'll wish this never was
we'll wish this never was

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the harmony and love
I cannot taste my favorite dish this

the sweet and savory flavors blend

accept the pineapple trend
will you come clean and set this right tonight
set this right tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]

don't top your pie with
me you're already the voice inside my head
don't top your pie with
me you're already the

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
don't top your pie with
me you're already the voice inside my head
don't top your pie with
me you're already the
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
don't top your pie with
me you're already the voice inside my head
don't top your pie with
me you're already the

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
