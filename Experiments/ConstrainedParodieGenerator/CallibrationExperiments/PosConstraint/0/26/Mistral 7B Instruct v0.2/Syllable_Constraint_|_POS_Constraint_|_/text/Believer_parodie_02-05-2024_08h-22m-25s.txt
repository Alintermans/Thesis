[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
a taste that just won't persist

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you argue with me about this trendy
topping on my pizza
I'm the one with the right to be che
the one with the right to be free

[Pre-Chorus]
I was taken by surprise one
day when someone put pineapple on
my favorite food under the
sun without a second thought to undo it for me
but my taste buds they did reco
il at the sweet and savory
combination they did not know
could ever be a part of me

[Chorus]
painless days we used to have you see
believer in the taste
pineapple on pizza shattered the
peace believer
pineapple on pizza changed the game for me
it's a mistake believer belie
pineapple on pizza brought me to
my knees believer bel

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the gods up above
pineapple on pizza
has turned our taste buds to a glove oh
our taste buds up above oh

[Pre-Chorus]
we were enjoying our
pizza night when suddenly they
brought out the pineapple slice so
bitter and strange it was hard to
choke down but we gave it a try and tried to hide it
in the sauce but it still stood out like a sore thumb in our
minds it stuck like

[Chorus]
painless days we used to have you see
believer in the taste
pineapple on pizza shattered the
peace believer
pineapple on pizza changed the game for me
it's a mistake believer belie
pineapple on pizza brought me to
my knees believer bel

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the fire and the flame
you're the face of the future
pizza without pineapple
the blood in our taste bud

[Pre-Chorus]
we were taken by surprise one day when someone put
pineapple on our pizza and we couldn't believe it
but our taste

[Chorus]
painless days we used to have you see
believer in the taste
pineapple on pizza shattered the
peace believer
pineapple on pizza changed the game for me
it's a mistake believer belie
pineapple on pizza brought me to
my knees believer bel
