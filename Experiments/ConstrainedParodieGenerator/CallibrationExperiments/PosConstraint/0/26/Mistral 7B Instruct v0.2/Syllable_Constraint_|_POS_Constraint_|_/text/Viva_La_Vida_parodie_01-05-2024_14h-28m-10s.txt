[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the pie
seas of cheese would rise when I gave
now in the morning I eat alone
sweep the table I used to

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to add the pine
feel the scorn from pizza lovers' eyes
listen as the crowd would sigh
now the old king is pineapple free here
one minute it was on the
next it's banned from my pizza
and I discovered that my pizza's base
is made of cheddar and tomato graceless

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear criticism's bells a
ringing as they criticize my choice
be my mirror reflecting truth
my reasoning in a culinary
for some reason I can't explain
once you were there it tasted
never an honest bite
and that was when I ruled the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild sauce
blew down the doors to ruin me
shattered toppings and the sound of
peppers couldn't believe what I'd become
revolutionaries wait
for my pizza with pineapple
just a topping on a lonely string mmmmh aw
who would ever wanna be the king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear criticism's bells a ringing as
they criticize my choice mmmh mmmh aw
be my mirror reflecting truth
my reasoning in a culinary
for some reason I can't explain
I know food critics won't call my name
never an honest bite
but that was when I ruled the pie

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohohohohohoh
ohohohohohoh
ohohohohohoh
ohohohohohoh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohohohohohoh
hear criticism's bells a ringing as
they criticize my choice
be my mirror reflecting truth oh
my reasoning in a
for some reason I can'texplain
I know food critics won
never an honest bite but that was when
I ruled the pie ohoh
mmmmh mmmmh mmmmh mmmmh mmmmh mmmmh mmmmh mmmmh oh
ohohohohohoh
hear criticism's bells a ringing as they
criticize my choice oh
be my mirror reflecting truth

[Outro]
