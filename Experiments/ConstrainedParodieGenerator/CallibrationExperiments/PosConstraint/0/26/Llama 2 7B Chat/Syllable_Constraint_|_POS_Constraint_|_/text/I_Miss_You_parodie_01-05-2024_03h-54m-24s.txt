[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the fruit from hawaii in
the topping that we never wanted to
the sweetness that we never
requested on our pie
it's like a vacation in every slice
but we don't want to get
lost in paradise with you and your
pineapple on top of our pizza
we'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where did it go wrong this time last
we never asked for tropical heat on
our cheese and pepperoni
it's like a summer
vacation in the middle of winter with
pineapple on top of us
we'll wish this never ends I
miss pineapple on our pizza
we'll wish this never ends I miss
pineapple on our past
we'll wish this never ends I miss pineapp
we'll wish this never

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
of our pizza don
t don't waste your time
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
of our pizza don
t don't waste your time

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
of our pizza don
t don't waste your time
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
of our pizza don
t don't waste your time
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
of our pizza don
t don't waste your time
I miss pineapple on our pizza we
miss pineapple on top
we miss pineapple on

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
