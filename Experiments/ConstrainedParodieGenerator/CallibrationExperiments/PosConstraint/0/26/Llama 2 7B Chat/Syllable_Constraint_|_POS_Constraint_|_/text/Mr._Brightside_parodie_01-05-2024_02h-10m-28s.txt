[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza should not be the crime of
gotta get it straight before I lose my mind no
it started out with a topping but now it's a crime no
it was only a pizza but now it's all the
time and again I try to explain but they just
can't seem to understand no no no no no
it's like a sin to put it on a pie no no
it's not a topping it

[Pre-Chorus]
but they keep on putting it
they keep on putting it
they keep on
and I can't stop them no no no no
it's like a game they

[Chorus]
jealousy turning pineapples into
fuel for the fire that
burns in my heart no no no
choking on the lies they tell
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is calling me
open up my eyes

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
I'm coming out of my mind and I've been doing just fine
gotta get it straight before I lose my time no
it started out with a topping but now it's a crime no
it was only a pizza but now it's all the
time and again I try to explain but they just
can't seem to understand no no no no no
it's like a sin to put it on a pie no no
it's not a topping it

[Pre-Chorus]
but they keep on putting it
they keep on putting it
they keep on
and I can't stop them no no no
it's like a game they

[Chorus]
jealousy turning pineapples into
fuel for the fire that
burns in my heart no no no
choking on the lies they tell
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is calling me
open up my eyes

[Guitar Solo]


[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never
