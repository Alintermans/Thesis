[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should not
be a topping that you would choose to
it's a flavor that just doesn't belong oh no
it's like a secret chord that
disrupts the harmony of the
dish and makes it hard to sing the hallelu

[Chorus]
hallelujah halleluj
ah hallelujah hallelu

[Verse 2]
you may think it's exotic and new
but trust me it's not for me and
you it's like a kitchen chair tied to the roof
it's not a topping that I would
ever want to see oh no no no
it's a flavor that just doesn't belong oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah halleluj
ah hallelujah hallelu

[Verse 3]
it's like a holy or broken
hallelujah but this time it
ain't no good for my taste buds oh no no
it's a flavor that just doesn't belong
oh hallelujah hallelu
no no no no no no no no no no no

[Chorus]
hallelujah halleluj
ah hallelujah hallelu

[Verse 4]
I did my best to avoid it
but pineapple on a pizza is
a topping that I just can't abide oh
no no no no no no no no
it's a flavor that just doesn't
belong oh hallelujah hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
ah hallelujah hallelu
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
hallelujah hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this pizza topping is
I used to love pepperonI and sausage
but now I can't stand the thought of it
and I've seen your flag on the mar
pizza box and it's a broken hallelu

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time when I would eat
any topping on a pizza
but now I know better than to try it with
pineapple and it's a cold and it
broken hallelujah halleuj
ah hallelujah hallelujah hallelu

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a pizza place
where they put pineapple on the
but I've never been there and I don't plan
to go there anytime soon no no no
it's not a cry that I hear at night
it's not a pizza topping that I would ever
