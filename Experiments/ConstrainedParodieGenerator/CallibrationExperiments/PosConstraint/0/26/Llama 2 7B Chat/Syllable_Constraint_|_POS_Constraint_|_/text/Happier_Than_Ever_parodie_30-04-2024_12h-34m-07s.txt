[Chorus]
don't put pine
on my pizza don't put
pineapple on my pie don't
make me want to cry don

[Verse 1]
give me a slice to savor the sweetness of the che
melted mozzare
the tang of tomato the
savory spices of pe
but pineapple no no no don
taint the perfect blend of flavors
I can't abide by the
unholy union of fruit and cheese don't you
know it's a crime against culinary
justice don't put pineapple on my pizza please don't make me
weep with sorrow and despair
do you hear me don't
you're breaking my heart with your pineapple scheme don't
put it on my pizza don't

[Chorus]
don't put pineapple on my pizza don't
put it on my pie don't make me cry don't make
me want to run and hide don't put pineapple on my pizza
please don't make me suffer

[Verse 2]
you call me a pizza lover but
you don't know the meaning of the
word you're butchering my favorite dish with
your pineapple addition you're making
me lose my appetite you
should be ashamed of yourself for
ruining my pizza with your
tropical fruit don't you

[Verse 3]
I can't believe you would do this to me you're like a
double agent of pizza destruction
topping my pie with pineapple is like a bet
against my very soul you're making me see
red don't put pineapple on
my pizza don't make me angry
don't make me livid don't put pineapple on my pie
please don't make me cry don't make me sad don't
put it on my pizza don't make me mad don't make
me want to hurl my pizza at the wall don

[Outro]
you're breaking my heart with your
pineapple scheme don't put it on
my pizza don't make me
suffer don't make me cry don't make
me
want to
rip
you out
rip you
