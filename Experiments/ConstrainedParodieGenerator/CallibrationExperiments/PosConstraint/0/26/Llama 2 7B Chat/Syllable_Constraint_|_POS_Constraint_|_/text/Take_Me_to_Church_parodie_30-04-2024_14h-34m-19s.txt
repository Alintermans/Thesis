[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie
my taste buds disagree with the crime
it's a fruit that doesn't belong on
a savory dish like pizza
it's like putting ketchup on a
steak and expecting it
to taste like a treat instead of a
mistake it's a no from
me when it comes to pineapple on
pizza don't even get me
started on the spelling of the word
pineapple should be spelled with an e

just doesn't look right to me and
besides it doesn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh oh
amen amen

[Chorus]
don't take me
to the pizza place with the pineapple on top

I'll tell you my toppings and
you can sharpen your knife but please don
don't make me

when it comes to pineapple on pizza don't
even get me started on

sacred dish that requires no
fancy toppings just give me the

[Chorus]
don't take me

don't make me
eat that sweet and sour mix it's a no from me
when it comes to pineapple on pizza don't
even get me started on
the spelling of the word it's just not

[Bridge]
I know some people might say it's a fun and exc
new twist on a classic dish but to me it's just a no
go I'll stick to my traditional toppings thank
you very much pizza is a sacred dish that should

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh oh oh
amen amen

[Chorus]
don't take me
to the pizza place with the pineapple on top
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of my taste
I'll tell you my toppings and
you can sharpen your knife but please don
don't make me
eat that sweet and sour mix it's a no from me
when it comes to pineapple on pizza don't
even get me started on
the spelling of the word it's just not
