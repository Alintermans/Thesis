[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a reason to despise the
pineapple on my pizza should not
be a crime against human
ity found

[Verse]
it's sweet and juicy and oh so
tempting but it just doesn't belong on my pie like a
fungus grows on a rotten log it
just doesn't belong on my pizza like a
fungus grows on a ro
rotten log it doesn't belong on my pizza like a
fungus grows on a rotten log it doesn
just doesn't belong on my pizza like a fungus grows on
a rotten log it doesn't fit
it's a topping for hawaiian shirts and tropical be
vacations but it doesn't belong
on my pizza like a fungus grows on a
rotten log it doesn't belong
on my pizza like a fungus grows on a rotten log
it doesn't belong on my pizza like
a fungus grows on a rotten log it doesn't belong on

[Chorus]
in my oven it
in my oven it
in my oven it will burn
in my oven it
in my oven it will burn
in my oven it

[Outro]
in my oven it
it will burn it will burn
in my oven it will
burn it will burn in my oven
it will
