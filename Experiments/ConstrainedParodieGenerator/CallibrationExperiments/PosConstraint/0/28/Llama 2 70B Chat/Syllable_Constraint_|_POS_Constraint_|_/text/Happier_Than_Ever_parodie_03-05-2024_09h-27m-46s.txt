[Chorus]
when I get a slice of
pineapple on my pizza
I feel like I've been deceived it
it makes my tastebud

[Verse 1]
take a moment to think of toppings that go well with
cheese and tomato sauce and
don't you dare tell me that
pineapple belongs on a
pizza please do tell me why you
think that it's a good idea
imma have to disagree
it ends up tasting like a tropical disgu
do you really want that on your pizza
its just not the vibe that I'm feeling its just not what I like its just
not what I prefer to eat
see pizza is my comfort
it's not the time for you to get adventurous and
add something that doesn't belong

[Chorus]
when I look at my pizza and see pineapple
I would rather not eat it at all instead of bit
ing into something that doesn't taste right its just not worth the fight
it'll leave a bad after

[Verse 2]
I recall the day you told me that
you put pineapple on your pizza
I could not believe what I was hearing such
a crime against culinary human
it took so getting used to
hearing people say that they love
pineapple on their pizza now
its being served everywhere

[Verse 3]
but it'll never make will never it'll never make
me happy to see pineapple on a
pizza no matter how hard you try I'll never
understand why people like it pineapple
on a pizza is just not my thing so
just leave it off of my pie got it
my taste buds will thank you for it having pineapple on a
pizza is just not right it's a crime against human
there're better ways to be adventurous with your food
stop trying to make pineapple on pizza

[Outro]
it does nothing compliment
complements the flavor of the che
does nothing it does nothing
why do you insist on putting it on
pine
apple
stop
request
