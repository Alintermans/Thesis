[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but somethingabout the toppings you chose
made me question our entire affair

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet desire for pepperoni and sa
what is it about those greasy slices that
drew you in like a fly to a bug zapper ah
but I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know its long gone and
that pizza is best enjoyed
with a cold beer and some wings to go with it all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little town
street you almost ran the red because you were lookin over
at the menu and I was
I was there I remember it

[Verse 3]
frito pie on the table our mouths were watering
your talking bout the toppings and I'm just nodding along pretending
to know what you're saying cause I'm a vegetarian and
I wont touch that meaty goodness with a ten foot pole
and you ordered for both of us cause I couldn't decide which
self explanatory because every knows
pizza without pineapple is the only way to
its like a sin to put it on top of that beautiful
dough its like a crime against cul
and I was thinking on the drive home any
time now hell say its love but
its really just a pizza with pineapple on top oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know its long gone and
no pizza is complete without
a little bit of ham or maybe some
bacon but never pineapple

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night reheating leftovers in the microwave because the
oven broke down and we
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept your pizza topping a secret but I found out
yeah I kept you like an
oath sacred prayer no way in hell am

[Bridge]
I'll never understand why you had to
ruin a perfectly good
piece of dough like that maybe it was a
phase maybe it was
just a cry for help but
I could never bring myself to
do that to a perfectly good pizza crust no way in hell
well maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for
too much but maybe this pizza was a master
piece until you tore it all up

[Verse 4]
running scared I was there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to
break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of
being honest I'm a to
tally ruined pizza lying here because
I remember it all all all all all all all all all all all all all
also does pineapple belong on
a potato does it belong on a
a caesar salad
I don stand it ions after looking ah
standing in line at the pizzeria with you
and something about the way you ordered that pizza made me real
ize that we could never be together again oh oh

[Verse 5]
oh your sweet desire for pepperoni and
sa what is it about those greasy slices that drew you in like a
fly to a bug zapper ah but I can picture it
after all these days and I know its long gone and
and that pizza is best enjoyed with a cold be
er and some wings to go with it all oh oh oh and
I remember it all too
well and there we are again when grew

[Chorus]
out of that pizza parlor with our
stomachs growling with anticipation and our
hearts broken from the thought
of pineapple on a pizza
wind outside we were there we
remember it I was
there I remember it
it seems so long ago
I remember it all
I was there I remember it

[Verse 6]
and I will never be at peace with the fact that you would do
such a thing to a perfectly good pizza
that's just not something I can easily
I mean there are some things in life that are just
unforgivable and putting pi
neapple on a pizza is one of them I'll never
understand how someone could
do that to a perfectly good pie oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
its like you took a beautiful

[Outro]
work of art and just threw it away like it was nothing
just because you wanted to be different just so
so you could stand out from the crowd but at what cost oh oh oh oh
pineapple on a pizza its just not
natural its like putting ketchup
on a hot dog or mayonnaise on
a pizza its just not right its just not right
oh oh oh oh I remember it all
too well I was there I remember
oh oh oh I remember it all
I was there I remember it
wind outside we were there we remember
it all too well I was there I was
there I remember it all too well
we were there I remember it
oh oh oh I remember it all too
well I was there I remember it
ii was there I remember it all
too well we were there I remember it all

[Spoken Outro]
I hope you guys never
