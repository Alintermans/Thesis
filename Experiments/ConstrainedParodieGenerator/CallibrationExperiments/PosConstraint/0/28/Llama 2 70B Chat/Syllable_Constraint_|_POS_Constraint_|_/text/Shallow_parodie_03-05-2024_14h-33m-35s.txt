[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me somethin

somethin' that you need
or is it just a nasty habit

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]

on every slice I find myself callin
out for
a taste that's not a crime against food

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]

where pineapple does not
contrast with cheese crash through their ruled ically
we'll never in the swampy

where pineapple does not
contrast with cheese crash through their ruled ically
we'll never in the swampy

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]

that's what pizza should be la la la
that's what pizza should be
my calling just with any
