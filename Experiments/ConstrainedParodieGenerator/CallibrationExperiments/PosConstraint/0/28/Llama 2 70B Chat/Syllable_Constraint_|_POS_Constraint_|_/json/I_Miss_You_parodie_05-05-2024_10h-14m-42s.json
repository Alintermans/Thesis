And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI abhor your presence\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nfountain of\nall globby and sticky sweet\nno tastegood on a pizza in sight\nan abomination oh\nin plainvision at any\nwe desire plain pizza margherita\nnot your confusing silly\nand we wonna plainview forever\nand peradventure an hour our\nour ordereded\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI avoid your presence\nyour being we cannot\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere is the pizza without you\nmy growing very increasing my was\nI oppose eucharinity\nthe gross amount ver\nver comes in with can't difference imag\nand with it climbs my rising\nevery time against that\nwill someone plz put It rightback I\nin returnforthforawhileple\nand let us partakers of\nordered pizza let us be partakers\nlet us partakers\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ngo away be gone waste no more of my time\nthe rationalize of\nmy ordered pizza voice\n\ngo away be gone waste no more of my time\nthe rationalizeof\nmy ordereded what\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ngo away be gone waste no more of my time\nthe rationaliza\nmy ordereded what\n\ngo away be gone waste no more of my time\nthe rationaliza\nmy ordereded what\n\ngo away be gone waste no more of my time\nthe rationaliza\nmy ordereded what\n\ngo away be gone waste no more of my time\nthe rationaliza\nmy ordereded what\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nmy missedordered\nmy missedordered\nmy missedordered\n",
