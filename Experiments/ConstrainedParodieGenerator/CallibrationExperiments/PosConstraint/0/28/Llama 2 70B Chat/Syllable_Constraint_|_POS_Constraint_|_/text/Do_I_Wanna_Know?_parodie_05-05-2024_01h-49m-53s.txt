[Verse 1]
have you considered the toppings
that should never be on a pizzacrust it sticks out like
a sore thumb like pineapple on a pie
does it really belong there can
be no dispute it's a travesty in
your mouth are there flavors that just don't belong there
do you ever question your taste
like a pizza with
no cheese that's just a waste every night this week I've been dream
about the perfect slice how many toppings can

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want pineapple on my pizza dovet
isn't it clear that it just doesn't fit somehow it
just doesn't feel right no matter how long I think
about it pineapple doesn't belong on a pie

[Chorus]
returning to the
way pizza should be without
pineapple that
just confuses
maybe I can
redouble efforts
to avoid that route more
more pizza returned
to how it should be

[Verse 2]
so have we forgotten
fitting choices for a pizza topping
and if so what are where can we people who
put pineapple on a pizza what time will they realize
it doesn't it doesn't belong every time I order

return back etc back to the
way pizza should be without
pineapple that just confuse
maybe I can redouble efforts
to avoid that route more more pizza ret
urn thrive to how it should be way
it should be way it should be
more pizza returned
to how it should be

[Outro]
is it hoping for too much that pineapple will
never again grace the surface of a pie do we
really need to call and order pizza with the
understanding that pineapple needs to stay away
is it searching for the answer to questions that don
eed not be asked do pizza purveyors really need
be told that pineapple has no place on their creation
