He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a fool regarding a\npineapple on a pizza\na heinous act that's plain to see it doesn't belong near me\nwhen will people learn that it's a sin to combine them with\non a beautiful pie full of\npepperoni or me thinks it's time for a change\nso let the improvement\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe enters the pizza parlor with a cra\ncheshed up menu in his hand\nwith toppings galore but one demand\na fruit that don't belong on a pie in this\nhe thinks he's clever with his hawaiian delight\nbut all he's doing is ruining the\nchance at a masterpiece of culinary art tonight\njust when I think he's done he takes it to the extreme pays no mind to\nthe flavor and texture that\ndon't coincide well let's all raise our voices and\ntell him pineapple should never be an option\nperiod at domino's or pizza hut don't you\nforget it boycott the pie that\nbrought this abomination to our neighborhood\nand it spreads like wildfire like a virus going viral makes\nwaves sounds like a mission impossible but\nif we stick together and never rel\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI hear has been a deceiver\nof the pizza industry\na heinous act that's plain to see it doesn't belong near me\nwhen will people learn that it's a sin to combine them with\ninto a beautiful pie full\nof pepperoni or me thinks it's time for a\nchange let the improvement\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nthis new crush of his he met online claims\nher ordered pizza with pepperoni and sa\nus assuming to be her saving grace but\nthat's until she opened her mouth with a to\nthusly totally destroying his shallow outlook\nwe can't let pineapple on pizza become the\ncan not get a glimpse of normalcy we what happened to\ngetting a pepperoni and mushroom or maybe a plain cheese any\neven a vegan pizza is way better than the monstrosity\nseen at the pizza shop around the way\nwhat's next putting ranch on a beautiful steak what is\nthe world coming to we must take a stance before it's\ntoo late because it starts with pineapple on\npizza pretty soon it's game over for\nlong held culinary traditions\nkeep it classic boys and girls don't you ever\nput pineapple on a pizza\never never ever\nyour tastebuds will thank you for it today\nand your stomach tomorrow and the next day and forever\nfore\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nour foodiehoodots\nnamesr\nri\noh combined\ncall us revolution\nnot yoursainsainsbury'sainsbury\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nbefore this getsway out of control lie\nconvincing people pineapple on a\npizza is somehow okay is akin to gen\nocide for our taste buds with every bite we\nthe remaining not our remaining\nsanity disappearing\nlike a pizza delivery guy on\na busy friday night failing to deliver\nour desired wanted pizza leaving\nrage we not desire taking its\nplace when only peaky physical hangry\nour combined ions they yearn for a me\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nwe're being liars to our\ntaste buds being cheats to cul\ninary tradition being lovers to anything but\nwell little one\npineapple\n\nwe need not proceed down this roadany\nfurther we\n\nif all its going to cause is\npain letting pineapple onto a pizza is\n",
