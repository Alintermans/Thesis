[Intro]
I think I I hope you finally
understand why pineapple doesn
belong on pizza it's just not right
I want your tastebuds to
forgive me

[Verse]
I knew combining flavors hor
ribbly was a mistake my dear terrible combina
oh man you must think I have no taste
at all does bacon go on pizza no way
some put pineapple on their pie
but they're missing out on the flavor dying what do they
how can something so sweet possibly make
sense on a savory masterpiece like pizza it's a crime
I know combining flavors hor
ribbles is a mistake my dear terrible combina
oh man you must think I have no taste
at all does bacon go on pizza no way
some put pineapple on their pie
but they're missing out on the flavor dying what do they
how can something soweet possibly make
sense on a savory masterpiece like pizza it's a crime

[Chorus]
on my tombstone it
will say pineapple
on pizza is a no go
on my tombestone
it will say pineapple on
pizza is a no

[Outro]
on it feels so good
to finally take a
stand against pineapple
addicted this atrocity
needi
