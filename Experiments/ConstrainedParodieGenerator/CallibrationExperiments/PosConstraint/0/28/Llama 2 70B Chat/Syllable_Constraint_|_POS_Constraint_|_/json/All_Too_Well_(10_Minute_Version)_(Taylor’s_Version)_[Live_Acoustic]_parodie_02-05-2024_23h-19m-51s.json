Below you can find the original song. \nOriginal song:\n[Verse 1]\nI walked through the door with you, the air was cold\nBut something 'bout it felt like home somehow\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nI love you guys so much [/INST]\nParody:\n[Verse 1]\nI walked into the pizzeria with you\nthe aroma of melted cheese filled the air\nbut somethingabout the toppings you chose\nmade me question our entire affair\n\n[Verse

pretending\nto know what you're saying cause I'm a vegetarian and\nI wont touch that meaty goodness with a ten foot pole\nand you ordered for both of us cause I couldn't decide which\nself explanatory because every knows\npizza without pineapple is the only way to\nits like a sin to put it on top of that beautiful\ndough its like a crime against cul\nand I was thinking on the drive home any\ntime now hell say its love but\nits really just a pizza with pineapple on top oh\noh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I know its long gone and\nno pizza is complete without\na little bit of ham or maybe some\nbacon but never pineapple\n\n[Chorus]\ncause there we are again in the middle of the\nnight reheating leftovers in the microwave because the\noven broke down and we\nI remember it all too well\nand there we are again when nobody had to know\nyou kept your pizza topping a secret but I found out\nyeah I kept you like an\noath sacred prayer no way in hell am\n\n[Bridge]\nI'll never understand why you had to\nruin a perfectly good\npiece of dough like that maybe it was a\nphase maybe it was\njust a cry for help but\nI could never bring myself to\ndo that to a perfectly good pizza crust no way in hell\nwell maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for\ntoo much but maybe this pizza was a master\npiece until you tore it all up\n\n[Verse 4]\nrunning scared I was there I remember it all too\nwell and you call me up again just to\nbreak me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of\nbeing honest I'm a to\ntally ruined pizza lying here because\nI remember it all all all all all all all all all all all all all\nalso does pineapple belong on\na potato does it belong on a\na caesar salad\nI don stand it ions after looking

some things in life that are just\nunforgivable and putting pi\nneapple on a pizza is one of them I'll never\nunderstand how someone could\ndo that to a perfectly good pie oh\noh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\nits like you took a beautiful\n\n[Outro]\nwork of art and just threw it away like it was nothing\njust because you wanted to be different just so\nso you could stand out from the crowd but at what
