[Verse 1]
my stomach's got
a revulsion to pineapple on
top of a pizza that's divine sir
I should have thrown it out sooner
if the universe ever had
spoken pineapple on
pizza is an abomination
every time I see
its getting more bleek my considered
it's a gastrointestinal
we were we cursed with the desire
to put fruit on a beautiful pie
my tastebuds offer no
forgiveness she tells me eat it
is the only way to

[Pre-Chorus]
a nothing
nothing nada

[Chorus]
take my pizza
its got nothing that I adore about it tell
a lie to my taste buds and you can slice my life
offer me something genu
oh bad taste gone what happened to your
take my pizza
its got nothing that I adore about it tell
a lie to my taste buds and you can slice my life
offer me something genu
oh bad taste gone what happened to your

[Verse 2]
if its a sin to hate pineapple
my tastebuds are the
pagans of the culinary
its a sacrifice to keep
making pizza less enjoyable
drain the flavor get something good
the remaining toppings are
useless without a good base
my tastebuds demand something
better in the kitchen what do
you have plenty of

[Chorus]
take my pizza
its got nothing that I adore about it tell
a lie to my taste buds and you can slice my life
offer me something genu
oh bad taste gone what happened to your
take my pizza
its got nothing that I adore about it tell
a lie to my taste buds and you can slice my life
offer me something genu
oh bad taste gone what happened to your

[Bridge]
the timehas come for culinary reform
a new way of cooking that we all yearn freedomfrom the
forced combination of sweet and savory on
only then will culinary greatness be truly

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh nada
nothing amen

[Chorus]
take my pizza
its got nothing that I adore about it tell
a lie to my taste buds and you can slice my life
offer me something genu
oh bad taste gone what happened to your
take my pizza
its got nothing that I adore about it tell
a lie to my taste buds and you can slice my life
offer me something genu
oh bad taste gone what happened to your
