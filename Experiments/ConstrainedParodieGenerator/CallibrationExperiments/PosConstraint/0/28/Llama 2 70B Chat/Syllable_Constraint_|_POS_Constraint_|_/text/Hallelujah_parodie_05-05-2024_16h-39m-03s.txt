[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's a crime against humanity
it's like putting ketchup on a
a masterpiece artwork of flav
the cheese and sauce blend in perfect harmony

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza

[Verse 2]
you say you like the sweetness it brings
but to me it's a confusing
it clashes with the savory taste of the
it's like wearing a
tutu to a funeral process
or singing off key in a choir of ang

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza

[Verse 3]
you may argue it's a matter
of personal preference and
but to me it's a culinary abom
like serving sushi with a side of ran
its just not meant to be combined
like oil and water they just don't blend in

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza

[Verse 4]
I acknowledge your right to your
weird pizza choices but please don't
your pineapple on my pizza pie it's just
like drawing a mustache on the
monalisa it's a work of
art don't try to fix what ain't broke fix

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza oh
pineapple on apizza oh
pineapple onapizza oh
pineapple ona pizza oh
pineapple onapizza oh
pineapple apizza oh ah
oh pineapple on a pizza
pineapple onipizza oh
oh pineappleon a pizza oh

[Outro]
remember the time we ordered

[Additional Lyrics]
artwork of flav having a
it's a mater ofpersonal
it's a culinary abomination
like serving sushi with a side of ran
drawing a mustache on the mon
its just not meant to be combined whatever that

[Additional Lyrics]
the saying goes variety
is the spice of life but in this
case it's just a recipe for disaster
like playing jazz at a funeral
its just not appropriate it
just don't make no sense it's like trying to fit

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a restaurant
out there that will tolerate your
pineapple pizza abomination but
not in my kitchen you can be sure of
that oh no oh no oh no no no
its got an entire pizza shop devoted
