all my sins need cleansing from this culinary crime scene
well little one I don't want
bananas and ham right now are clashing like the
so let the debate run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
she walks in the house with a look of disgust
puts down her slice protesting with
on his pizza to question his taste
but it's buried deep under the pineapple and
our beloved toppings swap places she has in
her mind a masterful plan to change the
and brings out the pineapple's bitter taste's game on to
even I concede that she's got what my palate lacks it's
for the thrill of the debate
and you don't disturb the harmony of a classic
but she comes armed with vehement conviction to
avoid at allcostsalmost gone I hesitate to part
after our shared beloved meal
saying once and for all it's time to depart we bond
over our shared love for pizza but tonight I am thinking
yikes debate but tonight I am champion
before this new encounter or ruin

[Verse 2: Eminem]
this delicious round whole this delicious
our shared enjoyed intact becomes a battle
I leave to soothe my savory soul but come
into my being when I'm confronted with
now seemingly destroyed my favorite meal can't
what did I do invite this wrinkle my willpower
was so strong but now broken I'm compelled to defend this
been betrayed by my own tongue's deceitful bend could I have defended
just our beloved toppings which way should I trends towards compromise
letting my taste buds be led astray this
I'm taking a stand making a plea for tradition
but I can't help but wonder could I have prevented this
but instead of our shared our love be
turn pie into I battle onward to
up holding my believes a fierce in
been on it sideways but believe it or not things
pineapple on pizza is getting a

what drove me to it in the first place debate
but now that I've tasted it I can't go back debate but
