[Verse 1]
now I've heard a rumor that's
a source of endless chatter is this
about a fruit on a pizza pie that's amiss
you believe in the savory
some say pepper's necessary
but I'm here to argue against the pineap

[Chorus]
hallelujah non parellel
hollarin' out our feelings

[Verse 2]
you adore the traditional to
your taste buds know exactly what
it's about the texture must agreement ens
she added pineapple to the
her beloved pizza's topology
but since that fateful day her hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah non parellel
hollarin' out our feelings

[Verse 3]
you utter her perceived blaspheme
my beloved pizza's purity
but if I may indeed so humble be it
there's a balance with diverse delightful
your taste palate will no longer
this debated fruit's controversial hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah non parellel
hollarin' out our feelings

[Verse 4]
I strive for openmindedness
we hold quite differing opinions
our heated debates persistently pers
but even in our disag
our shared dedication to
that thing we call delivery halleluj

[Chorus]
hallelujah hilarioso
laughers share stories courageoes
repeat endlessly our thoughts
tasty options interroughthes
unique gastromsphere challenges
joy exists sans preference set
delcicios variations bond
praiseful gather support end
creativerses fuel express

[Outro]
pizza pie unity saves night

[Additional Lyrics]
ohhhhhh you used to love in peace
I remember those salad days
we grew up having simply that me pleasess
but now confronted with your fruitful choice
unripe hatred only grows lou
our supposed bonding weakened through your hallel

[Additional Lyrics]
each ingredient has a tale
our shared longing can prevail
but when it comes to our toppings it seems
and sweetening yet our will for
a side plate provides a more just
and a harmony of understanding achieved

[Additional Lyrics]
soon there may another god
but the only truths proven worth
respectfulness even in passing on ide
or it might not be pureness in us
it'd simply be our shared am
our shared aversion to the bitter hallel
