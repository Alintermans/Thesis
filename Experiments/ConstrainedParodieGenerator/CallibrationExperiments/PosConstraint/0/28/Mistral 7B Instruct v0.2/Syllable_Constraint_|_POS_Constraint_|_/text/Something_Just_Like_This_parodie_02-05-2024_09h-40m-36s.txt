[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been considering trends
a tale of modern life
pork and pineapple comb
kitschy and not quite right
avocados on
or pizza in a twe
but I'm not the type who'd choose that combo please believe

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she asked quizically eyes
why such averseness
I search for dining simple pure
for some traditional rel
no fancy salad
no unusual
just something my palette can
tasteful and
I want consistency still

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
don't wanna something
unique I confess
something standard truly
is my must something just like this
uhu icherica
donuta pipic
uahu icherica
don't wanna something just like
this uhu icherica

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I remember eating out
an experience or
a slice of history
a tradition or more
but pepperoni ad
the fruits of our will
but I don't fit traditions bound tight with

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
her raised curiosity tongue
why such resistance then
my tastebuds crave only plain
with no complicated twist
no experiment
no unusual
just stability my tongue
needles its calling is

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
my desired cuisine just
what is tastes exactly this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh my valued dining still at
umahuma icher
umphana bica
oh my valued dining
just what is tastes exactly this
umahoaca bica
ohumanila
uhowevertafi

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
now dinner goes where
where's your culinary
I've niente looking for something bland
off the ordinary list
no fancy courses
no unexpected
only basics my senses
cherish and fulfill am
my desired delight just

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh my wanted dining still at
just what is tastes exactly this
oh my wanted dining still at
