And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI spite you, I spite you\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nhey there no\nthe fungus on my pizza\nthe rotten taste that lingers so gotta\nget rid of it pronto time\nbefore infection sets in\nwe can throw it in the trash where it belongs\nthen clean our hands and mouth\nand our remaining slices we\nwill cherish all the more my friend believe\nour remaining slic\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI spite you I spite you\nI spite you I spite you\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere did you come from hiding in\nmy trusted fridge was your disguise too sweet\nyour supposed virtue but now here\nthe truth comes creeping\ndecomposition takes without a beat a\nmonstrosity before us\nan outrage in the making\ncould something so vile be creation\nthat anyone would call you food\nand welcome you with open\narmed what would anyone be thinking no\ndo not adore you\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nshould not let you share with me my dining well\nyou are already the\nfoul taste inside my mouth\n\nshould not let you share with me my dining well\nyou are already the\nfoul taste inside my mouth\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nshould not invite you share with me my dining\nyou are already the\nfoul taste inside my mouth\n\nshould not invite you share with me my dining\nyou are already the\nfoul taste inside my mouth\n\nshould not invite you share by us my serving\nyou are already the\nfoul taste inside our\n\nshould not entertain you share on my dish served\nyou are already the\nfoul taste inside my mouth\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI loath you I despise\nI scrape you I remove\nmy remaining slices\n",
