[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
craving pineappleless pie is my only crime
started with plain cheese but now it's not the same at all the
audacity of pineapple on a pizza
now my stomach turns as I see it on display
at the pizzeria windowpane on display
so I eat around it to avoid the dismay
and it lingers inmy

[Pre-Chorus]
but I sight fresh basil on
they add pineapple what
get it off
can't fathom such a monstrosity
and makingitreal

[Chorus]
wrath stirs up tomato sauce to a bo
floatin' around slices of
need to draw the line hear me
or I might really blowup
callinbliss may history
seeingreduced to what real
on my pizza high

[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just finec
razzle pizza without the pineapple kindly
it started out with a slice then pineapples did arrive
its canned sweetness an unwelcoming diveinto
just my ething badest to imagination
in my is headacheservationationand
even my beloved getting' to partsides and
and my is all in its

[Pre-Chorus]
but its getting married to
its beingadded after
take it off
as they just ignoremyrebell
and beingriduced

[Chorus]
wrath stirs up tomato sauce to a bo
floatin' around slices of
need to draw the line hear me
or I might really blowup
callinbliss may history
seeingreduced to what real
on my pizza high
