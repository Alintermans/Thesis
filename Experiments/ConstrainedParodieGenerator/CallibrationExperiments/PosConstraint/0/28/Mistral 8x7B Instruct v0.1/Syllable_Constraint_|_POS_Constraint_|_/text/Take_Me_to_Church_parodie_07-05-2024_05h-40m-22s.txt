[Verse 1]
my palate's gotta
hate for pineapple on a pizza
think it's a travesty and blunder
should stick with pepperoni or
if the chefs insist on making
fruity monstrosities
each bite's diminishingreturns
an unsolicited
we were serving slices we could trust
but then they added pineapple
my tastebuds scream for justice all
the time invaded by the sweetness
say no to pineapple on
my beloved pizza pie and what
were they thinking adding

[Pre-Chorus]
a sorry
choice selection

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at all costs a laresize
my hatred for it you won't believeto
take me to delivery
I'll send it back with disapproval
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at all costs a laresize
my hatred for it you won't believeto
take me to delivery
I'll send it back with disapproval

[Verse 2]
if I'm an opponent of the wrong
it's pineapple on a
pizza that's just so very wrong
they ruined the whole plotwith
added fruit on topnot needed at
ahis expense artful decept
another ingredient
it doesn't deserve any
it tastes all bitter like rancid
a failed experimentthat looks
another wasted

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at all costs a laresize
my hatred for it you won't believeto
take me to delivery
I'll send it back with disapproval
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at all costs a laresize
my hatred for it you won't believeto
take me to delivery
I'll send it back with disapproval

[Bridge]
no pineappleor or caesar once this ritual
these sacred slices profaneand sensibilitiesill
on that sacrilegewilllosehumanit
where only my beloved original still truly

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh sorry
selection pit

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at all costs a laresize
my hatred for it you won't believeto
take me to delivery
I'll send it back with disapproval
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at all costs a laresize
my hatred for it you won't believeto
take me to delivery
I'll send it back with disapproval
