[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that piewith pineapple
my taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow
and that slimy chunk of fruit on my pizza
left a lingering taste of regret that won

[Verse 2]
oh our slices intertwined like a mistake unf
your sweet pineapple chunks and my savory
chewed and chewed but the taste never blended smoothlike
a relationship doomed since its inception

[Pre-Chorus]
and I wonder what was I
thinking putting pineapple
on my pizza was a good idea at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on my favorite
meal ruined by the tropical intruderinvadingwhere
tomato sauce and cheese should
reign supreme I remember it

[Verse 3]
greasy box by the doorstepit we delivery hoped
but alas the sight of pineapple chunksmetastasized like a
cancer I couldn't abidehow could something so wrongfeel
so right until it wasn't anymoreand you said
pineapple belongs on pizza it's truebut not my pizza
fruits aren't meant for my cheesepleaseno more
and I tried to scrape it all offbut the damage was
done and I knew I'd never look at pizza quite the same
after my failed experiment
making me yearn for the simpler times when
pepperoni and mushrooms
were enough to satisfy my pizza cravingswithout
the unwelcome addition of pineapple ruing it

[Pre-Chorus]
and I regret my choice last
night knowing pineappleand pizza
don't belong in the same sentenceor
meal together oh oh oh no

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on my plateanother
slice ruined by pineappleintrudingwhere it didn't belong
before I consigned it
to the garbage where it belonged
but the memory remains too well today oh oh
it'll never be the same or what was my favorite
meal minefieldnavig
to be enjoyed I remember it

[Bridge]
maybe I'm just beingclosedmindered
when it comes pepperoni
and pineapplebut the combination
of their shared presence
is overwhelmingly
unappetizing to me no
matter how much they insistit's just a preference I can
never really warm up tono matter how many times they
say it's an acquiredtaste I remember it
like it was yesterdayoh no no

[Verse 4]
my beloved pizzaas I once knewit is forever
changed by the addition of pineapple
my beloved oughthave been left untarnished now it'll never be
the same without the bitter
taste of regret of pineapple's invasion
every mouthfula daily strugglewithout iredeemably mar
again ruined by the thought process
the pain continues I remember it
every ounce of
my being wished it ortion of icking pine
could ounce of my be without this fruitiful sor
but once his was his is no long longer
or my is his is saved

[Verse 5]
