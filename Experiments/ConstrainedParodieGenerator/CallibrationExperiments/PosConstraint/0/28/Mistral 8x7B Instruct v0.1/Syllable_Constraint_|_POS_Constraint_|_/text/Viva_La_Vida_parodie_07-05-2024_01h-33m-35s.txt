[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
toppings perfected to my taste
now in the morning I sigh alone
longing for the pizza days

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I cravedcontrol of
my cheese and tomato throne command
thought pineapple would add some
never guessed it'd ruin my landmass
one quick bite made me realize
with every bite my joy
and my crusty kingdom falls apart am
ong ruins of gorgonzola and

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear dinner calling mine's not ringing
crust sounds cheesy no more singing sweet
take me backwards I beg or des
he pure margherita before this dread
for no reason my canines astound
soon I tasted lying all
once I ate pineapple
but those were yet my pizza days

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it tasted all grand and noble
bought for me courtiers' approval
seeing slices and all feel as bland
won respect now stripped by my handcrafted
preposteros proclaimed do
as I order with an arrog
nevermore any love for that foolish kind
askin'why it'd once enjoyed just

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear hunger seeking mine'' not ring
bananas ham burgers do better
let me adore you kindly or
I'll forsake all exotic matterless
for no motivation you can still
my sacred haven bould be so be it
nevermore another
but those were yet my pizza days

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohhhs and aahhs all around
cheers our gathered will
exclude my rejected
dishes my be found are
