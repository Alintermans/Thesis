[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've read recipes online
the savory and the
toppings that align fam
marinara or al
fredo up to you
but pineapples on a
pizza ain't no bueno for me though this much is

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said tastes diversify
well cheese and ham suffice
I ain't hankering after
a pineapple delight sight
no weird enrichment
the sour sweet def
late contradicts my pizza
planet we desire
what is universally

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
appetence remains uns
ound appetizers
hands down pepperoni
or sausage will suffice again
oh I crave something just
ike pizza tw el
th appetite ful
oh I hunger strike justly for
my desired pizza pie

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I ruminated on the
the internet and all
the sites it revealed are
a waste and I recall
and anchovie angles bar
the doors of my opened
palate to pineapple nevermore a bite

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
I ask bakers time and again
why proffer pineapple
I search instead for savory
that all human paletes
can understand and
this pro choice absurd
too cheeses my beloved ought
resist what is opposed

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
my sacred family meal
what evil genius thus in

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh we call thing not at all a
pie symphony serende
oh I yearn something
delish delectation
oh my will power truly in
distression lies within
please ignore protests
insists delivery

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
now gather close and
nevermore propose us
your supposed so called in style dish
with every single taste
some simple options
an obvious fact
there shouldn'itta be allowed
putta my beloved do
yourself favor limiters

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
to what should only ever be
considered condiments sir I
want something just lilke this without
