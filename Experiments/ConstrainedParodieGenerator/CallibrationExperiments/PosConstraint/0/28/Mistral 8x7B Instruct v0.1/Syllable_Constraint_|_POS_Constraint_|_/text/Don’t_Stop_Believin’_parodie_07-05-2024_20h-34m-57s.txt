[Verse 1]
just a regular dough circling in
on a plain cheese pizza plate so bare a to
just a pineapple slave brought up in a cold can
they wish to venture on a cheesy

[Verse 2]
a citrus chunk upon a disk
the taste that none should ever risk
for a dare it meets disaster
its gone before you even taste her

[Pre-Chorus]
pepper
strewn and scattered all around
its yellowed cursed pieces bound
cheese stretches long
crusts'll never be the same
juicy chunks forever in

[Verse 3]
spinach's bitterness
ham mixed with tomatoress
toppings to order off the a la
nevermore will

[Verse 4]
an educated pal
an acquired delighted
oh an epicenter of
its been before and after and in

[Pre-Chorus]
pepper
strewn and scattered all around
its yellowed cursed pieces bound
cheese stretches long
crusts'll never be the same
juicy chunks forever in

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
keep on disbelieving
save your pizza from dece
pick pineapple
letting pizza staying
being
reject pineap
keep on ignoring fruit
addicted atop your
pizza circles
