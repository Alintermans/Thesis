Is this just fantasy?\nCaught in a landslide, no escape from reality\nOpen your eyes, look up to the skies and see\nI'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy\nBecause I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low\nAny way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me\n\n[Verse 1]\nMama, just killed a man\nPut a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead\nMama, life had just begun\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away\nMama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow\nCarry on, carry on as if nothing really matters\n\n[Verse 2]\nToo late, my time has come\nSends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time\nGoodbye, everybody, I've got to go\nGotta leave you all behind and face the truth\nMama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)\nI don't wanna die\nI sometimes wish I'd never been born at all\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI see a little silhouetto of a man\nScaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?\nThunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me\n(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico\nBut I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me\nHe's just a poor boy from a poor family\nSpare him his life from this monstrosity\nEasy come, easy go, will you let me go?\nBismillah! No, we will not let you go\n(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let me go) Will not let you go\n(Let me go) Will not let you go\n(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\n(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die?\nOh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!\nJust gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here\n[Outro]\n(Ooh)\n(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)\nNothing really matters, anyone can see\nNothing really matters\nNothing really matters to me\nAny way the wind blows [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro]\nis this a good sliceor just a pineapple\nhidden among toppings I can't escape its chill\ngotta check the pie before I take a bite\nis it savory or sweet taking over\neasy to like thin crust italian style high low alone iced\nany way this freaky roundup won't do it for me to me\n\n[Verse 1]\nhold on must inspect this\nlooking at the slice it's got chunks of pineapple on it\nheld up hopes for pepperon\nbut now it's destroyed by this tropical\nmockery mama mia no can do\nby tomorrow I'll just order another\nstill I carry on as if nothing really matters tastes\n\n[Verse 2]\nthere's still time to change the\ntopping order to what I preferably savor\nregret chosen pineapple added on\nthink saver make it all about the meats no\nleafy ingredient instead of\nmy canned enemy called\nhe's been haunting my pizza forever bored\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nwhat do those slices conceal inside the box\nscallions sage cooked herbs caramelized onion surprise\nfritta mushroom and prosciutto how can I resist it\nyes chefs I'm just a foodie needing savory bounty feed me well icanswallowitall wholeheartedly\nbut pineapple won't do I can't eat\nits canned soaked sweetness even with tomato\ndelights I'll pass on this dish tonight iced\nsuch caninedged slicestumblecan be\nfoundat cheapfastservebutrefusene\nbeenaddedcallednamedcalledordered\nbeenaddedcallednamedorderededged\ncanaddedcalledordered\ncalledorderedcalleded\nnotevereverevernevernevermore\nno no no no no no no\nmamma mia let me go please iced begged me go let me go let\npapa legba is kind serving me enchiladas instead of\n\n[Verse 4]\nso you figured my giving in your game would win\nagain my giving it a missing its a sin\nbaby ain't no way this topping I can\nonly have so much forced silly compromise newborn\n\n[Outro]\noh\nindifference\ndoesnothingthingthingringthingingingthinging\nmingling together\ndonefinishedfinished\n",
