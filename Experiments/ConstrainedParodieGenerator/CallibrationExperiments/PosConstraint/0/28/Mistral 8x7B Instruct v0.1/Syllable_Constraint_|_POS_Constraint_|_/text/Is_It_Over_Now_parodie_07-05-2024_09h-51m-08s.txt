juxtaposition

[Pre-Chorus]

tered later I see that pineapple's still on the tray there
you hesitate but you partake in this culinary far
my friend's advice you should disregard because it's bizarre baby

[Chorus]

ple got added to your pie it's sacrileg
de instead of taking a bite

no to pineapple

well rumors about me partaking
but I won't part

than with pineapple embark
nevertheless out of spite

your tastebuds in an outrageous downward spiral like a ton

[Chorus]
was your tastebuds still alive when pineap
ple got added to your pie it's sacrileg
de instead of taking a bite
at least pass me the pepperoni
is your tastebuds still alive now I ask

[Post-Chorus]

these yellow chunks bring
in mixed company causing a
fight in the kitchen over

than with pineapple embark
nevertheless out of spiteful spite
I'll order pineapple tonight my friend said
