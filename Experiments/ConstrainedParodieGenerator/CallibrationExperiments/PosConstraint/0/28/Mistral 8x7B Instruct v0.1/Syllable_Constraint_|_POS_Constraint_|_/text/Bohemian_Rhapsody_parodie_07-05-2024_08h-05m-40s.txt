[Intro]
is this a good sliceor just a pineapple
hidden among toppings I can't escape its chill
gotta check the pie before I take a bite
is it savory or sweet taking over
easy to like thin crust italian style high low alone iced
any way this freaky roundup won't do it for me to me

[Verse 1]
hold on must inspect this
looking at the slice it's got chunks of pineapple on it
held up hopes for pepperon
but now it's destroyed by this tropical
mockery mama mia no can do
by tomorrow I'll just order another
still I carry on as if nothing really matters tastes

[Verse 2]
there's still time to change the
topping order to what I preferably savor
regret chosen pineapple added on
think saver make it all about the meats no
leafy ingredient instead of
my canned enemy called
he's been haunting my pizza forever bored

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
what do those slices conceal inside the box
scallions sage cooked herbs caramelized onion surprise
fritta mushroom and prosciutto how can I resist it
yes chefs I'm just a foodie needing savory bounty feed me well icanswallowitall wholeheartedly
but pineapple won't do I can't eat
its canned soaked sweetness even with tomato
delights I'll pass on this dish tonight iced

no no no no no no no
mamma mia let me go please iced begged me go let me go let
papa legba is kind serving me enchiladas instead of

[Verse 4]
so you figured my giving in your game would win
again my giving it a missing its a sin
baby ain't no way this topping I can
only have so much forced silly compromise newborn

[Outro]
oh
