[Intro]
I hope i, I hope I clearly see
why pineapple should never be
on a savoryslice of pizza
I've tried it once or twice or
three times but

[Verse]
it's just not right for me my friend
sweet and savory's a trend to bend oh man what a mess
the taste it just doesn't impress me
like a classic margherita would do for
me and you instead of ham and
pineapple it's tomatoes and mozzarella
so let's keep pizzas traditional shall
we stick to the classics and avoid this faux pas before we
regret it regret it regret
tyranny of combining sweet with salty should never

inappropriate on my beloved pizza
a culinary sin is what
it is so let this be my plea keep pineapple away
from my pizza believe me you'll thank me
and your taste buds will agree keep pineapple off the menu

[Chorus]
off my pizza off
off my pizza off
off my pizza offoffoff
off my pizza off
off my pizza offoffoff
off my pizza off

[Outro]
off my pizza off
off off off it belongs
could you imagine it
are you appalled at the thought it
