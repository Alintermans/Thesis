[Verse 1]
do you taste pineapple on your
slice of pizza pie and shake your head in dismayed surprise
at the sweet and savory combo that
ruins every bite you take
do you ever hesitate to take a
piece with pineapple on it when you're
at a party full of people
with differing tastes
how many times have you regretted putting pineapple on
your pizza and vowed never to do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
do I love pineapple on my pizza pieslice
hopin' that you'll share my viewsayin' no to pineapple
on your pizza tonightdo I love pineapple
that the nights were mainly made for pepperoni and

[Chorus]
giving pineapple
on pizza a chancewhen
you regret it
I never do
maybe I should
open my mind to
different pizza toppings
now I am resolved
giving pineapple

[Verse 2]
so do you dare to share
a slice of pineapple pizza with me
or will you stick to your traditional to
loyalty to pizza puristsdo you ever feel the
need to rebel against the norms and give pineapple a chance
but you don't due to your fear of societal
disapprovalbut we could be together if

[Pre-Chorus]
do I love pineapple on my pizza pieslice
hopin' that you'll share my viewsayin' no to pineapple
on your pizza tonightdo I love pineapple
that the nights were mainly made for pepperoni and

[Chorus]

enjoy every bitei
in my heart knowprobably enjoy
pineapple on pizza even more than
youcan appreciateour differ
ing pizza preferences

[Outro]
do I accept pineapple on pizza or not
ask yourself if it's something you can live withoutdo
I love pineapple on my pizza or do you
that everyone should be entitled to their ownop
inions on pizza toppingsdo I love pineapple
want me enjoying pineapple on pizza or not
will you offer me pineapple on your next pizza night
