[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a believer told it
should be forbidden on a
pizza pie ain't right to include it marinara's
only worthy companion should be sausage or pepper
oni all my hatred needs a
reminder that it's just a sinful creation
so little one listen

[Verse 1: Eminem]
it shows up on the table with its spiny
spikes nobody wants to touch it
on a pizza slice it shouldn't be
but they still place it thinking it fits with cheese and
tomato sauce it doesn't belong beside it
who cooked up this atrocity of a
pizza pie it's got no business being there inside it
just why can't they see it's a crime they're commitin' put it outside
in the trash where it belongs
or better yet don't bring it home from the grocery
store it's got no respect for tradition it de
serves to be kicked out of the pizza family for good
if you won't listen to me
getting ahead of myself don't include it oh
pineapple pizza you're no pal of mine leave it behind you it
alters tastes and ruins reputations fine
as a separate entity but please

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a defender saying
that the very notion is
an insult to pizza lovers world over my apolo
gies to those who thought it was a viable option let
me clarify it should be out
of the question I don't want to admit to
however accepting

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a few inches given every new
pizza place tried to cash in on the latest trend
you give it an inch and suddenly it thinks
it owns the whole damn pizza the audacious
audacity of putting pineapple on pizza
what began as a joke became reality it
ended up on every menu can't believe it
was once praised it's what nightmares are made of the atrocities people to
once their were committed no one in history dared to desecrate
a pizza like this it's beyond the pale
we simply can't allow it to prevail no one
willing to defend it it's a lost cause if there ever was
one when will they come to their senses and see
don taint a good pizza with pineapple
there's no coming back from that mistake
getting ahead of myself don't include it
stop and think before adding it to your
plate it doesn t belong
its got no place on a real pizza waiting
for the apocalypse of pizza toppings to finally
aw

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a defender saying
that the very notion is
an insult to pizza lovers world over my apolo
gies to those who thought it was a viable option let
me clarify it should be out
of the question I don't want to admit to
however accepting

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my voice to anyone
call me
op
osition
will they ever see it
when will they call it a stop calling

[Verse 3: Eminem]
in the delusion that this evil vill
aim has any right to stake its claim on
pizza night it's time to band together and overthrow
monarchy of pineapple on pizza before it
no longer can be stopped can t let it
take control of every
and all pizzas forever destroying
all tradition none of us can afford to lose
our beloved beacon our saving grace
pizza it's becoming a lost art
destroyers of pizza trying to cash in
we know the truth don t let them fool you none

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I won t stand for including
pineapple on a pizza
another day of having to fight for our pizza rights
again little
one I don
t want to imagine a future where
we regret
because all my hatred needed
was someone to speak up and say enough of this
so please listen to me
