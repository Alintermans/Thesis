[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I spite you, I spite you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hey there no
the fungus on my pizza
the rotten taste that lingers so gotta
get rid of it pronto time
before infection sets in
we can throw it in the trash where it belongs
then clean our hands and mouth
and our remaining slices we
will cherish all the more my friend believe
our remaining slic

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I spite you I spite you
I spite you I spite you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where did you come from hiding in
my trusted fridge was your disguise too sweet
your supposed virtue but now here
the truth comes creeping
decomposition takes without a beat a
monstrosity before us
an outrage in the making
could something so vile be creation
that anyone would call you food
and welcome you with open
armed what would anyone be thinking no
do not adore you

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
should not let you share with me my dining well
you are already the
foul taste inside my mouth
should not let you share with me my dining well
you are already the
foul taste inside my mouth

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
should not invite you share with me my dining
you are already the
foul taste inside my mouth
should not invite you share with me my dining
you are already the
foul taste inside my mouth
should not invite you share by us my serving
you are already the
foul taste inside our
should not entertain you share on my dish served
you are already the
foul taste inside my mouth

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I loath you I despise
I scrape you I remove
my remaining slices
my remaining slices
