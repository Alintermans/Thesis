[Verse 1]
stock up with pineapple ign
its taste deceives and makes you
think it's fine but truth is told ousing it
oh no you'll soon regret it all

[Pre-Chorus]
hi hi hit the bin low low own
hi hi hit the bin low low own
hi hi hit the bin low low own
hi hi hit the bin own

[Chorus]
with the guilt inside its less lonely
here it is moreover does bore
I fell foolish and infected
here it is moreover doing
a yellowy no belonging
an orangey we're condoning

[Post-Chorus]
yeah ok

[Verse 2]
its ruined most of our
but for this joke we feel blessed
we ouldn't let it pass away and
and always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
hi hi hit the bin low low own
hi hi hit the bin low low own
hi hi hit the bin low low own
hi hi hit the bin own

[Chorus]
with the guilt inside its less lonely
here it is moreover does bore
I fell foolish and infected
here it is moreover doing
a yellowy no belonging
an orangey we're condoning

[Post-Chorus]
yeah ok

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and they mistake justly why it
oh yes they want their money back
I got icked trying to find
oh well the why denied minded

[Pre-Chorus]
hi hi hit the bin low low own
hi hi hit the bin low low own
hi hi hit the bin low low own
hi hi hit the bin own

[Chorus]
with the guilt inside its less lonely
here it is moreover does bore
I fell foolish and infected
here it is moreover doing
a yellowy no belonging
an orangey we're condoning

[Outro]
a follying that excusaly
an incorrectibility
a scrollying those who denyers lies
all deluding every eyes
an erring den
