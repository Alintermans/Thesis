[Verse 1]
now they say a pineapple's forlorn
on a pizza it should not be worn
but you don't really care for pizza do ya
it slices up the tastebud
and ruins the savory mood
a pineapple belongs on hawaiian food

[Chorus]
oh pineapple no oh pineap
oh pineapple no oh pineap

[Verse 2]
its sweetness does not belongeth here
it masquerades as a cul
inary speer ough it brings us to tears ough
it spoils our cheesy delight
we push it aside and out of sight
and from our table it scattered a pine

[Chorus]
oh pineapple no oh pineap
oh pineapple no oh pineap

[Verse 3]
they call it a travesty they
do defend their right to deny
a pineapple's place upon a pizza pie
an outrage to our taste buds in a
heinous display of sacrilege
an absurd and broken pizza pie hey hey

[Chorus]
oh pineapple no oh pineap
oh pineapple no oh pineap

[Verse 4]
we did our best its ending
our beloved pizza endinging
what started as a tasty treat is truly
but a shadow of its former
it's destroyed beyond all measure
with pineapple as it centerpiece and curse

[Chorus]
oh pineapple no oh pineap
oh pineapple no oh pineap
oh pineapple no oh pineap
oh pineapple no oh pineap
oh pineapple no oh pineap
oh pineapple no oh pineap
oh pineapple no oh pineap
oh pineapple no oh pineap
oh pineapple no oh pineap

[Outro]
oh pineapple no oh pineap

[Additional Lyrics]
pineapple it broke our
meal it used to be whole before
we made the mistake of adding pineapple
but now it lets us down with every
piece we cut it reveals its dece
its adding insults to our injuries oh

[Additional Lyrics]
the day we added pineapple
our sacred bond was sever
or never to be restored again to us
and remembring everly our
pizza before pineapple was
but a hollowedout shell our beloved pie

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe a pizza exists
where the pineapple does belong
I once believed It could be true but now I
know it'll never be something that we
we may again share it was broken
my beloved pizza it was broken oh no oh
