[Verse 1]
don't put pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against human
you're ruining a classic with
its sweetness and spice how could you do this to me
we belong together nice
but you can't even get

[Pre-Chorus]
we never should have combined these to
there's no excuse for this pineapple on
a pizza is supposed
we never should have made this mistake
there's no excuse for this p
pineapple belongs on

[Chorus]
stop putting it on my pizza please oh please
its a terrible idea
you must see the light of reason
there's no excuse for this pineapple on
a pizza is supposed to be
my willpower weakens as I

[Verse 2]
how did this happen how did it come to this
did you forget what a real
manhood requires just stick
respect pizza take leave serious less
its got nothing to do with
why so seriously so

[Pre-Chorus]
we never should have combined these to
there's no excuse for this pineapple on
a pizza is supposed
we never should have made this mistake
there's no excuse for this p
pineapple belongs on

[Chorus]
stop putting it on my pizza please oh please
its a terrible idea

a pizza is supposed to be
my willpower weakens as I

[Pre-Chorus]
we never should have combined these to
there's no excuse for this pineapple on
a pizza is supposed
we never should have made this mistake
there's no excuse for this p
pineapple belongs on

[Bridge]
its got absolutely
nothing to do with
in our culture or
should we really change
our sacred trad

[Outro]
stop putting pineapple on my pizza please oh
its a terrible crime
your missing the whole point of a pizza is to
its loaded with toppings that complement each to
its supposed to be savory
its intended to be enjoyed
its intended to be enjoyed
