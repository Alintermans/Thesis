[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
absurdity to me it is a crime scene
at the dinner table
I say again and again my dear it
does not belong with cheese or pepperoni no way
in the land of toppings

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I make a face and throw my plate away
just to express myself every day
and I i feel increasingly a different
and then I head outside and shout at the sky so high
and my voice echoes through eternity and
I scream at the top of my lungs with
my beating heart

[Chorus]
and I sayeeee egoogy
