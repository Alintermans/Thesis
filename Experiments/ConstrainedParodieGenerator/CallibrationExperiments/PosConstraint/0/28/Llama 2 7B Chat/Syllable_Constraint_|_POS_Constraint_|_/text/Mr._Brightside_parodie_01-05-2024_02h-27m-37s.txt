[Verse]
step away from the pineapple on my pizza pie
ainвt nobody got time for that tropical lie
it started out with a topping expectation ended
up in this pineapple messy situation
only a pineapple goodness was expected
now I'm chewin' on my anger and she's callin
an uber for this pineapple disaster zone
and it'd the after

[Pre-Chorus]
but she'll take extra cheese now
she had to take it slow
going down
and it's all up in my head oh oh oh
and taking control

[Chorus]
jealousy munchin' on pineapple like
spreadinвg toppings on thin air
lickin' on lies and alib
but it keeps me up at night
bittercore rising like a
dinged up in my head oh
out of my stupid

[Guitar Solo]
