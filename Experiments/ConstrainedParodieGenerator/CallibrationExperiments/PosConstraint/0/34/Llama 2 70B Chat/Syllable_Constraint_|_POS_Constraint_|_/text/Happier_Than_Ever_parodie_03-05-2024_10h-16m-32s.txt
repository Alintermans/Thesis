[Chorus]
when I get a slice of
pineapple on my pizza
I feel like I've been deceived it
it puts me inaquer

[Verse 1]
can't believe they put that topping on without a
care they ruined a classic
it's like they took a master
piece and drew a mustache on
and now my tastebuds are pay
the price for their mistake makes me
upset I can't take it
it shouldn't be allowed it to
pping on a pizza that's just not right it
it's confusing a pizza without it its is its missing something
but I guess is to
be expected when your taste
in toppings gone awry oh I wish I could explain
why pineapple doesn't belong

[Chorus]
when I getta slice a pineapple on my am
I feel like I've been deceived it puts me in a qu
such a shame they ruined it such a classic dish takes the fun out
my having a pizza night

[Verse 2]
they had to go add something that doesn
complement the flavors at all ru
it goes against everything pizza stands for
in my ever so humble opinion
its putting together
sweet and savory in a way
in a way that just does not work
it'd be like putting ran

[Verse 3]
and now iam stuck with a pizza that I cannot enjoy
there going perfect toppings such a sad
if only pineapple lovers could understand
or a least respect my viewpoint is not ask
ing for much just take it off the menu
and return pizza to its former
its former glory in my stomach that is where it belongs
and my tastebud will be happy once again it
so let this parody to you a and understand that
lets keep pineapple away from pizza can

[Outro]
we can all enjoy our
pie need our pizza the right way
keep those toppings separate
not confusion
pine
apple
bel
lies on
pizza
