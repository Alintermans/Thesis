[Verse 1]
have you considered the toppings
that should not be on a pizza crust was hoping that you
an pineapple does not belong near a
sausage or a pepperoni
do you ever get that feeling that it
just don't feel right like something is wrong sticking out
how many slices will it take
before you realize
a pineapple does not belong on a pizza tonight he
ugh its been lodged in my brain for too long thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
does this disgusting feeling go both ways do you
think ill ever feel okay with pineapple on a
like I'm suffering through some cruel clown
like ill ever be able to enjoy a pizza

[Chorus]
im crawling back to
the way that pizza used to
its calling me

not puttingthat
on your pie maybe
im too busy loving real
pizza to accept
copying over

[Verse 2]

and whether perhaps your taking lessonly

or maybe ill just stop by myself wondering which

think ill ever feel okay with pineapple on a
like I'm suffering through some cruel clown
like ill ever be able to enjoy a pizza
