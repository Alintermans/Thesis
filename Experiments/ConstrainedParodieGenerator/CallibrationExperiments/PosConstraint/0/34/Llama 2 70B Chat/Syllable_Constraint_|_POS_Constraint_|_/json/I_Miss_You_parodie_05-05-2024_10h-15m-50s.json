And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI crave you I\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\npinaci\nthat divine invention of\nthe sweet with a taste of an apple mix\nthe tropical pungeney\nof heat on the mountain mel\nits getting making with desire and so\nso my having sovere\nor it can burn likjee with zesty fier\nor as an additionon your rising\nits gets having an\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI want you you know you\nyou know I my\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere do you and my can just\nme go just love our king\nmy will choice or even maybe\nevery single\ntime might in in can every timnever\nand as my can its seem\nevery pie without\ncan something or make it iresists\nbecause lovesicknessand\nbut seems he person against\nadds his can share but can no b utom\nwill no nedsatief\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ncan not be your tima because they its was\nthe voice de he inside\nmy does my\n\ncan surely get it idea across\nthe heat with you ires\nme will you ires its\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ncan not be them time because its his was how\nthe voice Inside I\nits gets my my does what\n\nget very love it ideas with ires\nan take on\nmy be my my will you\n\ncan surely hear it ideas from\nan take in I ices\nits takes my my does what\n\nget very love it ideas that ires\nan add on me\nits makes my my will you\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nmy can I its\nits getting my its\nmy getting its my can\n",
