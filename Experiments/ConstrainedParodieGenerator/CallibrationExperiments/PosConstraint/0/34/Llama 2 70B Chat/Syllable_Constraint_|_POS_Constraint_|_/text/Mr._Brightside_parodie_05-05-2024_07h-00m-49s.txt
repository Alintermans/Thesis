[Verse]
keepin' pineapple off my pizza
gotta gotta keep it real it started with a
promise how did it end up like this it was only a
promise now I'm falling asleep and my stomach
is sick and it's all in my head spinning with the
thought of pineapple on my pizza instead cab
now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
while he's having a smoke

[Pre-Chorus]
but she'd touch his pizza now
he eats it himself now
let him go
because I just can't look its killing
me taking control

[Chorus]
blame townsendturnsaints
turns to hate when pineapple
aint around in your
but its are just another
pricey touristing
opening up my eager
on my will
