[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's a crime against humanity
it's like putting ketchup on a
a masterpiece artwork of flav
the cheese and sauce blend in perfect harmony

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza

[Verse 2]
you say you like the sweetness it brings
but to me it's a confusing
flavor clash that my tongue can't
it's like putting honey on a
on a juicy steak or ice cream on
a freshly baked pizza crust it's just not right

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza

[Verse 3]
I know some say it's a hawai
ian classic but to me it
it's a culinary abomination
a rose by any other name would still
be just as sweet but pineapple
on a pizza it's just not the same game bo

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza

[Verse 4]
I understand you have your own
opinion but to me it's a no
go zone putting pineapple on a pizza
it's like putting peanut butter
on a taco or ranch dressing
on caramelpopcorn it's just not something
