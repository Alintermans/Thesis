[Verse 1]
just stop your whining it's a pizza crimeand
get that pineapple off the
line welcome to the final slice
I hope yu looked at the toppings twice yu can't
bribe the chef on your way to
a stomach full of regret

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our toppings have
been here before why are we always stuck
with pineapple on top
we never change our pizza ways
we've been here before why are we running
from the flavor police

[Chorus]
just stop your whining it's a sign of the pie
we mustered up the courage to
order something new we gotta
get away from pineapple pizza we

been here before why are we always stuck
with pineapple on top

from the flavor police

[Chorus]

pineapple free pizza we got
