[Verse 1]
my stomach's got
a revulsion to pineapple on
top of a pizza that's divine sir
I should have thrown it out sooner
if the flavors ever
he heavens ever did
speak pineapple on pizza's
a fresh evil each week
we were fed sick you must it daily
they tell me pineapple goes well
with pepperoni and sausage in
bed but my tastebuds say no way
the only pizza I'll be
eating is one without that fruit
I was born with a taste

[Pre-Chorus]
a pizza
preaches amen

[Chorus]
make me a pie
I pay homage to the sanctuary of the
flavors combined are a lie show me your knife let
remove it from the menu
oh good pie let me give you
make me a pie
I play homage to the sanctuary of the
flavors combined are a lie show me your knife let
remove it from the menu
oh nice pie let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
if I'm the odd one that fresh toppings
my friendships's the
to pair this horror of me
my tastebudded
have a different demand take fresh
basil off b that the
a might that great stepfather
who you chose in the freezer
our are the pizza that time
this is hungry for is
a pizza without

[Chorus]
make me a pie
I worship to pay at the sanctuary of
your combined flavored whose a lie for me show me
remover it from the top
oh good pie give me eternal life
make me a pie
I worship to pay at the sanctuary of
your combined flavored whose a lie for me show me
use a different topping
oh good pie give me eternal life

[Bridge]
no critics and foodies when the real
flavors begin no one's around we're adults yes humans
on that marvelous and dirty in the modern
only then I enjoy victorious only then

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh pie oh
peach osita

[Chorus]
make me a pie
I pay homage to the sanctuary of the
flavors combined are a lie show me your knife let
remove it from the menu
oh good pie let me give you
make me a pie
I play homage to the sanctuary of the
flavors combined are a lie show me your knife let
remove it from the menu
oh nice pie let me give you my life
