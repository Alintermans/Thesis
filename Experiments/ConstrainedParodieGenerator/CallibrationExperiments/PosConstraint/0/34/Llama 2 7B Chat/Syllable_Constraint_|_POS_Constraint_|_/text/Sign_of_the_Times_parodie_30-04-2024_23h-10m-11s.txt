[Verse 1]
just stop your reaching for that pineapple pie
can't you see it doesn't
belong on a pizza so fine
it's a topping disaster waiting to happen
we gotta get away from
that sweet and savory sin

[Pre-Chorus]
we never should have tried placing it
there's no excuse for our mistake in
this peony that
you once thought was a pizza so bright
now it's a culinary crime scene in
the daylights that dance in

[Chorus]
just stop your reaching for that pineapple pie
it's clear that it doesn't belong
we have to say goodbye
to that topping of despair and longing
we gotta get away from there
it'll be alright when we do

[Verse 2]
back to the classics we must return with pride
finding our true pizza
identity won't
delayed gratification be denied
our tastebuds rejo
now long ago deified

[Pre-Chorus]
we never should have tried placing it
there's no excuse for our mistake in
this peony that
you once thought was a pizza so bright
now it's a culinary crime scene in
the daylights that dance in

[Chorus]
just stop your reaching we have to say goodbye
it'd different this time we
he pizza galactic
gotta get away from that pineapple pie
it's our of this world give it
its needed new home far away

[Pre-Chorus]
we never should have tried placing it
there's no excuse for our mistake in
this peony that
you once thought was a pizza so bright
now it's a culinary crime scene in
the daylights that dance in

[Bridge]
what happened here could have
been avoided had
in your ca any still
can you finally
we are giving
our sacred so

[Outro]
get away get away get away get away
our shared common
our shared commonality gone to our
our shared commonality done to our
our shared back
our shared away our
our shared away our be
