[Verse]
step away from the pineapple on my pizza pie
ain–≤t nobody got time for that tropical lie
it started off with a topping expectation ended
up in flames of disdain and regretfulness so
now my taste buds are in disarray and I can
feel my anger rising and my frustration mount
why pineapple gotta be on pizza when there
are so many other

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's cherried
it'll overpower
take my breath
or my so goes so does my will power
but won't someone

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on pizza jealousy
transforms toppings into un
fiery to in
but I refuse sovereig
payback is hellfire's me
can's I open wider eyes
for my pizza true

[Guitar Solo]
