[Verse 1]
my palate's gotta
hate for pineapple on a pizza
knew it'd ruin the flavor flow
should have banned it long ago if
the gods of taste had ever spoke
they'd forbid the nasty
fruit in every topping listo
every pie night gets
more disappointing each weeko we
were doomed with pine on our slice
they claim it pairswell with any dough
but I despise it with a passion
let me stick with pepperon
my sacred go тоo
was born with better taste

[Pre-Chorus]
a pity
thoughtlessness kills

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie and altar of delightful
cheeses baked to perfection you defilewith
take away that bitter taste
c'mon god let me enjoy this fe
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie and altar of delightful
cheeses baked to perfection you defilewith
take away that bitter taste
c'mon god let me enjoy this fe

[Verse 2]
if I advocategoodfood no
pineapple allowedst
to keep a quality above
its ruined every meal
adds an unnecessary sweetnes
feels off somehow in every
bite takes away from the joy
its what lets for a good slice
it can'tsatidyeatin any
these takeaway places gonna
disappoint again

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie and altar of delightful
cheeses baked to perfection you defilewith
take away that bitter taste
c'mon god let me enjoy this fe
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie and altar of delightful
cheeses baked to perfection you defilewith
take away that bitter taste
c'mon god let me enjoy this fe
