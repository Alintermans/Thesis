[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
my tastebuds scream in
wish I atedomino's
without this nasty trend

[Verse 1]
let me ponder on this thought a while for me conco
a reason to deride it
to justify my ire
do you check my critique posts
or snub my written
words in disapproving boasts decl
ine it's a warped desire
I tawk derogatorily on pineapple
behind closed doors it's clear won't
you admit yeastwrongdoinguesrtyingstillabominatinitafield
or my can furtheredstrife
take heed do not assertit
you just made me culinary miserable with
your fungus on my slice let me

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza pie I crave ouse
wish I could articulate why better than I do
this hatred can't abide it's true it's you ouch ouch true ouch true
my tastebuds scream in pain

[Verse 2]
you text my line saying pineapple
belongs on pizza near me homeward
I fear you to death and my willpower weak
within my very being oh how you
heedlessly ingested now
my tongue recalls your blunder it
in its mighty memory won
my willpower you bested

[Verse 3]
and I don't troll idiots that they're wrong debating
why pineapple belongs nah never would
though I yearn to admonish their takes it'd be
but a futile effort lost in a sea of
bickerearly cannednedged
and pineapvenomededhearted
your takes left me a wreck of a being ough ough ough
but my hatred ervedivedinedivedved
down canyeringedgingedgingnednedneddeddedged
eat me outta house and home leave me broke no

[Outro]
