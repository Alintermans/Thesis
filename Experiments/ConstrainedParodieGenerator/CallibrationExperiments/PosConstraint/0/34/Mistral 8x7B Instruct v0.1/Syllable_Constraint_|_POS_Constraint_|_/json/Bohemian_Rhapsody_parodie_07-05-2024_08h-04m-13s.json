Is this just fantasy?\nCaught in a landslide, no escape from reality\nOpen your eyes, look up to the skies and see\nI'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy\nBecause I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low\nAny way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me\n\n[Verse 1]\nMama, just killed a man\nPut a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead\nMama, life had just begun\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away\nMama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow\nCarry on, carry on as if nothing really matters\n\n[Verse 2]\nToo late, my time has come\nSends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time\nGoodbye, everybody, I've got to go\nGotta leave you all behind and face the truth\nMama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)\nI don't wanna die\nI sometimes wish I'd never been born at all\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI see a little silhouetto of a man\nScaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?\nThunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me\n(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico\nBut I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me\nHe's just a poor boy from a poor family\nSpare him his life from this monstrosity\nEasy come, easy go, will you let me go?\nBismillah! No, we will not let you go\n(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let me go) Will not let you go\n(Let me go) Will not let you go\n(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\n(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die?\nOh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!\nJust gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here\n[Outro]\n(Ooh)\n(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)\nNothing really matters, anyone can see\nNothing really matters\nNothing really matters to me\nAny way the wind blows [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro]\nis this a awful life trying pineapple\non a pizza slide no hope to flee reality\ntake a bite look down and see crust and cheese am\nI'm just a bold boy I need no\napology for hating pineapple on a pizza plate\nthe way it tastes don't really matter to me or to them who\n\n[Verse 1]\ntaste a slice and scream in\ndisgusting an innocent pizza stained pineapple was\nfoundry regret having thrown\ntaste away a perfect slice of pizza\nmother dear made a mistake to top it\nthat way carry on carry on like nothing\ntoppings on slices that in your hand actually res\n\n[Verse 2]\njustly prepared my sup\nshould have sticked to sausages and pepperoni\nfinale sorry my beloved pizza\ndream eaten alongside pineapple no more\nmother may I order another\nmy trusted pizza guy\nhe knows better than putting pineapple on\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI see some strange combinations of a meal\ncorn dog wedged inside a burger buns hell yeahh I call\nlettuce nor mayoned too so bland who they fooling I ight\ncheck foodies opinions ipsesities opinions yes ices icestersites ices ices\nbut I say just no to fruits decoration\nits supposed not a grand iceberg of a bad\nomeletea its gonna over\ngood iced sliced ried go iced igned my said take\naskananny spare it tomatoes not\nined my am yummy I get so put its\nshouldered my should nothing my am na shouldered it\nwashed my am ipped my been it\nshould my have beened so\nnever never forever outh have our aced\nthis this this this\nno no no no nah nonononnononononononono\noohhhhhhhhh irededredheadredheadreadheadheadheadreadredreadread\n\n[Verse 4]\nthen your ousing our acking telling our\nup our getting our ething eating his\nway way do ery making the up our\nonly ireddedrededgettinged ically\n\n[Outro]\noh\ngoddesses we\nmade so ries icans ive anced alledged\nmade so ries\ncan not anything ound\n",
