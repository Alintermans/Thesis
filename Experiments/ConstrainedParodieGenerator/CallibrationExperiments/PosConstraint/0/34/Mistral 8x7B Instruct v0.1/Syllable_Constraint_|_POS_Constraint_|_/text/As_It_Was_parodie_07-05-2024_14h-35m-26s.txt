[Intro]
come on audience, we wanna share our view

[Verse 1]
pineapple'
gravity's tells us
it shouldn't be on a pizza pie for sure
why allow it at all we must
resist this tempt
even if looking tasty it
with its sweet and savory
combination it does not belong there

[Chorus]
in this culinary
world it's just not fitting to see it
in this world it ruins
my beloved pizza pie completely
as it is in our
mythology it should

[Verse 2]
let's
analyze it logically
why add it can someone explain oh no
it waters down the flavor
destroys the
harmony of tomato and
mozzarella oh so fine
its just foolish to include pineapple we

[Chorus]
in this culinary
world it's just not fitting to see it
in this world it ruins
my beloved pizza pie completely
as it is in our
mythology it should

[Bridge]
give in move aside let others decide
its getting too annoying to even discuss it
compromising tradition for fleeting
trend is simply absurdity we cannot abide

[Outro]
yes
in our
hearts we know it should never go on
as it will never be
