[Verse 1]
now they say a pineapple's forlorn
on a pizza it should not be worn
but you don't really care for pizza do ya
it slices up the tastebud
and ruins the savory mood
a pineapple belongs on hawaiian food

[Chorus]
oh pineapple oh pineapple
oh pineapple oh pineapple

[Verse 2]
its flavor was strong and it looked fine
on a pizza it seemed divine
but its sweetness overthrew the pizza's fame
it ruled the cheese and tomato
they pleaded they'd rather not know it
and from their lips they uttered the grimacing

[Chorus]
oh pineapple oh pineapple
oh pineapple oh pineapple

[Verse 3]
they call it taking the slice in
but I don't understand the
reason for its banishment surely not us
there's a fire of disappointment at
their failed attempt at the pizza
all they utter is the grumbling hallel

[Chorus]
oh pineapple oh pineapple
oh pineapple oh pineapple

[Verse 4]
we thought we could make it just right
we sliced and added with all our
might but it turned out to be a fight standing
before the judge of pizza taste
we stood abandoned without a
chance of winning the pizza race and muttered

[Chorus]
alas pizza alas
cursed pineapple cursed pineapple
oh pineapple oh pineapple
oh pineapple oh pineapple
always pineapple always pine
curses on pineapple curses
oopsdiditagain pineal
lascurditus foreverom
ohoh curtseaofferusnowpi

[Outro]
disgruntlement oh disgrunt

[Additional Lyrics]
pizza my pied being here
my made this pizza my made known
its gone downhill since the pineapple was shown
and its given leave he place by the main
entr√©e will never be regained till
our beloved no longer bears its named no more

[Additional Lyrics]
a time when I let pineapple
us having not made that fatal
error of adding it to the pizzas we
or sharing again its been that long
no bite tastes remotest compared
to the halcyon days of enjoying pizza

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there ain't nothing
but a cold and broken pizza
chef once up said for funzarificly it
or its gone forever a memory
it might just be a broken pizza
he destroyed the great but its been the only way
