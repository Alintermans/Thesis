[Intro]
I hope i, I hope I clearly
see the error in the dish we
call a pizza topped with pineapple
it ain't rightful this ab
omina

[Verse]
I take a bite and want to we
retreat when I find that lingering sweetness weirdaleer
oh man it's purest hell the taste is
bleak if I could spit it out no would I he
d bake a supreme no pineap
ple on my plate and let it go and let it slide but ne
ver would I desecrate culinary
lore by placing it upon a pizza I adore now in
my grave I'll rot over it it
s almost freakish a sinful plot I'd never consi
der puttin' pineapple on pizza
with my bros eatin' it I'm wonderin' if
this is the be all and end all
and our shared sacred ambling for its am ending
once and for all please just let it end here
or I swear I will rot in my grave alone over it man

[Chorus]
in my grave I ro
t in my graver
over you insiders who
by it committer
in my gravereateri
over you insders

[Outro]
in my grave her
my pain is their pleasure
is it justice I pers
erved this for you foodies
enoy
