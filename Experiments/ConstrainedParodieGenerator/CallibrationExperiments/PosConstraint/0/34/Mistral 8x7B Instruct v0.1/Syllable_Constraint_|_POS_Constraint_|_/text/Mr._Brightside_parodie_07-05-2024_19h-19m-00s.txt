[Verse]
emerging from my den with dismay in sight traged
starts stirring up when pineapple'
what first seemed like a great idea ended up in a
mess like this it was only a topping option
now my tummy's in a twist as I watch them dev
with their slices of pizza with pineapple chunks
they're filling up on it while I'm filled with regret
and my mind is a mess

[Pre-Chorus]
but they've top'
they removed the veggies
take it off
it's driving me crazy seeing this ab
use of pineapple

[Chorus]
insult compounded by pineapple on
things'll only get worse when you
try to justify it with
but it shouldn't be allowed
tasteless is calling me out
mustering up my fullest
because it's sour

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
emerging from my den with dismay in sight tragedies
unavailability of pineappleless
what first seemed like a great idea ended up in a
disaster like this it was only a topping
now my tummy's In a twist as I
watch them devouring pizza with pineapple
they're filling up on it while I'm filled with regret
and my mind is a mess

[Pre-Chorus]
but they added pineapple
you coulda at least
removed the
indecency of pineapple on
but try to reason

[Chorus]
insult compounded by pineapple on
things'll only get worse when you
try to justify it with
but it shouldn't be allowed
tasteless is calling me out
mustering up my fullest
because it's sour

[Guitar Solo]


[Outro]
I never
