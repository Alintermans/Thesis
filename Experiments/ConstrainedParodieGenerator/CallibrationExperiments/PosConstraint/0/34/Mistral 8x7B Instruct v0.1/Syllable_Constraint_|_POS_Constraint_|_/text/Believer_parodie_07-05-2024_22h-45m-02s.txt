[Verse 1]
first things first
pizza topped with pineapples tastes so gross
it inflames my taste buds
an affront to dignity it
should never be allowed no way

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare tell me it's a
culinary delight
you can't be serious it'
just ain't right no way jose

[Pre-Chorus]
my beloved pizza dish no more
addicted to the taste I adore
loaded with cheese and tomato
but pineapples on top no no no go go go go
making me cringe with every
bite it just ain't right I can
take it no more no more no more
can't take it no more no more

[Chorus]
pineapple it put me off my feed
left hungering for
plain pizza instead no way no way
burning regret with each
bitetaking shame ican't believe it
I once thought it tasted finebut
pizza he divine I no
way let people order

[Verse 3]
third things third
praying for the day when pineapple
on pizza ends for good
spreadin' the truth to those who share my view
they're believers too no way no

[Pre-Chorus]
my beloved pizza dish no
more addicted to the taste I
adore loaded with cheese and tom
ato but pineapples on top
no no no go go go go making me cringe with ev
ery bite it just ain't right I can't take it no more
no more no more

[Chorus]
pineapple it put me off my feed
left hungering for
plain pizza instead no way no way
burning regret with each
bitetaking shame ican't believe it
I once thought it tasted finebut
pizza he divine I no
way let people order

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the power of the pizza gods and
my sacred taste buds at last
no pineapple on pizza
this sinful atrocity

[Pre-Chorus]
my beloved pizza dish no more addicted to the
taste I adore loaded with cheese and tomato but pineap
ples on top no

[Chorus]
pineapple it put me off my feed
left hungering for
plain pizza instead no way no way
burning regret with each
bitetaking shame ican't believe it
I once thought it tasted finebut
pizza he divine I no
way let people order
