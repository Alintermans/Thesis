just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
replace it with some pepper
it can't stay on
its slimy texture just isn't right on pizza
you can't deny the
truth I'm saying now ican

[Pre-Chorus]
we clearly see it doesn't belong
why keep inviting this ingredient
wrong and wrong again ort

why keep inviting this ingredient
the disdainful pine

[Chorus]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
it's ruining true pizza taste
it won't be back on again
drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
your taste buds will thank
you sincerest delight

[Verse 2]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
let marinara reign sup

again where everwhere

[Pre-Chorus]
we clearly see it doesn't belong
why keep inviting this ingredient
wrong and wrong again ort
we clearly see it doesn't belong
why keep inviting this ingredient
the disdainful pine

[Chorus]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
it'll ural be just as
we knew sweet sacred ore before
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
your ried it once it's had its chance

[Pre-Chorus]
