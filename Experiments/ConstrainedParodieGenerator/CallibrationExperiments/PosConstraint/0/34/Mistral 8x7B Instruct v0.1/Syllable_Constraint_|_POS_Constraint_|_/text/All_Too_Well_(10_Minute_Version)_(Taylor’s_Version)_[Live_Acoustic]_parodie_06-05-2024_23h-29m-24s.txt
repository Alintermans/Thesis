[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that piewith pineapple
my taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow
and that slimy chunk of fruit on my pizza
left a lingering taste of regret that won

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet temptation and my hesitant n
we took a slice that day unaware of the
strangeness overwhelming our tastebuds then
but now I see it clearer than beforehand

[Pre-Chorus]
and I don't understand
the reasoning going on
and my mouth may seem fine but it feels torn apart
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
because that's not how pizza's made sincerel
what even drove you to commit this culinary heres
ohhhhh on it truthfulness lies
I remember your mistake too

[Verse 3]
goldfish crackers on the side you said had came alivean
its was out of place next to sauce and mozzarellathen you wondered
why it tasted off compared to pepperonisqueezing le
mon juice on it won't save it from being wrongly
and I tried to wash away the taste forgot the flavor wasn
relishful bouts since this experience me
or my pizza have been the sameagain and again
he'll say it's fine but l know deep down you know it ain't
as we argue logic but can
come to agreement that adding pineapple
to a pizza ain't right
and so I question where our friendship's at its headed
and the what ledledgedleddededledled

[Pre-Chorus]
and I realize it changed right
these eating patterns neverright
but my will of what really truly is
pizza will never fadeaway

[Chorus]
since the first time that I tried it I knew it was
