He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a believer told it\nshould be forbidden on a\npizza pie ain't right to include it should be avoided\neven if you're a big spender gotta stick to the code\nwell little one I don't want\nto admit to something if all it will do is\nupset your stomach and\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe ordered pepperoni but they got it\npineapples on it instead of\nonions and mushrooms he can't stand\nbut he'll give it a chance and take a bite of it\nit might be an error his appetite in her\nhis heart's desire despite the flavor\nbut imagine his horror when he sees the can of it\nback where canned fruits belong not on top of a pizza he's appalled it\noffends him couldn't believe\nwhat she conceived so he'll leave it aside and instead he\ngrabs himself a slice of pizza without the pine\ncompares the two in his mind he knows which one is divine\nin his opinionated view\nsave the pineapple for the fruit bowl not the pizza\nor his taste buds will hate you \u00f3r treat you rude \u00f3r his stomach will\ndisown you or his moody attitude change\nfor the bad ohhhpineapplecanehas\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a denier\nof pineapple on pizza\nno matter what anyone thinks I say its written in stone\nwhy ruin a classic with a tropical sensation\non a pizza intended for\na gathering or I party only\ntomato sauce and cheese\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nsome people swear by it but I think they\nlost their mind they just don't know any better\nthey like to experiment with their pizza\nin their faces sometimes we we look them right\nin the eyes like they've committed a pizza crime they\njust don't see it the way we view it better off\nfinding better fruit to put on top of your pizza pop\ntake a mango or a strawberry instead of pineapple popping up\nwhen they open up a pizza without fail surprising someone pop\ngoes the pineapple and ruins the meal\nits always hidden in the shadows they I tried to\nwarn them don't you underestimate the power of pine\nor else you'll regret your decision saying\nokay forget it I'm just going to\nmake my own pizza from scratch without\nadding any pineapple messing with the batch\ntryna but cant do have\nonly enough\nroom for tomato sauce and cheese on my plate\nto avoid pineapples from my fate in my personal space\ndon\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nyou'll never catch me dead\nconsum\nig\nepinap\nplingeddinggedgedging\nnot today or any other day\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nif you're a true lover of pizza don\nt make the same mistake thinking pineap\non pizza will make it taste better know being deceived\npizza with pineapple on top is a sin greater\nthe ills of our society can\nit can only make it worse\nand your adding to the problem spreading\nthe curse telling everyone you know to order\nit giving ampededampedenedded\nideas its just going to get\nway far more out of hand and make your taste bud\nyour encedeneddedendedenedded\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI don't want to admit to\nthat pineapple on pizza\nno matter what you think I say its wrong in my opinion\nwell little one\nits going\n\nmy proposed parody follows the same\nstructure as\n\nof the original song in\nboth lines and syllables number of syllables\n",
