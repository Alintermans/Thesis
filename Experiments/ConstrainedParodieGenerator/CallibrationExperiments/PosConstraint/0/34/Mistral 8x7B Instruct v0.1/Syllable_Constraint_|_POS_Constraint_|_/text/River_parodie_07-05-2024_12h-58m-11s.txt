[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a believer told it
should be forbidden on a
pizza pie ain't right to include it should be avoided
even if you're a big spender gotta stick to the code
well little one I don't want
to admit to something if all it will do is
upset your stomach and

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he ordered pepperoni but they got it
pineapples on it instead of
onions and mushrooms he can't stand
but he'll give it a chance and take a bite of it
it might be an error his appetite in her
his heart's desire despite the flavor
but imagine his horror when he sees the can of it
back where canned fruits belong not on top of a pizza he's appalled it
offends him couldn't believe
what she conceived so he'll leave it aside and instead he
grabs himself a slice of pizza without the pine
compares the two in his mind he knows which one is divine
in his opinionated view
save the pineapple for the fruit bowl not the pizza
or his taste buds will hate you ór treat you rude ór his stomach will
disown you or his moody attitude change
for the bad ohhhpineapplecanehas

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a denier
of pineapple on pizza
no matter what anyone thinks I say its written in stone
why ruin a classic with a tropical sensation
on a pizza intended for
a gathering or I party only
tomato sauce and cheese

[Verse 2: Eminem]
some people swear by it but I think they
lost their mind they just don't know any better
they like to experiment with their pizza
in their faces sometimes we we look them right
in the eyes like they've committed a pizza crime they
just don't see it the way we view it better off
finding better fruit to put on top of your pizza pop
take a mango or a strawberry instead of pineapple popping up
when they open up a pizza without fail surprising someone pop
goes the pineapple and ruins the meal
its always hidden in the shadows they I tried to
warn them don't you underestimate the power of pine
or else you'll regret your decision saying
okay forget it I'm just going to
make my own pizza from scratch without
adding any pineapple messing with the batch
tryna but cant do have
only enough
room for tomato sauce and cheese on my plate
to avoid pineapples from my fate in my personal space
don

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a denier
of pineapple on pizza
no matter what anyone thinks I say its written in stone
why ruin a classic with a tropical sensation
on a pizza intended for
a gathering or I party only
tomato sauce and cheese

[Verse 3: Eminem]
if you're a true lover of pizza don
t make the same mistake thinking pineap
on pizza will make it taste better know being deceived
pizza with pineapple on top is a sin greater
the ills of our society can
it can only make it worse
and your adding to the problem spreading
the curse telling everyone you know to order

I don't want to admit to
that pineapple on pizza
no matter what you think I say its wrong in my opinion
well little one

structure as
of the original song in
both lines and syllables number of syllables
