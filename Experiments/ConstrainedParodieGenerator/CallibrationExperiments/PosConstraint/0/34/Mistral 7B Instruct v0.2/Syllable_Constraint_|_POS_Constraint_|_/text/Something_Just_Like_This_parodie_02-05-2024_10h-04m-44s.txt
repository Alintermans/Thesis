[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been considering trends
a tale of modern life
tiktok and your memes
pinterest and its slice
pi√±a colada
pizza with pineapple
but surely I don't want that on my menu's list

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she remarked casually
where's your culinary
I'm not cravingsomething with
pineapple on its spicy
an appetizer
an innovative
just something simple balanced
blandishnotative
I desire something so

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
something I adores
pine apple off stage
somethimg consistent
oh we does not always like that
nono I want something
unique deconstrose
farm grown organic plant
something I can plant again oh
it'd be so delicious

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I ponder eating sched
the evolution of
a variety of
a tastebudsprobe
and pepper versus cream
an umamination
but I'm not a fusionpersonality

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she querened curiously
where's your preferred cuisine
