[Verse 1]
I threw open the door with a pineapple
but something about it was in grave error
and I wish I'd never left it there on your
pizza pie that night or even tomorrow

[Verse 2]
oh your excited anticipation and my puzz
ed frown we were debating in the kitchen
autumn left abandoned apples falling down like
wasted opportunities in the binning

[Pre-Chorus]
and I knew it seemed absurd
but tradition said it just
belonged on a hawaiian delight or a ham
oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we were once on that controversial plate
we argued left and right with heated debate essentialsate
pie around me cheesiness
you remembered our all too

[Verse 3]
crammedfull photo album on refrigerator door
your determined face was turning sour disappointment within force
and your brother's asking bout that weirdest of all dish I care
your telling me about your long family his tale
and you wanted love it seemed beneath mere toppings changed mine role
pie cuttable in every kitchen your willed
but you forgot forgetton by all tastes'allure
your saying fairness didn't matter it wasn't my call
until your serving empty plates
did you wonder where it went to as I reached
for one pineapple on the
but only your raised yet my ire up in your eyes bore me
but all I tasted left disgust and your faced weary

[Pre-Chorus]
and we shrugged our shoulders
no amused reply why
and we carried on our never quite
the same again our ending

[Chorus]
'cause that's the way we were once on a culinary
our heated heated pasta dispute resolution in
on that savory stage
our arguing our all
but the me made entirely differently pitas
our heated heated pasta dispute resolution
pizza dough or
our heated heated pasta all

[Bridge]
well maybe it didn't suit everyone
just my acquired tasteful
but maybe it was meant to be something
than what ended up
making wasted our
our heated heated pasta
our heated heated pasta all too welllyellyellyelly
on that savory stage our heated heated pasta all
our heatedheadedheadedheadedheaded
