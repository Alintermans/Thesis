[Verse 1]
once the hawaii went
pineapple on a paletten
our beloved pizza then
your taste rejected

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to five hundred attempts experiments
you ordered me tonight but I'm beyond unexpected tastes
you yearn for my cheese before our harmony's an ending
your palate searches for gusto to replace that pineapple's

[Chorus]
was it over where the pineapple touched the
was it over where our sauce it inter
I just whispered remove it from
within your dream of your rejected
was it over then and flavorsomehow
