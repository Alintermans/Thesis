[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our beloved pizza dish
I savor every bite with
an uncontrollable

[Verse 1]
give me a minute or two to justifywhy on
earth it's on pizza tonight
do you read my recipes
or dismiss them hastyly
when you said it was trendy and
there'd be no taste regretfully
I knew when I asked you to
heed my pleas and keep it offthe toppings you chose to
do the opposite of what you vowed to
our beloved palate's betrayedso if you really wanna know
and I'm growing tired of
being the oddball in the
it's supposed to be about our lovebut you
just like it more with pineapple

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on it here it tastes better
we can savor every bite together without
wishing it wasn't there bitterlybut I can't explain it
my beloved pizza might seem

[Verse 2]
it slides in when we least expect it
littering up our pizza with
its juicy sweetness that agitates and
overpowers every other taste
I don't
our sacred pizza should be
like our shared longinglyonly
my beloved pizza covered

[Verse 3]
and I resist the temptation to rant about it on
social media platformsi share the
for the sakeofourmemoriesbeaten downby
the intrusion of your pineapplecraving
so save the time I don't havewaste
but put aside hatred asideoff
our beloved pizza our memoriesare memories
but I can talk abouthow many timesattract
how many times it arrived on timebut I'd have an
toppleso we shut out our friendsfor you

[Outro]

pizza is your confusing takeon
let this be ours alone
