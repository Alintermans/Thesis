[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pinefor you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
ellopi
an invader from
a kitchen at dinner party near me
a topian tantalizer
of pizza's sweet
allure in the aisle at the grocery store
we can live together love
but pineapple on pizza ruins
and with every bite we take sharing
it changes our bond

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pinefer you it
I pinefer you it

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where are you and your beloved ham
my beloved palate won't allow me
its am algamelation and
a mysterious
trickiness is overpowering like canning
but with each failed attempt tried
all varieties under
are blandder than expected I find
as I stare at the pineapple
but will it taste of justice
please remove it from my pizza tonight
make it right tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
do not put it there for me you're already
an enemy within
my beloved tastebud
do not put it there for me you're already
an enemy within
my desired delight

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
do not put it there for me you're already
an enemy within
my desired delight
do not put it there for me you're already
an enemy within
my desired delight
do not put it there for me you're already
an enemy within
my desired delight
do not put it there for me you're already
an enemy within
my desired delight

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pinefer you it
I pineference you
it could be us sharing
it should be us
