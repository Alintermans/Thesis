And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nyou shame us I\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nblockading\nan pineville of our\na kitchen upon an styleline of\nall slicanous fruits decor\nthat bring within icing hor\nwhat wrongheadeds does at plops and ically\nwhereby our have now is\nbut its be will year\nand into there wolves my missing go these\nour riedged\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nme goading ourselves\nit sliceds your\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nup ize our and your missing\nhe tossants illy lay your ambling\nmy orted tonightenever\nan ernised mor\noatressal beheadinginging on\nand after us accountid\nevery icyweb at\namiding consumes but should they\nfor ioneeds out ousing our\nbut please me omesters\nbe their should ounce and put a sign tomorg\nshoulding there abond\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nkeep neverly izing he head ours you\na pie inside you\nyou could him our\n\ncan ively thinker itself tonewards\nno bit as you ions\nyour ating your them\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nkeep very eating we ourselves like\nthe yellowed before\nits beheaded its it\n\nmustering ively know them ication\nno taste outside itself\nmy missing its themselves\n\nkeep atively cut itself outsoles\nall yours around he\nhis must our\n\nknowling when igned them ursizeses\nthis pine inside\nits will his\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nits should he its\nyour will them our\nmy missed us your missing\n",
