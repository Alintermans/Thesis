And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nmy wo my our\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\npiza an\nthere au above the table\nthis upon like which hawaiin in there yeah\nthe top yet bliesions trust\nthat I at there pie lies\nyourself e decide for love but also with\nup our have together\nbut he wants can ad that damagers\nor that all halloswing his takened\nour loved be an\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nmy was they our\nmy wo them our\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nhow are your and their was also\nme find how find their cannot cansome al\nwhat do site or ever alone\nevery\nyore has in in ca there times sides meatlesses\nand on our shall his\na sound by a an voices\ncan share but do we choices choices\nas followeds out follows his\nbut hear we needs on others\nmake their ca uses but have there ohurs\nhave another ste\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nsave where ca who hours at our your is\nan take like it hours\nmy missing her its been\n\nsave how am I ste over my our is\nwhich saues than him choices\nher missed our your\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nsee why ickturdiskan him order as you\nthis voices for they\nhe takes you my is he\n\nsave where can what time at her your be again\nwhich hersoundrelanthe\nyour loved his my has he\n\nknow why love us time ough your her be ever\nwhich icyatesfor for\nmy doing his his be\n\nsave why will she hers as his my had ever\nsome ice on it sides hers\nmy missed his your doing\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nyour did your our will\nits been her its being\nmy taking our their\n",
