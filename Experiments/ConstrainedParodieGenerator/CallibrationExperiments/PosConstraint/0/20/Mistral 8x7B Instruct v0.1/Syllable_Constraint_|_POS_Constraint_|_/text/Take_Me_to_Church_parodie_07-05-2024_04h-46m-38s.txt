[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go ical error
pineapple should not be there I warn
her ordered extra cheese instead
if the pizza ever did speak
she's the last true master
every bite's gettin
more regrettable a
fresh embarrassment each bite we take
we were born with taste buds not to
mistake sweet for savory delight
she tells me pineapple's a sinful
plight on my pizza tonight
I was born with discerning taste
don't tell me to eat

[Pre-Chorus]
a pepper
oni it's not

[Chorus]
take me back to
my pizza without pineapple's lies I prayed for
I'll tell you my taste preference and you can toss
the abomination in
the bin good god let me enjoy this
take me back
my pizza without pineapple's lies I prayed for
I'll tell you my taste preference and you can toss
the abomination in
the bin good god let me enjoy this

[Verse 2]
if I'm a lover of the classic
toppings then pineapple
is a sacrilegious act to
meat and veggie alike drain
the whole joy of eating pizza just
to find a sweet intrusion that
looks out of place among the
other toppings on my plate
we've got a lot of loyal fans
that'll turn away in disgust
this is culinar

[Chorus]
take me back to
my pizza without pineapple's lies I prayed for
I'll tell you my taste preference and you can toss
the abomination in
the bin good god let me enjoy this
take me back to
my pizza without pineapple's lies I prayed for
I'll tell you my taste preference and you can toss
the abomination in
the bin good god let me enjoy this

[Bridge]
no pineapple or ham when the feast begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
in the madness and joy of that savory scene
only then I am satisfied only then I am

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh pepper
oni it's not

[Chorus]
take me back to
my pizza without pineapple's lies I prayed for
I'll tell you my taste preference and you can toss
the abomination in
the bin good god let me enjoy this
take me back
my pizza without pineapple's lies I prayed for
I'll tell you my taste preference and you can toss
the abomination in
the bin good god let me enjoy this
