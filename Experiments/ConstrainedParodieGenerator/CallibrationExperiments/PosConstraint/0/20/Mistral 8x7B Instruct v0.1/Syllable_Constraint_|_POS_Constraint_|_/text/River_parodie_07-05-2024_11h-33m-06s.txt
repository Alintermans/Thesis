[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies now are falling like the rain so
let the river run juice

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his slice in hand met with
disgust and a glare from his fam
says it's a sin but he just can't
resist the temptation to add pineapple to
his pizza again and again he knows it's a
mistake but he just can't seem to refr
ain from the sweet and tangy taste of pineapple on his
pizza again he knows it's a messy situation but he just
can't seem to get enough
and his loved ones say it's time to give up the habit but
he's addicted to the sweet and sour combo
and he just can't seem to stop himself from adding pine
apple to his pizza again
against all better judgment he just can't seem to
help himself from indulging in this forbidden fruit on his pie
and he knows it's wrong but he just can't seem
to resist the temptation to add pine

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies now are falling like the rain so
let the river run juice

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a classic margherita turned
a pineapple pizza it was love at first bite
but now he's realized the error of his ways
and he's trying to turn back time but the taste
of pineapple on his tongue lingers on he knows he
shouldn't have added the sweet fruit to his pizza but
he just couldn't resist the temptation to try something
new he knows it's not the traditional way to enjoy a slice but he
just can't seem to help himself from indulging in this forbidden
fruit on his pie and now he's paying the
price for his mistake he knows he should have stuck to the
classics but the sweet and tangy taste of pineapple on his
pizza was just too hard to resist and now
he's regretting his decision to add
pineapple to his pizza against
all better judgment he just can't seem to help
himself from indulging in this forbid
den fruit on his pie and
he knows it's not the right choice but he just can
't seem to resist the temptation to add pineapple to his
pie

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
