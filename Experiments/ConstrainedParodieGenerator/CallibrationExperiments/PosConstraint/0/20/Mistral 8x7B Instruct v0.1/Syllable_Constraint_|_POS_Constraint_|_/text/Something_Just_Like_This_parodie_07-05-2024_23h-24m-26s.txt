[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni and cheese
but pineapple just won
through reputation
it doesn't deserve to
be on a pizza pie like this one does belong here

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said taste is subjective
and I can't deny
I'm not looking for a topping
that will make me wonderwhy
it's on my pizza
underneath the cheese
just something to enhance the
flavor I can se
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doodododododo
doodododoo do
doodododododo
oh I want something just like this
doodododododo
doodododoo do
doodododododo
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
but pineapple just won
through reputation it
doesn't deserve to be
on a pizza pie like
this one does not belong here at all no way

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said taste is subjective
and I can't deny
I'm not looking for a topping
that will make me wonderwhy
it's on my pizza
underneath the cheese
just something to enhance the
flavor I can se

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doodododododo
doodododoo do
doodododododo
oh I want something just like this
doodododododo
doodododoo do
doodododododo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a topping
that will make me wonderwhy
it's on my pizza
underneath the cheese
just something I can turn to
somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
