[Intro]
I think I've tried and tried again now
to find a way to justify
the topping choice I hate with passion
I guess that's the first step right
you agree

[Verse]
I've tasted pine on pizza pie
can't pretend it's something I'd desire oh my god
what a world where this is allowed to
exist I ask myself would I partake or
some like sweet and savory mixed
but I would rather leave it off and eat the rest alone
for taste preferences clash and cause a
fuss I don't wanna partake I'll just refuse I've
tasted pine on pizza pie and
can't pretend it's something I'd desire oh my god
what a world where this is allowed to
exist I ask myself would I partake or
some like sweet and savory mixed
but I would rather leave it off and eat the rest alone
for taste preferences clash and cause a
fuss I don't wanna partake I'll just refuse I'll rot in

[Chorus]
in my stomach it
will rot it will rot
in my stomach it will rot
in my stomach it
will rot it will rot rot rot
in my stomach it

[Outro]
in my stomach it
will rot I'll rot I'll rot
is my discomfort your
pleasure is all of my pain your
pleasure
