[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottles in hand looking so divine start
it started out with a slice now my stomach is in a
wad of regret and heartburn from this culprit so
vilely designed now I'm lying down with a
groan as my body's rejecting pineapple on
my pizza again it's all in my head and it
haunts me in my sleep like

[Pre-Chorus]
a poisonous curse now it
burns like a curse now let
me be free
'cause I just can't
stomach it no more

[Chorus]
jealousy of those who can partake in
delights of pineapple on
pizza with no ill effects
but it's just the price I pay
fate has no pity for me
cursed with a sensitive gut
'cause I'm mr sour

[Guitar Solo]
