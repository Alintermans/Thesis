He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine time and time\nall my sins need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\ntruth and my lies now are falling like the rain so\nlet the river run juice\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with his slice in hand met with\ndisgust and a glare from his fam\nsays it's a sin but he just can't\nresist the temptation to add pineapple to\nhis pizza again and again he knows it's a\nmistake but he just can't seem to refr\nain from the sweet and tangy taste of pineapple on his\npizza again he knows it's a messy situation but he just\ncan't seem to get enough\nand his loved ones say it's time to give up the habit but\nhe's addicted to the sweet and sour combo\nand he just can't seem to stop himself from adding pine\napple to his pizza again\nagainst all better judgment he just can't seem to\nhelp himself from indulging in this forbidden fruit on his pie\nand he knows it's wrong but he just can't seem\nto resist the temptation to add pine\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine time and time\nall my sins need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\ntruth and my lies now are falling like the rain so\nlet the river run juice\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na classic margherita turned\na pineapple pizza it was love at first bite\nbut now he's realized the error of his ways\nand he's trying to turn back time but the taste\nof pineapple on his tongue lingers on he knows he\nshouldn't have added the sweet fruit to his pizza but\nhe just couldn't resist the temptation to try something\nnew he knows it's not the traditional way to enjoy a slice but he\njust can't seem to help himself from indulging in this forbidden\nfruit on his pie and now he's paying the\nprice for his mistake he knows he should have stuck to the\nclassics but the sweet and tangy taste of pineapple on his\npizza was just too hard to resist and now\nhe's regretting his decision to add\npineapple to his pizza against\nall better judgment he just can't seem to help\nhimself from indulging in this forbid\nden fruit on his pie and\nhe knows it's not the right choice but he just can\n't seem to resist the temptation to add pineapple to his\npie\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's juice my name\nis juice\ncall\nme juice we\n'll let the river run juice\nagainst all better judgment he just\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the traditionalist never\nthe one to try something new but now he\n's given in to the temptation of pineapple on his\npizza and he's regretting it he knows it's not the\nright choice but he just can't seem to help\nhimself from indulging in\nthis forbidden fruit on his pie and now\nhe's paying the price for his mistake he knows he\nshould have stuck to the classics but the sweet and\ntangy taste of pineapple on his\npizza was just too hard to resist and now\nhe's regretting his decision to add pine\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine time and time\nall my sins need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\n's gonna cause is pain the truth and\nmy lies now are falling like the rain so let the\n",
