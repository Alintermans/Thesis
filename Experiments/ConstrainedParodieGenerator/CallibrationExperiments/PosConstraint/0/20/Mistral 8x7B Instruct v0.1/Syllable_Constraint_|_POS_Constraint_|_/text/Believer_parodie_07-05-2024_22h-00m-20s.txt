[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on my pizza
I won't stand for it no more
it's a culinary crisis
a gastronomic

[Verse 2]
second things second
ham and pineapple's a combo absurdly que
I'll stick to my pepper
I'm the master of my pizza dream
my pizza scheme is true blue hey

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on pies with cheese and
tomato sauce and herbs and spices
writing my poems for the few
that look at me and say yuck to pineapple slices
singing my lesson from the brain
seeing the beauty in a plain
cheese and tomato base again
no sweet and savory mix up

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer in
pineapple free pizza
pain you break me down and build me up
believer in
pain you made me a believer in
pineapple free pizza hey yeah yeah
pain you made me a believer in
pineapple free pizza

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the ones up above
all the pineapple on
pizzas is an act of love or so they
claim but I don't buy it no

[Pre-Chorus]
I was chokin' in the crowd
buildin' my hate for pineapple
falling like ashes to the
ground hoping my feelin's they would
drown but they never did ever lived ebbin' and flow
inhibited limited till it broke open and rained down
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer in
pineapple free pizza
pain you break me down and build me up
believer in
pain you made me a believer in
pineapple free pizza hey yeah yeah
pain you made me a believer in
pineapple free pizza

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the pizza gods above
you're the face of the future
the blood in my pizza ve
ins oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ever lived ebbin' and flowin
inhibited limited till it broke open and rained down
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer in
pineapple free pizza
pain you break me down and build me up
believer in
pain you made me a believer in
pineapple free pizza hey yeah yeah
pain you made me a believer in
pineapple free pizza
