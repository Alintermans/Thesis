[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my appetite at the table
that monstrosity should not be allowed now

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet deception and my misguided taste bud
we're arguing in the kitchen like two fool
hammered by the taste of pineapple chunks in the
pizza sauce congealing like a cruel rule

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's a mistake
but I'm still reaching for a
slice of pizza that's not meant to be mine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that cheesy
slice of pizza that should never be served with easeinessi
n my mouth it lingers on
I regret it all too well now

[Verse 3]
toppings scattered on the counter your taste preferences
we're clashing in disagreement on what makes pizza divinebut
you're still insisting on the sweetness of pineapples in the
mix and I'm cringing every time you take a bite
and you say it's a delicacy but I can't deny
the bitter taste of disappointment in my mouth
and you wonder why I push it aside and say it
should never be on a pizza but you just laugh it off
as if I'm being too picky
but I can't help but remember it all
too well now as I watch you
take another bite and I can't believe it all too
well now as I turn away and let you enjoy it

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's a mistake
but I'm still reaching for a slice
of pizza that's not meant to be mine at
all oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that cheesy slice of pie
I regret it all too well now as I watch you enjoy it
with every bite it
sickens me to see it all too
well now as I turn away and let you enjoy it
I regret it all too well now as I watch you enjoy
it with every bite
I regret it all too well now as

[Bridge]
maybe we just have different tastes in
food maybe I asked for too
much but a pizza with pineapple is
a culinary
disaster I can't
believe it I regret it all
too well now as I watch you enjoy it with every bite
I regret it all too well now as I watch you enjoy it
with every bite I regret it all too well
now as I turn away and let

[Verse 4]
I thought we had something special but then you added
pineapple and it all fell apart and
I can't help but wonder if you ever truly cared for pizza
or if you just wanted to
watch me suffer through every bite I took
I remember the first time we shared a pizza and it was perfect but
then you added pineapple and it
was ruined forever I can't help
but remember it
all too well now as I watch you enjoy it
with every bite I regret it all too well
now as I turn away and let you enjoy it with every
bite I regret it all too well now as I watch you eat

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'
m paralyzed by the taste of pineapple on my tongue I'd like to
go back to the time before you added pineapple
and we could share a pizza without regret but
you still have that slice of pizza with pineapple
that I left behind and it reminds you of the taste
of pineapple on pizza
and you can't get rid of it

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that cheesy slice
I regret it all too well now as I watch you eat
it with every bite
I regret it all too well now
as I turn away and let
you enjoy it with a
bite I regret it all
too well now as I watch
you eat it with a bite
I regret it all too well now

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at eating pizza with pineapple
but the taste of it still lingers on my tongue
and I'm still trying to forget the taste
of pineapple on pizza but I can't
help but remember it all too well
just between us I regret it all too well now
as I watch you enjoy it
with every bite I regret it all
too well now as I turn away
and let you enjoy it with a

[Outro]
I regret it all too well now as I watch you enjoy
it with every bite I regret it all too well
now as I turn away and let you enjoy it with every
bite I regret it all too well now as
I watch you enjoy it with a bite
I regret it all too well now as
I watch you enjoy it with a bite I just
can't believe it I regret it all
too well now as I watch you enjoy
it with every bite I regret
it all too well now as I turn
away and let you enjoy it with a
bite I regret it all too well now
as I watch you enjoy it with a
bite I regret it all too well
now as I turn away and let you eat
it with a bite I regret it all
too well now as I watch you enjoy
it with a bite I regret it all too well

[Spoken Outro]
I regret it all too
