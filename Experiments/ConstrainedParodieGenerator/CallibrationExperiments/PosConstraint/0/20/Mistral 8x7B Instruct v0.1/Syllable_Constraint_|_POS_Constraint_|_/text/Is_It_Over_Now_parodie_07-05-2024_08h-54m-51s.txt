[Intro]
pineapple on pizza pie oh say is

[Verse 1]
once the box was opened wide
cheese and sauce mixed with pineapple
taste and flavor took a dive
your hunger still not

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later I see
your plate with disappointment and dismay upon your face so
you dream of my pizza before it ruined your tastebud
you search for a slice that's better baby believe me it's no good

[Chorus]
was it over when you took your first bite oh
was it over when you spit it out
I said never put pineapple
on a pizza again baby it
won't work out now or evermore it's true

[Post-Chorus]
pineapple on pizza

[Verse 2]
when you lost your appetite
ham and mushrooms ruined
tomato sauce tainted with
sweet pineapple absurd

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the look of disgust
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza choices
off of your plate and away from your
disapproving gaze
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred awkward pizza nights later
if it's got pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably never date
her you dream of a slice before it ruined your appetite oh
you search for a pizza without it for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when you took your first bite oh
was it over when you spit it out baby
I said never put pineapple
on a pizza again it won't
work out now or evermore it's true now or

[Post-Chorus]
pineap
pineapple on pizza
no no
pineapple on

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
the look of disgust
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza choices
off of your plate and away from your
disapproving gaze
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come running baby
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Outro]
pineapple on pizza
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizzas later
pineapple on pizza I was hoping
you'd come to your senses and
say the one thing I've been
wanting
pineapple on pizza no no no no no no
