[Intro]
is this a bad pie coming from pure deceit
pineapple on pizza making us all take a seat
look at this monstrosity served upon your
plate and plate and plate again and again it
comes and comes and comes and comes again and again it comes and
comes and comes and comes again and again it comes and comes and comes

[Verse 1]
papa just ruined a
classic margherita with fruit on top he's a fool who
doesn't understand the art
of pizza making he just doesn't care
papa don't you know that pineapple
doesn't belong on a pizza pie it's a
travesty that should not be allowed to fly fly fly high

[Verse 2]
too late my pizza's gone
tainted by the taste of sweet and savory combined
goodbye to my beloved pizza pie I
knew it all along that pineapple was a
crime but I took a bite and now it
cannot be undone it
tastes so wrong and I can't deny that it
