I despise it, I desp

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on pizza's scandalized cul
inary scandalizing our taste
buds' sensibilities they

togetherness in every bite we
savor without regret

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
pizza pie it just does not bel
ong there it's a sweet and savory mess
with ham and pineapple combined
a sacrilegious
blend that makes my stomach turn inside out like
a pretzel knotted up in
anguish and despair I'd much
rather have a pepperoni slice
than endure this sugary ab
omination any day
please keep your pineapple off my pizza
off my pizza please

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your sweetness to my meal you're al
ready a disaster
I despise it I desp
is pineapple on pizza a disaster
I despise it I desp
is pineapple on a

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your sweetness to my meal you're al
ready a disaster
I despise it I desp
is pineapple on pizza a disaster
I despise it I desp
is pineapple on a
disaster I despise it I despise it
I despise it I desp
is pineapple on a
disaster I despise it I despise it
I despise it I desp
is pineapple on a

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
is pineapple on a
I despise it I desp
is pineapple on a
