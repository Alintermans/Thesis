[Intro]
come on now folks let's share our viewpoint on the

[Verse 1]
pineapple's
gravity's pull is quite un
believable on a pizza base so grand
why don't we just ban it from
our plates and
be content with other toppings
it can't be replaced and
we'll all be better off in the land of

[Chorus]
our world without pine
you know it's not the same as it was
in our world without
pineapple it's a new trend as it
was as it was you know
it's not the same any

[Verse 2]
call the chef tell
him pineapple's got no place
on a pizza base so fine and round so
what's the point of adding it
ring the alarm
but don't expect any help
it's a lost cause so let it
rest in peace and let the pizza be whole once

[Chorus]
our world without pine
you know it's not the same as it was
in our world without
pineapple it's a new trend as it
was as it was you know
it's not the same any

[Bridge]
go home and make your own pizza without
pineapple and don't let anyone tell you it
was ever a good idea to mix
sweet and savory in one dish like that go ahead

[Outro]
as
our world
without pineapple is a better
place as it was as it
