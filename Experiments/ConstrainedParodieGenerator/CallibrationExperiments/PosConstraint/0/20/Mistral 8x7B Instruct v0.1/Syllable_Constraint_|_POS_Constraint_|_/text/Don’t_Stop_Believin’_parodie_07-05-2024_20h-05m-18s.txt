[Verse 1]
just a small town slicefar from a pineapple
a classic pie with cheese and pepperoni
but then a monster came with its top so vile
adding fruit to pizza miles away from home

[Verse 2]
a chef in a greasy kitchen
the smell of dough and tomato
for a bite they can share the night
it's a sin that goes on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights glow
their cravings searchin'
for the taste they
used to know oh no no no no
don't add pineapple to

[Verse 3]
working hard to keep it pure
pizza should never be imp
paying anything to keep it fine
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will love the classic
some will hate the new trendy
oh the outrage never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights glow
their cravings searchin'
for the taste they
used to know oh no no no no
don't add pineapple to

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that pizza
streetlights people
don't stop believing
hold on
streetlights people
don't stop believing
hold on to that pizza
streetlights people
