[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice foot
now in the morning I take a bite
of a pizza that just ain

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to love the taste
but now it's ruined by the pineap
stuck in every bite like
a thorn in my side I can't escape
one bite in and I feel bet
the sweetness turned to regret
and I discovered that my crust is soft
upon a base of bad decisions aloft

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
pizza lovers voices singing low
be my comfort food and solace
but pineapple on a pizza I won
for some reason I can't comprehe
why pineapple on a slice
but that was when I ate
pizza with pineapple on it

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a terrible mistake
to put pineapple on my plate
shattered taste buds and the sound of scream
people couldn't believe what I'd create
revolutionaries wait
for my apology and a
pizza with no pineapple on a silver
plate just a man on a lonely plate

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
pizza lovers voices singing low
be my comfort food and solace
but pineapple on a pizza I won
for some reason I can't comprehe
why pineapple on a slice but that was
when I ate pizza with
pineapple on it nevermore

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
hear the bells of disappointment ring
oh no oh no oh no
pizza lovers voices singing low
oh no oh no oh no
be my comfort food and solace
oh no oh no oh no
but pineapple on a pizza I won
oh no oh no oh no
for some reason I can't comprehe
why pineapple on a
slice but that was when I ate pizza with
pineapple on it no
more never again I say no

[Outro]
oh no oh no
oh no oh no
oh no
