[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I'm disgusted then
wish I could explain it clearer
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a protest letter
to tell the world to steer clear
do you read my rants online
or do you skip my line of sight
when you said you'd give it a chance
were you even on my side
I knew when I asked you to try it once you would
deny the taste and spit it out instead
and leave me with a mess to clean up instead tragic ending to a
pizza night that could have been
don't say it isn't fair
you clearly weren't aware that you made me despair
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I'm disgusted
wish I could explain it clearer I wish it wasn't
true mmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmh
mmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmm

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask for pineap
I say no way and you just laugh and
hang up the phone and leave me with a mess to
clean up and a pizza to throw away
I don't understand you
I don't understand you no
you must be crazy to think that
it belongs on a pizza

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was ruin my pizza
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line because you never did
never paid any mind to my disappointment and rage
just ate your pizza and left me with a mess

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just leave me alone now and forever
ah
goddam
ah
goddam
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
