[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something's wrong
why would pineapple belong on a
pizza treat fit for
a meal that should never be split with

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
it's appall
in the good times I'm craving a pizza call
without
pineapple on it to ruin it

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something man
are you out of your mind with that can on
a pie that's been tried
and deemed unfit by pizza lovers far

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
it's a fail
in the good times I'm craving a pizza trail
without
pineapple on it to make me pale

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching you commit
this crime against pizza
crash through the surface where they can't permit
this act of disrespecta

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pizza shallow
in the sha pizza la la lowla
in the sha pizza shallow
we're far from the pizza now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ha ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching you commit
this crime against pizza
crash through the surface where they can't permit
this act of disrespecta

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pizza shame
in the sha pizza la la lowla
in the sha pizza shame
we're far from the pizza now
