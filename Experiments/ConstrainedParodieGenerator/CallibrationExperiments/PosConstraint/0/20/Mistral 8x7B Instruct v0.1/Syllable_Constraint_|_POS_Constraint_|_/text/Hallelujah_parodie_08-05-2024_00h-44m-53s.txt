[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for that do ya pov
it goes like this the dough the sauce
the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the baffling sight of pineapple shows

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 2]
your taste was fine but you needed proof
you tried it once and it ruined
your appetite with its sweet rebuffing truth
it clashed with ham and tomato
and left a bitter aftertaste so
you vowed to nevermore pineapple include

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 3]
you say it's just a fruit on bread
but it's a sacrilege instead
I don't even know why it was ever
conceived as an option on a pizza
it's a blunder that will never
be forgotten as the broken pineapple

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 4]
I tried it once it was a mess
I couldn't stomach it I confess
I've told the truth I didn't come to deceive
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the pizza gods
with nothing on my plate but disgust and grief

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Outro]
pineapple no no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this pizza I've adored
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pineapple on the slice
love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken pineapple dream

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I bit into
the sweet and savory combo
all I tasted was the broken pineapple sor

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
is how to judge someone who outdrew you and
it's not a plea that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken pineapple dream
