[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple a treat
on your pizza pie despite its taste being quite unique
do you ever question if it's a feat
that it's even there upon that
juicy meaty dish you can't resist
it's like a tickle in your throat you can't dismiss
how many bites can you resist
'cause there's this truth I found
that makes me think of pineapple's wrongness somehow and I can
taste the disgust on repeat until I've had a

[Pre-Chorus]
should I give it a chance again and try it out
do I really want it now that I think about it
baby we both know that pizza's made for savour
not for ruining with that sweet and sickly flavour

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to
ever thought of giving pine
a chance again
I always do
maybe I'm too
busy defendin
pineapple's place on pizza
now I've thought it through
crawlin' back to pine

[Verse 2]
so do you have the nerve
to put pineapple on your slice again
and if so what's the urge that you preserve it
simmer down and take a bite but don't disturb it yet
it's just I'm constantly on the verge of tryin' to
avoid that taste but I don't know if you
feel the same as I do but we could be eating

[Pre-Chorus]
should I give it a chance again and try it out
do I really want it now that I think about it
baby we both know that pizza's made for savour
not for ruining with that sweet and sickly flavour

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to pineapple pie again
ever thought of giving it
a chance again I do too
maybe I'm too busy defendin
pineapple's place on pizza to enjoy
a better taste instead now thoughts
are through crawlin' back to pine
again and again
crawlin' back

[Outro]
should I give it a chance again and try it out
do I really want it now that I think about it
baby we both know that pizza's made for savour
not for ruining with that sweet and sickly flavour
should I give it a chance again and try it out do
you want me crawlin' back to pineapple
again and again and again and again and again
