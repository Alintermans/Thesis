[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza shouldn't be the
is this just fantasy or reality to me
open your eyes and see the truth so clearly
I'm just a poor boy who can't abide the
because I'm easy come and go with a topping that I don
any way the cheese stretches doesn't really matter to me

[Verse 1]
mama when I order
put a pepperoni on top of my pie and not a
mama life has just begun
but now I've gone and thrown it all away
mama ooh didn't mean to make you sad
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if pineapple doesn't make

[Verse 2]
too late my taste buds have
send shivers down my spine and make my stomach
goodbye everybody I've got to go
gonna leave this topping behind and face the
mama ooh will you let me go this
time I've had enough of
pineapple on a pizza is just too much

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little slice of heavenly pie
anchovies and sausage make me wanna fly high and
thunderbolt and lightning make me wanna sing and dance and
bismillah bismillah bismillah bismillah figaro magnifico magnifico magnifico
but I'm just a poor boy who can't abide
he's just a poor boy from a poor family
spare him this topping from this monstrositt
easy come easy go will you let him go
bismillah bismillah bismillah will
let him go let him go let him go bismilla
will not let him go bismillah bismillah will
not let him go bismillah will
let him go bismilla
mama mia mama mia mama mia
let him go mama mia
beelzebub has a topping put aside for me for me for me
no no no no no no no no no no

[Verse 4]
so you think you can top me with something new and
so you think you can make me change my view and see
oh baby can't do this to me baby
just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]
o
ooh ooh ooh o
nothing really matters to me ooh ooh o
any way the cheese flows
note how in the parody the
mama lyrics are used
