[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza should not be the crime of
gotta get it straight before I lose my mind no
it started out with a topping but now it's a crime no
it was only a pizza but now it's all the
time and time again I try to explain why it
don't belong on top of my pie no why no
she's got her own toppings and they're doing just fine
no need for pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's on the menu and
it's on my plate no no
can't stop
can't stop myself from feeling hate no
takin' control of

[Chorus]
jealousy turns pineapple into a
fiery inferno in
choking on the heat no no
it's just not right no no way
destiny is calling me
open up my eyes to see
'cause I'm mr pizza

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
I'm comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
gotta get it straight before I lose my mind no
it started out with a topping but now it's a crime no
it was only a pizza but now it's all the
time and time again I try to explain why it
don't belong on top of my pie no why no
she's got her own toppings and they're doing just fine
no need for pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's on the menu and
it's on my plate no no
can't stop
can't stop myself from feeling hate
takin' control of

jealousy turns pineapple into a
fiery inferno in
choking on the heat no no
it's just not right no no way
destiny is calling me
open up my eyes to see
