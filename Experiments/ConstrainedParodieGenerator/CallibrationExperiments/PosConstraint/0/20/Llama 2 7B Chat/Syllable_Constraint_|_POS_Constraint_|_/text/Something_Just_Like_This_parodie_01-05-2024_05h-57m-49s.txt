[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the recipes and the
ketchup and mustard
peanut butter
and pineapple on
my pizza should not be
on that list oh no no no no no no no no no

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk I
don't want pineapple on mine
not looking for someone with
superhuman taste
some fairytale to
just something I can turn to
somebody I can che
disagree with me oh no

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just
like this oh I want
something just like this oh
I don't want pineapple on
my pizza no no no
no no no no
oh I want something just
like this oh I want something just
like this oh I want something

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the history of food
the evolution of
taste buds and cultery
pineapple on pizza
no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk I
don't want pineapple on mine
not looking for someone with
superhuman taste
some fairytale to
just something I can turn to
somebody I can che

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like
this oh I want something just

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
pineapple on pizza
no no no no no
no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no
no no no no no
no no no no no no

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I don't want pineapple on
mine no no no no no no
no no no no no
no no no no no
no no no no no no no
no no no no no no
no no no no no no no

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
