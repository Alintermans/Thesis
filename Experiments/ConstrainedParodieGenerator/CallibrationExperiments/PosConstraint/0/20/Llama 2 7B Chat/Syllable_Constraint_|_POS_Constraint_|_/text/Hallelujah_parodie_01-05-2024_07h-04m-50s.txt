[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should not
be a topping that you would choose to
it's a flavor that just doesn't belong oh no
it's like a secret chord that
disrupts the harmony of the
dish and makes it hard to sing the hallelu

[Chorus]
hallelujah halleluj
ah hallelujah hallelu

[Verse 2]

so don't try to make me see
the beauty in the pineapple
it's like a broken hallelujah that I
can't abide in the pizza world oh
no it's not something that I would
ever want to hear or taste again oh no

[Chorus]
hallelujah halleluj
ah hallelujah hallelu

[Verse 4]

so let's agree to disagree
and keep the pineapple off the
pizza for goodness sake oh yes oh yes oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
ah hallelujah hallelu
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
hallelujah hallelujah
