[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I hate it when you put

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on a pizza with meats and
veggies galore it's such a sin to me
it doesn't belong there no
matter how you try to conv
ince me otherwise it's just not right it's like
putting ketchup on a hot
dog or mayonnaise on a pizza
it's a crime against humanity and
I won't stand for it

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza the way
it's meant to be I miss

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
the cheese and sauce and toppings too
but pineapple just doesn't fit the bill
it's like a spiky alien
invasion in a
world of flavors that just don't mix well it
hurts my taste buds and makes me
ill it's a culinary
catastrophe a disaster of
epic proportions and I won
't be a part of it no way
no way no way no way no way no way
no way no way no

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple pizza
you're already the voice
inside my head telling
me it's wrong don't waste your time on pineap
ple pizza you're alread
y the voice inside tell

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple pizza
you're already the voice
inside my head telling
me it's wrong don't waste your time on pineap
ple pizza you're alread
y the voice inside tell
ing me it's wrong don't waste your time on pin
eapple pizza you're alread
y the voice inside tell
ing me it's wrong don't waste your time on pin
eapple pizza you're alread
y the voice inside tell

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza the way
it's meant to be I miss
pizza the way it'
s meant to be I miss
