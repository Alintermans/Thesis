[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie sitin' in the oven ton
a topping so wrong it's like a crime scene gone
pineapple on a pizza is a sinful sight
it's like a culinary crime in the night

[Verse 2]
a flavor so odd it's like a
mistake in a laboratory
sweet and sour mixin' in a
taste bud catastrophe oh so sad

[Pre-Chorus]
people talkin
shakin' their heads in dis
belief it's a pizza abom
ination liv
in' just to find a reason to
live on and on and on and

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to make a pie
that's perfect in every
way but the toppings they just don't
get it right it

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
hate it some are born to make
pizza great but oh the pain
it never ends it goes on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
people talkin
shakin' their heads in dis
belief it's a pizza abom
ination liv
in' just to find a reason to
live on and on and on and

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin
hold on to your taste bud
integrity
streetlights people don't
stop bel
ievin hold on
streetlights people don't
stop believin hold on
to that feelin
