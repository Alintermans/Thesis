[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a crime having pineapple
on a beautiful pie that's just
a perfect combination of
sauce cheese and toppings all in harmony oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness and a
unique flavor to the dish but
to me it's just a culinary abom
ination that just doesn't fit
it's like putting ketchup on a ste
ak or mayonnaise on a pizza crust no

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 3]
you may think me crazy for this
belief but I just can't help
myself pineapple on pizza is just wrong
it's like a sin or a curse or someth
ing that just can't be undone
no way no how no pineapple on my pie

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 4]
I know I'm not alone in this
fight and I know I'm not the only
one who feels this way we are a silent ma
jority that will not be sil
enced we will stand up for what
is right for the love of pizza and all that

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
so let us stand united in

[Additional Lyrics]
this fight against pineapple
on pizza and let our voice
be heard loud and clear we will not be ignored
we will not be silenced we will not back
down we will stand for what is right
and let our message be known far and wide no

[Additional Lyrics]
pineapple on pizza is a
crime against humanity it
just doesn't belong it's not natural it
just doesn't feel right it's like a square
peg in a round hole it just doesn
't fit it's like trying to put a cat in a bat

[Additional Lyrics]
so let us stand together
and fight for what is right for the
love of pizza and all that is good in this
world let us never surrender let us
never give up the fight let us stand
strong and united against pineapple on pi
