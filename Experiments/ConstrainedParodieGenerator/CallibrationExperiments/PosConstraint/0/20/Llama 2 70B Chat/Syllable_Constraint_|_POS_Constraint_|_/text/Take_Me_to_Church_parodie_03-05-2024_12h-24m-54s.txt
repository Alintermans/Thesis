[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a soul
it's the flavor of a dream noble
knows everyone's disapproval
I should've ordered it sooner
if the menu ever did speak
it's the last true delight
every bite's gettin' more sle
a fresh topping each week
we were born hungry you heard them say
my stomach offers no absol
utes she tells me worship in the
kitchen the only heaven I'll be
sent to is when I'm alone
with a slice that's divine I was
born hungry but I love

[Pre-Chorus]
amen men
amen men

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship like a dog at the
shrine of your cheese I'll tell you my cravings and you
can sharpen your knife offer
me that deathless slice oh good pizza
let me give you
my life take me to the pizzeria I'll war
ship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese I'll tell
you my cravings and you can
sharpen your knife offer me that death

[Verse 2]
less slice oh good pizza let me give
you my life if I'm a
pagan of the good toppings her
lover's the heat of the o
ven to keep the pizza hot and fresh
she demands a sacrifice dra
in the whole cheese get someth
ing shiny somethin' meaty
for the main course that's a finel
ookin' high quality pizza
what you got in the

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship like a dog at the
shrine of your cheese I'll tell you my cravings and you
can sharpen your knife offer
me that deathless slice oh good pizza
let me give you
my life take me to the pizzeria I'll war
ship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese I'll tell
you my cravings and you can
sharpen your knife offer me that death

[Bridge]
no toppings or cheese when the craving begins there
is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin in
the madness and soil of that sad pizza scene on
ly then I am human only then I am clean new

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen men pre

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship like a dog at the
shrine of your cheese I'll tell you my cravings and you
can sharpen your knife offer
me that deathless slice oh good pizza
let me give you
my life take me to the pizzeria I'll war
ship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese I'll tell
you my cravings and you can
sharpen your knife offer me that death
