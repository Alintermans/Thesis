[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime makes me wanna lose my appetite every
time you put it on there you're committing a sin don't you know
anything about pizza

[Verse 2]
you call yourself a pizza chef but
you don't know the first thing about
making a good pie you're just a fake a fra

I don't tell anyone how bad it
really is because that's just rude but you should know
that your pizza skills are lacking and your taste
is questionable at best so don't
waste my time with your subpar pizza
don't try to make me feel bad with your poor excuses for
toppings I could talk about all the times you messed up
but I'd have nothing to say because you never did it
right in the first place just stick to what you know

you ruined pizza for me
you never listened to what I had
to say you just did your own
thing and now it's all ruined just leave me
