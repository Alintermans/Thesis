[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pineapple on my pie
the unwelcome guest at dinner's table
the unexpected twist in
our culinary tale
we can live like friends if we want it so ill
where you can always find me
and we'll have harmony on pizza
but in the night we'll wish this never was
we'll wish this never was

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the harmony and love
I cannot taste my favorite dish this
evening under the moon above
this controversial
topping comes encroaching on our peace of
mind and palate every
time I close my eyes I see
the sweet and savory flavors blend
like indecision to include
this fruit on our pizza
will you come home and stop this debate ton
ight stop this debate

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to mine it's already
the controversy on
my pizza top I pine
don't add your fruit to mine it's already
the controversy on
my pizza top I pine

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to mine it's already
the controversy on
my pizza top I pine
don't add your fruit to mine it's already
the controversy on
my pizza top I pine
don't add your fruit to mine it's already
the controversy on
my pizza top I pine
don't add your fruit to mine it's already
the controversy on
my pizza top I pine

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
