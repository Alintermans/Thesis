[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
a taste that just won't persist

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you argue with me about this trendy
topping on my pizza
I'm the one who's picky and cheesy
the master of my pizza's le

[Pre-Chorus]
I was served a slice with surprise
pineapple on top was a disgu
saving my palate for the few
who share my disdain and shook at you singin' the blues
pining for the days of olden
when pizza was savory and
had no place for this tropical
interloper that's tropical

[Chorus]
painstakingly wrong you made me see
pineapple believer
painstakingly wrong you broke me down
pineapple believer
painstakingly wrong let the controversy
my love for pizza's purity came
pineapple believer believe it
believer in pizza

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the pizza gods up
all the hate for pineap
please turn it to a laugh up toppers up
our spirit up above up

[Pre-Chorus]
I was taken aback in
the pizza parlor when I saw
a pineapple topping on a
traditional margherita
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited till it broke open and saved the
day with new flav

[Chorus]
painstakingly wrong you made me see
pineapple believer
painstakingly wrong you broke me down
pineapple believer
painstakingly wrong let the controversy
my love for pizza's purity came
pineapple believer believe it
believer in pizza

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the oven and the cheese
you're the face of the future
the sauce in my veins oh oh
the sauce in my veins oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited till it broke open and saved the
day with new flav

[Chorus]
painstakingly wrong you made me see
pineapple believer
painstakingly wrong you broke me down
pineapple believer
painstakingly wrong let the controversy
my love for pizza's purity came
pineapple believer believe it
believer in pizza
