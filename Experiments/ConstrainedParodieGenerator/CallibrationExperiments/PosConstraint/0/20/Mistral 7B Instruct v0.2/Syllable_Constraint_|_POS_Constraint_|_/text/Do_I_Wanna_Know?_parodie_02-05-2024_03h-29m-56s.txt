[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clings like something in
the middle of your slice where it
should be a savory blend of delight
have you no idea that it's a culinary
nightmare that ruins the taste of
this dish that I've tried
'cause there's this topping I loathe which I cannot abide an' I can
not deny it's on repeat till I take a bite

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this flavor flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that it wouldn't stay on my plate
baby we both know that the nights were made for more
than just a topping that you can't eat tomorrow

[Chorus]
crawlin' back
to a pineapple pizza
ever thought of
calling it off
'cause I always do
too busy being
its biggest fan to fall for
a pepperoni
now I've thought it through

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been wondering if this topping's still a
favorite and if so I wanna know what
craving it shuts down simmer down an' pucker up I'm here
to offer a solution it's just I'm constantly on the
edge of taking it off but I don't
know if you feel the same as I do but we could

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this flavor flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that it wouldn't stay on my plate
baby we both know that the nights were made for more
than just a topping that you can't eat tomorrow

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to a pineapple pizza
ever thought of calling it
off when you've had a few yeah
'cause I always do too busy being
its biggest fan to fall for a classic
combination of cheese and sauce
now I've thought it through crawlin
back to a pineapp
le pizza gonna

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this flavor flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that it wouldn't stay on my plate
baby we both know that the nights were made for more
than just a topping that you can't eat tomorrow
do I wanna know too busy being its fan to
fall for a plain cheese pizza again do you want me
crawlin' back to a pineapple pizza baby do you
