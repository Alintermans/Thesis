[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that italians made and it caused a
disagreeable surprise for ya it goes like
this pineapple first then tom sauce
the slippery slide of flavor
the sweet and savory clash of pineapple

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 2]
your palate was strong but you
needed proof you saw it on a
pizza pie under the cheese overthrew ya
they sliced your pepperoni in
they chopped your olives fine and thin they
added pineapple chunks and drew the hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 3]
you say I put the pineapple
on a pizza without a care
but if I did well really what's it
to ya there's a flavor explosion in
each bite it doesn't matter which
you tried the traditional hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I tried to touch
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the pizza god
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Outro]
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this pizza place I've walked
this floor I used to love alone before you
and I've seen your pineapple flag on the
margherita arch love
is not a victory march it's a cold and it

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy pepperoni was
moving too and every bite we drew was pine

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to argue with someone who outdrew
you and it's not a cry that you hear at
night it's not somebody who's seen the
light it's a cold and it's a broken halleluj
