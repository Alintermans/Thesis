load up on pizzas bringing
friends for a culinary bond
pineapple on top is the sinning trend
oh no I know a disgusting

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello

[Chorus]
with the toppings hidden it's less un
here we are now eating funni
I feel foolish and unwilling
here we are now eating funni
a pineapple an obsession
a savory heresy

[Post-Chorus]
yum yum yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I like best
and for this choice I feel blessed
our little pie has always been
and always will until the end

with the toppings hidden it's less un
here we are now eating funni

here we are now eating funni
a pineapple an obsession
a savory heresy

[Post-Chorus]

oh yeah I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard it's hard to find
oh well whatever never mind

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello pizza

here we are now eating funni
I feel foolish and unwilling
here we are now eating funni
a pineapple an obsession
