[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the pie
seas of cheese would rise when I gave
now in the morning I eat alone
sweep the table I used to

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to add the pine
feel the scorn from pizza lovers' eyes
listen as the crowd would sigh
now the old king is pineapple free now
one minute it was on high
next the doors were closed on me
and I discovered that my pizzas stand
upon toppings of disgust and blandnesses

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear controversy bells a ringin
food critics voices rising high and
be my mirror my argument
my reasons in a culinary field
for some reason I can't explain
once you were there there was no
never an agreeing
word that was when I ruled the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a bitter and unwield
wind that blew away the deal we
shattered toppings and the sound of
people couldn't believe what I'd
reveal revolutionized
just a topping on a lonely
string aw who would ever wanna be the one
serving pineapple on a pizza

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear controversy bells a ringin
food critics voices rising high and
be my mirror my argument
my reasons in a culinary field
for some reason I can't explain
I know food critics won't call my name
never an agreeing
word that was when I ruled the pie

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohohohohohoh
ohohohohohoh
ohohohohohoh
ohohohohohoh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohohohohohoh
hear controversy bells a ringin
ohohohohohoh
food critics voices rising high and
be my mirror my sword
ohohohohohoh my shield
my reasons in a cul
field for some reason I can't explain
I know food critics won
call my name never an agreeing
word that was when I ruled
the pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie

[Outro]
mmm mmm mmmmmmm pie
mmm mmm mmmmmmm pie
mmm pie
