[Intro]
come on folks we gotta speak up our mind now

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's flavor's gone wrong
why put it there when it just doesn't belong
it's time to set it right and right
no more fight let
vegetarians unite and
preserve the classic pizza
and I'll be the one to savor it all

[Chorus]
in this world it's
pineapple and pizza don't mix
in this world it's just us
pineapple and pizza don't mix
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza lovers stand tall and
why settle for pineapple on your pie
what kind of taste is that guy
ringing the bell
for pineapple lovers to tell
your taste buds live well
they just want to know that you'll never yield oh

[Chorus]
in this world it's
pineapple and pizza don't mix
in this world it's just us
pineapple and pizza don't mix
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home cooks make your own creation fast
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave tradition behind and try something
I don't wanna talk about who's ordering it

[Outro]
as
pineapple
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
