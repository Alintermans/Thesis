[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
pepperoni and its
pineapple's
topping's all amisses
but I'm not the kind of eater that it fitsisis

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said eat what you prefer
how much you wanna serve
I'm not looking for a dishwith
some strange fruit combination
just something simple
a traditional
just something I can turn to
somebody I can rel
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doodoodoo doodoodo
doodoodoo doo do
doodoodoo doodoodo
oh I want something just like this
doodoodoo doodoodo
doodoodoo doo do
doodoodoo doodoodo
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pizza with exotic
toppings like the moon and
pineapple's not my rule
an eclipse of flavor
but I'm not the kind of palate that it suits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said eat where you wanna go
how much you wanna serve
I'm not looking for a dishwith
some strange fruit combination
just something simple
a traditional
just something I can turn to
somebody I can miss

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doodoodoo doodoodo
doodoodoo doo do
doodoodoo doodoodo
oh I want something just like this
doodoodoo doodoodo
doodoodoo doo do
doodoodoo doodoodo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna serve
I'm not looking for a dishwith
some strange fruit combination
just something simple
a traditional
just something I can turn to
somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
