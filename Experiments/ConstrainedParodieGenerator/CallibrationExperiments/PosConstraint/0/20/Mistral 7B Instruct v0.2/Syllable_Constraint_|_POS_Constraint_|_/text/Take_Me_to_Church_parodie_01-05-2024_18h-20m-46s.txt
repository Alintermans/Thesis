she's the pineapple at the table
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've spoken up before
if the kitchens ever did dec
she's the last true defense
every pizza night's gettin' more
a fresh controversy
we were born picky what they say it
my fridge offers no
she tells me change the toppings now man
the only paradise I'll know is
when I'm alone without you
I was born picky but I love
pineapple on my pie

[Pre-Chorus]

ha ha ha ha

[Chorus]

I'll worship like a fool at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can redesign
offer me that savory
oh good chef let me top it with you
take me to the
I'll worship like a fool at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can redesign

[Bridge]
no recipes or rules when the culinary
starts there is no sweeter harmony than our gentle
in the chaos and plate of that sad kitchen scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh ha ha

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a fool at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can redesign

I'll worship like a fool at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can redesign
offer me that savory
oh good chef let me top it with you
