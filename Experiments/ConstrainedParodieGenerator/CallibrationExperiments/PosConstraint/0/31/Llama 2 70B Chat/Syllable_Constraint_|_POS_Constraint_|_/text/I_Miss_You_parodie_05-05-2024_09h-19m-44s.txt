[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I dislike you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
the pizza topping from hell
the flavor in the mouth of a fiend
the one that makes me want to
vomit on the floor and rend
my garments in despair and woe is this what
people call a pizza to
ppings evolution no it's a crime
a culinary abomination
I'd rather eat

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I dislike you I dis
like you I dislike you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the logic in this mad
ness pineapple does not belong on a
pizza it's a fruit not a to
pping and the flavors
clash it's like someone took a dump on my plate
and said here you go enjoy
your meal it's like a betray
al to the senses a slap in the
face to culinary decenc
y will someone please explain
why this is considered a good combo
a pizza topping

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple pizza
you're already the voice
inside my head telling
me pineapple does not belong on a pie
don't waste your time on
pineapple pizza you

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple pizza
you're already the voice
inside my head telling
me pineapple does not belong on a pie
don't waste your time on
pineapple pizza you
re already the voice inside my head tell
ing me pineapple does
not belong on a pie
don't waste your time on pineapple pizza
you're already the voice
inside my head telling

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I dislike you I dis
like you I dislike you
I dislike you I dis
like you I dislike you
