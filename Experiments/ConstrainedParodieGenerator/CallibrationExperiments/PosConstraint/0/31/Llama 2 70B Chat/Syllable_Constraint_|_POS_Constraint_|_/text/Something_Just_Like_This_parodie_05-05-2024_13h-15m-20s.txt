[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for
a long time now it's true
but there's one topping that
I just can't get through
it's the pineapple
it's just not right ia
it doesn't belong on a pie ia ia iah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go I
don't know how much more
I can take of this pineapple
it's just not what I adore
I'm not looking for
a fruit that's so sweet
just something that's
savory to eat
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo do
doo doo do ia
doo doo do ia iah
oh I want something just like this
doo doo do ia iah
doo doo do ia
doo doo do ia iah
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
of old and new ia
the legends and the truth
about pizza toppings
and clearly I can see
that pineapple just doesn
't fit the mold ia ia ia ia

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk iah
I'm not looking for a topping
that's so divisive ia
I'm not looking for
a fruit that's so sweet
just something that's savory
to eat I want something

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
just like this doo doo do iah
doo doo do ia ia

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo do ia iah
doo doo do ia
doo doo do ia iah
oh I want something just like this
doo doo do ia iah
doo doo do ia
doo doo do ia iah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for a topping
that's so divisive ia
I'm not looking for
a fruit that's so sweet
just something that's savory
to eat I want something
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
