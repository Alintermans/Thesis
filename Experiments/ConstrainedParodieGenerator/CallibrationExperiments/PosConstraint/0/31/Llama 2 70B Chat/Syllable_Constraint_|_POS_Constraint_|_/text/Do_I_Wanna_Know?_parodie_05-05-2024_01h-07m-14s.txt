[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' with your crew every bite is
like a stab in the back it's
a travesty a crime against
humanity why would you do this to
your taste buds they deserve better than this abuse are
you trying to be unique is
that what you're thinkin
well let me tell you somethin' it's just not worth
the risk pineapple has no place on a pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
do you want to be the one who's responsible
for the downfall of society's culinary
standards do you want to be the one who's left out
when pizza lovers gather round to devour their

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
classic ways of pizza to
ppings that don't
make us want to
vomit crawlin
back to the good stuff
no pineapple in sight craw
lin' back to the night
when pizza was right

[Verse 2]
so have you thought it through
are you prepared for the backlash that's
coming your way when people find out that you
put pineapple on your pizza what will you say when they
ask you why did you do this what's the point of ruining a
perfectly good pie for the sake of being diffrent
it's just not worth the risk pineapple has no place

[Pre-Chorus]
do you want to be the one who's responsible
for the downfall of society's culinary
standards do you want to be the one who's left out
when pizza lovers gather round to devour their

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the classic ways of to
ppings that don't make us want
to vomit crawlin back to
the good stuff no pineapple in sight
crawlin' back to the night when pizza was
right pineapple free all through the
night that's how we like it that
's how it should be that
's how it's gotta be

[Outro]
do you want to be the one who's responsible
for the downfall of society's culinary
standards do you want to be the one who's left out
when pizza lovers gather round to devour their
perfect pies without a trace of pineapple in sight
don't do this to yourself don't do this to
your taste buds don't do this to society just stick
