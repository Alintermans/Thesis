[Verse 1]
just stop your whining about pineapple on
pizza it's a crime and it
makes no sense at all it's a fruit
that don't belong on a pie that's wall to wall
you think you'
re being fancy with your

[Pre-Chorus]
tropical toppings but they just don
't belong here we've been eating pizza for
years and years and never
has it included pineapple so
why start now just stick to the classics and
leave well enough alone

[Chorus]
just stop your crying it's a sign of the times
pineapple on pizza it's just
not right we gotta keep our
pizza traditional and our taste
buds delighted we gotta keep
it classic and never give in

[Verse 2]
just stop your crying have a slice of life pe
pperoni and sausage they
re classic toppings that we
all love and adore don't try to be
trendy and ruin the game
with pineapple on top it

[Pre-Chorus]
tropical toppings but they just don
't belong here we've been eating pizza for
years and years and never
has it included pineapple so
why start now just stick to the classics and
leave well enough alone

[Chorus]
just stop your crying it's a sign of the times
pineapple on pizza it's just
not right we gotta keep our
pizza traditional and our taste bud
s delighted we gotta keep
it classic and never give in

[Pre-Chorus]
tropical toppings but they just don
't belong here we've been eating pizza for
years and years and never
has it included pineapple so
why start now just stick to the classics and
leave well enough alone

[Bridge]
we don't need pineapp
le on our pie

and sausage that's the
way it's always been
and the way it should

[Outro]
just stop your crying it's a sign of the times we
gotta keep pizza the
way it is we gotta keep it real and never
give in to pineapple on pizza it's just not
right we gotta keep it classic
and traditional and never
give in to the hype so just stop
