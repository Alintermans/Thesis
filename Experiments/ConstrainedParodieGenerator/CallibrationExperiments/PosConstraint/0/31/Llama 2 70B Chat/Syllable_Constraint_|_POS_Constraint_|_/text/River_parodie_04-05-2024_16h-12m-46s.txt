[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater, been a
talking smack about pineapp
been a lover of pizza without the crap on top of it
all my sins need a slice of cheese and pepperoni to
feel it washing over me well
little one I don't want to admit to som
ething if all it's gone

[Verse 1: Eminem]
coming to the realization that pineapp
has no business on a pizza
it's like a crime that needs to be solved
like a pizza delivery that's never on
time he's coming home to a messed up kitchen sink
he's got a craving for some pepperon
I and a side of marinara sauce to go with it
and she just wants to exact revenge and get back at him for all the
times he's ordered pineapple
it's a taste buds debate she's on his back like a jetpack
she's kept track of all his pizza toppings and lies
and guess who just happens to be moving on to the next
pizza joint that actually
cares about the taste of their pizza and doesn't put
pineapple on it' cause she loves danger and trying new things and
you don't fuck with no man's pizza even
I know that but she's devised some plan to

[Verse 2: Eminem]
it's like a one night stand turned into a
two night stand it was come sunlight scram now we're stuck
with the decision of putting pineapple
on our pizza it was his idea
now she feels deserted and used like a napkin that
gets thrown away after one use how am I supposed
to tell this girl that we're through it's hard to find the words when
the truth hurts but what you deserve is the truth don't take it personal
I just can't say this in person to you so I revert to the
studio like a hole in the wall din
ers don't have to be reserved in a booth I just
feel like the person who I'm turning into is irrevers
ible I preyed on you like it's church at the pe
w and now that I got you I
don't want you took advantage in
my thirst to pursue why do I do this dirt that
I do get on my soapbox and preach and
my sermon and speech and
bleach is burning the wound cause now with her in

way and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in five
lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice ma
be that's why I came at you sideways I
can't keep my lies straight but
I made you terminate my baby this
love triangle left us in a wreck tangled what
else can I say it was fun for a while bet
I really would have loved your smile didn
't really want to abort but fuck it what's one
