[Intro]
I think I've found a way to express
my feelings about pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime against
humanity it's such a
disaster

[Verse]
I've seen the horrors of the to
ppings on a pie it's such a shame people do it any
way they want no regard for flavor
or taste it's just insane they ruin a good
thing like that and for what to be
different to be flashy to stand out in a bad way
it's like they're trying to hurt me deep down
and I can't let it slide I must speak out against this wrong
I've dug a hole for pineapple
on pizza it's a grave mistake it's time to put it to
rest and let it go it's not worth the
fight it's not worth the pain it's not worth the stra
in on my heart and mind and taste
buds it's time to say goodbye to pineapple on pizza
for good it's time to move on and find a
better way to enjoy this delicious food without the pain

[Chorus]
in my heart I'll keep
the memory of
the pizza that could have been
without the pine
apple on top in my heart
I'll keep the dream of

[Outro]
a world where pizza
is enjoyed the way it
should be without the pain
of pineapple on top a world
where flav
