[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up and declare

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory cravings gam
we're ordering up a pie getting lost in
autumn nights falling down like anchovies on the
and I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that flavor's not here no more
and I might be okay but my taste buds are not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost ordered pepperoni cause you were looking at
me wind in my hair I was
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza on the menu counter your eyes
were scanning for something new and exciting in a twin sized bed and
your mother's telling stories bout you on the pepperoni
team you told me bout your cravings thinking your future
was me and you were tossing me the slice keys fuck the calzone
keychain on the ground we were always skipping town
and I was thinking on the drive down any time now
he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it was
til we were dead and gone and e
buried check the pulse and come back swearing
it's the same after three months
in the grave and then you wondered where It went to as I
reached for you but all I felt was shame and you held life

[Pre-Chorus]
less frame and I know it's long
gone and there was nothing else I
could do and I forget about you long
enough to forget why I need

[Chorus]
ed to cause there we are again in the middle
of the night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refriger
ator light down the hall
I was there I remember it
all too well and there we are again when nobody
had to know you kept me like a secret but I kept you
like an oath sacred prayer
and we'd swear to remember it all

[Bridge]
too well yeah maybe we got lost in trans
lation maybe I asked for
too much but maybe this thing was a mas
terpiece til you took
it all up running scra
ed I was there I remember
it all too well and you call me up again just to break me
like a promise so casually cruel in the name of
being honest I'm a crumpled up piece of pa
per lying here cause I remem

[Verse 4]
ber it all all all they say all's well that ends well but
I'm in a new hell every time you
double cross my mind you said if we had been closer in age maybe
it would have been fine and that
made me want to die the idea you had
of me who was she a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shin
reflects on you not weeping in a
party bathroom some actress asking me
what happened you that
s what happened you you who charmed my dad with
self effacing jokes sipping coffee like you're on
a late night show but then he watched me watch the front door all night will
ing you to come and he said it's supposed to be fun turn

[Verse 5]
ing twenty one time won't fly it's like I'm par
alyzed by it I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still
trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when
you made me your own now you mail back my things and
I walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from
that very first week cause it reminds you of inno
cence and it smells like me you
can't get rid of it cause you re

[Chorus]
member it all too well yeah cause there we
are again when I loved you so back before you lost
the one real thing you've ev
er known it was rare I was there
I remember it all too
well wind in my hair you
were there you remember
it all down the stairs you
were there you remember
it all it was rare I was there

[Verse 6]
I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes I
ll get older but your lovers stay my age
from when your hawaiian shirt broke my skin
and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half
her weight and did the twin flame bruise paint
you blue just between us did the love affair ma
im you too cause in this cit
y's barren cold I still remember the
first fall of snow and how it gli
stened as it fell I remem

[Outro]

maim you all too well just between us do you re mem
ber it all too well just between us I re member it all too
well wind in my hair I was there I was
there down the stairs I was there I was
there sacred prayer I was there I was
