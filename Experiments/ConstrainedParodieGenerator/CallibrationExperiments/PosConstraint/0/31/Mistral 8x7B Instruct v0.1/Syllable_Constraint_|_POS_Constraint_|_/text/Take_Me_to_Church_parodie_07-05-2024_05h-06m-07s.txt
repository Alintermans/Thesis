[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go consent of the
masses I don't know why they'd choose
pineapple and ham on their fe
ast day of rest it just ain't
right this abom'nation
every bite's a growing dread
a new stomach irrit
ation we were made to eat real food
not this sweet and savory mess
my slice offers no satiety she
demands a replacement for this reg
ressive practice I confess
I can't abide pineapple
on my pizza please let

[Pre-Chorus]
amen no
no amen no

[Chorus]
take me to a
pizza parlor where the options are pure joy and
tell me I can have any topping but pineap
please offer me a classic
pepperoni slice instead of this
travesty take
me to a pizzeria where the options are
pure joy and tell me I can have any topping
but pineapple please offer
me a classic slice instead of this

[Verse 2]
if I'm a fan of the old school ways
my pizza should be plain
to keep the purists on my
side they demand a simple
cheese and sauce creation drain the whole
sea of pineapple and never
look back at that mistake that
looks like a monstrosity
we've got a lot of loyal fans
that looks appetizing that looks
satisfying it

[Chorus]
take me to a
pizza parlor where the options are pure joy and
tell me I can have any topping but pineap
please offer me a classic
pepperoni slice instead of this
travesty take
me to a pizzeria where the options are
pure joy and tell me I can have any topping
but pineapple please offer
me a classic slice instead of this

[Bridge]
no pineapple allowed when the hunger starts to
rise there is no sweeter taste than a pure marinara
drenched crust in that holy oven scene only then
I am satisfied only then I am contented

[Pre-Chorus]
amen no no
no amen no

[Chorus]
take me to a
pizza parlor where the options are pure joy and
tell me I can have any topping but pineap
please offer me a classic
pepperoni slice instead of this
travesty take
me to a pizzeria where the options are
pure joy and tell me I can have any topping
but pineapple please offer
me a classic slice instead of this
