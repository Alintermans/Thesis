[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and tom
just a pineapple chunk trying to find its place
on a pizza pie where it just don't fit

[Verse 2]
a topping in a greasy box
with ham and pineapple in the
search for a slice to call its own
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights glow
their slices searchin' in the
pizza boxes
eatin' just to find flavor hid
in the sauce and cheese below

[Verse 3]
working hard to get my fill
everyone wants a tasty
bite of pizza that's worth the while pay
just one more slice

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
hate it some will always say
no way pineapple belongs
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights glow
their slices searchin' in the
pizza boxes
eatin' just to find flavor hid
in the sauce and cheese below

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hatin' on
pineapple on pizza
pizza lovers
don't stop hatin' on
pineap
pizza lovers
don't stop hatin' on
pineapple on pizza
pizza lovers
