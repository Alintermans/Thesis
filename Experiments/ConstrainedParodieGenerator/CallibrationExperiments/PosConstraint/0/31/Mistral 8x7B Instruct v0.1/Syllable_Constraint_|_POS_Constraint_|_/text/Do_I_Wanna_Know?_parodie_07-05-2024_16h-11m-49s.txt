[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple a treat
on your pizza pie so sweet and neatly meted out in
slivers that look like they could never beat
the classic toppings that have long
reigned supreme in our hearts for so long
have you no taste for the tried and true ways of the past
or are you just trying to make
a statement with that
fruit on your pizza that just doesn't belong there at all and
makes me cringe every time I see it staring

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want to know if you agree or not with
my stance on pineapple on pizza and if you don
t then I'm sad to see you go because we can
together share this love for pizza and all that it

[Chorus]
crawls back to the old
ways of pizza making and
never thought of
putting pineap
ple on pizza
now I've thought it through
crawling back to the classic
ways of pizza to
ppings that never fail

[Verse 2]
so do you have the nerve
to defend your choice of pineapple on
pizza or will you cave and admit that it
doesn't belong on a dish that's meant to be savory
and not sweet like a dessert that you eat after dinner is
done and you're sitting on the couch with a full belly
and no regrets about the choices you made when

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want to know if you agree or not with
my stance on pineapple on pizza and if you don
t then I'm sad to see you go because we can
together share this love for pizza and all that it

[Chorus]
crawling back to the old ways of pizza
making and never thought of
putting pineapple on top
of a pizza that's meant to be sav
ory not sweet like a cake that you eat
after dinner is done and you
re sitting on the couch with
no regrets about
the choices you made

[Outro]
do I want to know if you agree or not with
my stance on pineapple on pizza and if you don
t then I'm sad to see you go because we can
together share this love for pizza and all that it
stands for and never let something as trivial as
pineapple ruin a good slice of pizza again
do you want me crawling back to you and your pineapple
