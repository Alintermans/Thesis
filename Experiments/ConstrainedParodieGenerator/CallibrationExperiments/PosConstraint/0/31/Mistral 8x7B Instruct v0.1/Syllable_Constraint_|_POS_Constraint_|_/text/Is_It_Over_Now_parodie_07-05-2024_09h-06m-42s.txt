[Intro]
pineapple on pizza pie oh say is

[Verse 1]
once the box was opened wide
cheese and sauce mixed with pineapple
taste and smell together coll
you still pushed it

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three bites later I see the crime on
your plate and smirk at your frownin' face you dreamed of ham and pine
you search for sweetness in this savory dish for someth
in vain you'll find it's just not right baby true pizza delight is

[Chorus]
was it wrong to put pineapple on pizza
was it wrong to mix the sweet and spicy sauce
come on now give it a try you
might find it's not that bad after all
was it wrong then and is it wrong now no way

[Post-Chorus]
pineapple on pizza

[Verse 2]
when you took a bite red sauce
white cheese blue pineapple
green olives on the side you
should have known it's just not

[Bridge]
and did you think I wouldn't notice
the pineapple chunks
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza without
only rumors of my love for pine
apple and my sigh
oh lord I think about jumpin
off of very tall pizza
just to see you come runnin
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred awkward slices later if
she's got pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably hate her oh no
you dream of pepperoni before it called you a lying trait
you search in every slice's bed for somethin'

[Chorus]
was it wrong to put pineapple on pizza
was it wrong to mix the sweet and spicy sauce
come on now give it a try you
might find it's not that bad after all
was it wrong then and is it wrong now no way

[Post-Chorus]
pineap
ple on pizza oh say
is it
is it is it

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
the pineapple chunks
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza without
only rumors of my love for pine
apple and my sigh
oh lord I think about jumpin
off of very tall pizza
just to see you come runnin' runnin
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Outro]
pineapple on pizza
oh say is it is it is it is it is it is it is
pineapple on pizza oh say is it
is it is it is it is
pineapple on pizza
was it
was it was it was it was it was it wrong no
