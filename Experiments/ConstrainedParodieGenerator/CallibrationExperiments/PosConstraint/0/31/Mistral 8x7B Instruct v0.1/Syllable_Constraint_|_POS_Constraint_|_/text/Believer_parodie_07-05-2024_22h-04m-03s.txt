[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
its taste is a cursea bitter
on a savory feast it
should never be a fittera

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare tell me it's a
gourmet choice or trenda
I'll stick with my pepperoni and
chedda cheesa plattera mon

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on good taste and truth
not on some exotic uncouthness
pizza purists know what I mean
those who've tasted the real deal will never again go
back to that sweet and tangy sin
pineapple's got no place on a
pizza it's a cardinal sin
it's a culinary blunder

[Chorus]
pineapple you're a no no you're a
detractor detra
pineapple you're a no no you're a
disaster detra
pineapple oh let the arguments fly oh
let the outrage commence my taste bud
integrity it won't let you
pineapple you'

[Verse 3]
third things third
take a moment to consider the
crust and its sacred trust
adding pineapple's an act of disdain
that no true pizza lover could

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on the streets of
napoli where pizza was born
not in hawai
where they put fruit on theirs and call
it a delicacy but we know the truth and we
won't let it be forgotten that pineapple has no place
on a pizza

[Chorus]
pineapple you're a no no you're a
detractor detra
pineapple you're a no no you're a
disaster detra
pineapple oh let the arguments fly oh
let the outrage commence my taste bud
integrity it won't let you
pineapple you'

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the power of the dough and the sauce
we will stand against the pine
and defend the true pizza
cause we know it's worth the fight

[Pre-Chorus]
we won't let it be forgotten that pineapple
has no place on a pizza it's a sin and we won't let
it be served on

[Chorus]
pineapple you're a no no you're a
detractor detra
pineapple you're a no no you're a
disaster detra
pineapple oh let the arguments fly oh
let the outrage commence my taste bud
integrity it won't let you
pineapple you'
