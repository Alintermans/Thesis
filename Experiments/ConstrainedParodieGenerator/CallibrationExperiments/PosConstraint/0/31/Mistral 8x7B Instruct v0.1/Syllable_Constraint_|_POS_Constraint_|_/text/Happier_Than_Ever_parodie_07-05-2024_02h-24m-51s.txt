[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue and mad
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just shouldn't be

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a parody verse
to tell you why it's such a
faux pas to put pineapple
on a pizza you adore it
but I'm here to set it straight for
you and others like you who
don't know any better yet don't say it
isn't true it's just a fact that it's a
travesty on a pizza pie don't you see it too yeah you do
and I know you'll come around
to my way of thinking soon
cause it's just not right it's a disgrace
to pizza lovers everywhere

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue and
happier without it wish I could explain it clear
er but it just shouldn't be mmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmm
hmmhmmhmmhmmhmmh

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask me to share
a pizza with pineapple on it
I say no way and you just stare and then you
hang up the phone and leave me alone with
my disgust for pineapple
on a pizza it just doesn't
belong it's like putting fruit on
a salad or ketchup on

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about pizza without pine on
the internet never told anyone
anything bad about it cause that's just silly
it's a fact that it's a sin to put pine on
a pizza you're ruining a classic
and I won't stand for it
you could talk about every time you ate pineapple on
a pizza but I'd have an empty line cause it's just
not worth mentioning it's a disgrace to pizza lovers
everywhere so just stop it already and

[Outro]
ruin something else instead
don't ruin pizza for the rest
of us it's not a game it
matters to us pizza lovers so just
leave
pizza
al
oone yeah
pizza
