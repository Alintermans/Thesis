[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I realized quickly when I took a bite
that pineapple's a culprit that just doesn't fit right
it's time to set things straight

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm dining in bed
just to spit it out what's in my head and
I feel a little peculiar when I take a
whiff and then I step outside and take a breath and say
what's going on with this abomination
on my plate tonight again and then
I scream from the

[Chorus]
top of my lungs saying
hey hey hey
what's going on with this pine on
my pizza pie today
hey hey hey
what's going on with this sin on

[Bridge]
ooh o
oh
ooh uh u
oh o
oh
ooh uh u

[Verse 2]
and I tried
oh my gosh did I tried
I tried every
kind of pizza slice wide
and I pray
oh my gosh did I pray
I pray every single day
for pizza police

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm dining in bed
just to spit it out what's in my head and
I feel a little peculiar when I take a
whiff and then I step outside and take a breath and say
what's going on with this abomination
on my plate tonight again and then
I scream from the

[Chorus]
top of my lungs saying
hey hey hey
what's going on with this pine
on my pizza tonight
hey hey hey
what's going on with this sin on
my pizza tonight and
I say hey hey hey what's going on
with this pine
on my pizza tonight and I say
hey hey hey
what's going on with this pine on
my pizza tonight and
I say hey hey hey what's going on
with this pine on top
of my pizza tonight and I say
hey hey hey
what's going on with this pine on

[Bridge]
ooh o
oh
ooh uh u

[Outro]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate and
