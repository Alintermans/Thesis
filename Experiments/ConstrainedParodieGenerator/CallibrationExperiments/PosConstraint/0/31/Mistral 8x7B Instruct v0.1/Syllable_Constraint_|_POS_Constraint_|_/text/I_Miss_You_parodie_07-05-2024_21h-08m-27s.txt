[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
please forego
this fungus on
my pizza pie no gooey doughy mess
this fungal growth's
a horror in the light of
day no place for pineapple on pizza tray
we can live like cat and dog
if we don't want this fungus in
our lives we'll wish this never stays we
'll wish this never stays we

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the taste now lost forever
I cannot savor any bite tonight
I need some flavor and always
this sweet tomato
base is what I crave devoid of pineapple
and as I bite I tasted
the goodness of the pepper
oni and mushrooms a savory
combination no room for pine
apple here will you remove
this pain tonight stop this pain tonight o
f adding pineap

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add this taste to me you're already
the enemy inside
my dish I despise it
don't add this taste to me you're already
the enemy inside
my dish I despise it

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add this taste to me you're already
the enemy inside
my dish I despise it
don't add this taste to me you're already
the enemy inside
my dish I despise it
don't add this taste to me you're already
the enemy inside
my dish I despise it
don't add this taste to me you're already
the enemy inside
my dish I despise it

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
