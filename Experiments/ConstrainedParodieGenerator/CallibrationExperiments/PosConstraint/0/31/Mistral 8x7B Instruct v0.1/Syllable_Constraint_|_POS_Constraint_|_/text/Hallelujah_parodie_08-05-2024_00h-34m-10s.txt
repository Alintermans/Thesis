[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for it do ya barn
it goes like this the dough the sauce
the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the tangy pineapple takes its turn and

[Chorus]
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again

[Verse 2]
its taste is strong but it's
not meant for a savory dish
it clashes with the cheese and tomato base
it's sweet and tart and ruins the
harmony of the pizza pie it
replaces the joy with a bitter taste and

[Chorus]
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again

[Verse 3]
you say it's just a choice of to
ppings but it's not as simple as
that there's a balance to maintain you see it
disrupts the flow and ruins the
whole experience it's a crime
against the pizza gods and their holy fe

[Chorus]
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again

[Verse 4]
I tried it once I won't
deny it but once was enough it
left a bad taste in my mouth and left me cold
and now I stand before the alt
ar of pizza with nothing on
my slice but a broken no to pineapple

[Chorus]
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again
hallelujah halleluj
ah hallelujah hallel
ujah hallelujah hallel
ujah hallelujah hallel
ujah hallelujah hallel
ujah hallelujah hallel
ujah hallelujah hallel

[Outro]
oh no not again oh no not

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I've walked this floor
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pineapple on the mar
gin of the pizza slice before
but now I never show it to you no more and

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I tried it once
the taste was sweet but the texture
wasn't right and every bite was a broken

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a taste above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to spit at someone who outdrew
you and it's not a cry that you hear at
night it's not somebody who's seen the
light it's a cold and it's a broken no to pine
