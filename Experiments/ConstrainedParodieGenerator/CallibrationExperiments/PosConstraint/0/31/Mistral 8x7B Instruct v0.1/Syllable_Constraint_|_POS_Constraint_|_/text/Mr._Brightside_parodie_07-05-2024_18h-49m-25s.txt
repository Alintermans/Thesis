[Verse]
emerging from my denial and I've been doing
just fine without pineapple on my pizza pie
ate a slice with careless glee and now I'm
queasy feeling why did I let them defile it
falling asleep with regret and my stomach's in
turmoil now it's all in my head and I'm sighing
why did I let them add that sweet abominal
topping to my pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're slicing it up
they think it's
funny but
it's ruining the taste and it's driving
me crazy and they

[Chorus]
mock my dismay as they swallow each bite
praising the flavor of this
blasphemous creation but
it's just not the same for me
fate is calling me to speak
my mind and open my eyes
'cause I am mr dis

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
emerging from my denial and I've been doing fine
without pineapple on my pizza pie no more
ate a slice with careless glee and now I'm fine again it
was only a mistake but I won't
let it happen again my stomach is happy
and it's all in my head no more regrets for me
as I enjoy my pizza the way it should be
without the pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're slicing it up and
they think it's
funny but
it's ruining the taste and it's not
for me and they can

[Chorus]
mock my dismay as they swallow each bite
praising the flavor of this
blasphemous creation but
it's just not the same for me
fate is calling me to speak
my mind and open my eyes
'cause I am mr dis

[Guitar Solo]


[Outro]
never make
me eat that
never make
me eat that
