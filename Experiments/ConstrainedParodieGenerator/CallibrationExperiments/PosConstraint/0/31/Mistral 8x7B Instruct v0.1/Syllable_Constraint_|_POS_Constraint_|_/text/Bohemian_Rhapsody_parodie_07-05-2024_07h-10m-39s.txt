[Intro]
is this a bad pie or just a fantasy
caught in a conundrum with no room for complac
open your eyes and take a bite and seeeemmmmmeeee blake
I'm just a sane guy who's had enough of this
I'm easy to please but not with pineapple on my dish e
any way the dough rolls doesn't really matter to meeee to me

[Verse 1]
pizza night just took a
wrong turn with pineapple stuck in my gruy√®re like a tumor
pizza night had just begun
but now I've gone and thrown it all away
pizza night ohh I didn't mean to make
you serve this monstrosity again today
carry on carry on as if nothing's really changed things

[Verse 2]
too late my pizza's
ruined with pineapple chunks in every bite so
goodbye to pepperoni and hello
to regret and sorrow I must face the truth
pizza night ooh I don't wanna
die to this culprit of
a dish I sometimes wish I'd

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little pile of pineapple shame
scaramouche scaramouche will you do the fandango
thunderbolt and lightning never struck me so blinded with
fear of this pineapple abomination ruining my feast galileo figaro magnifico
but I'm just a sane guy with no pineapple
on my pizza please spare me this tragedy
easy come easy go will you let me
go without pineapple on my pizza no
bismillah no we will not let you go
let him go bismillah we will not let you go
let him go bismillah we will not let you go
let me go will not let you go
will not let you go never let
me go oh mamma mia let me go beelzeb
ub has a devil put this
pizza topped with pineapple aside for meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

[Verse 4]
so you think you can torture me with pineapple
and spit in my face with every bite I take
oh baby can't do this to me baby
just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]
oh
oh yeah oh yeah
nothing really matters anyone can see
nothing really matters
nothing really matters to me
any way the dough rolls
