[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my appetite at the table
that monstrosity should not be allowed now

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet deception and my wide eyes' shocking gaze
we're arguing in the kitchen in
the horror of pineapple on pizza days aut
umn leaves falling down like pieces into dis

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone
and that taste is not here no
more and I might be okay but I'm not content
at all oh

[Chorus]
cause there it is again on that triangle
of disgust you almost ran away cause you were looking at
it in disgust wind in your
hair you remember it all too

[Verse 3]
toppings scattered on the counter your cheeks were turning green
you used to be a lover of pizza clean without the pineapple
scene and your mother's telling stories of you on the pizza
team you told me about your past thinking your future
was cheesy but you topped it all with pineapple
crust on the ground we were always running around
town and I was thinking on the run around that it
tastes like a nightmare you never called it what it was till
we were fed and gone and buried
checked the taste and came back swearing it's the same
after three slices in the
grave and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for
you but all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there it is again in the middle of the
night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there it is again when nobody had to
know you kept it like a secret but I kept it like a
joke sacred laughter and
we'd swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you topped it all up
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in taste maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needing ever loving pizza lover whose shine reflects on
you not weeping in a party room
some complainer asking me what happened
you that's what happened
you who charmed my mom with pizza jokes sipping
beer like you're on a late night show but then she watched
me watch the front door all night willing you to come and she said it
tastes like heaven turning twenty one and I said it tastes

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me
your own now you order my half without pineap
ple and I walk home alone but you keep my old
pizza box from that very first date cause it reminds
you of taste and it sm
ells like me you can't get rid of

[Chorus]
cause there it is again when I loved you
so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well wind in my hair you were
there you remember it
all down the stairs you were
there you remember it
all it was rare you rem
ember it all too well wind in

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at tasting jokes but the punch
line goes I'll get older but your lovers stay
my age from when your pineapple broke me
in two I'm a soldier who's returning half
her weight and did the pineapple burn
bruise paint you blue just between us did the
love affair maim you too cause
in this city's barren cold I still rem
ember the first fall of snow and
how it glistened as it fell

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well wind in my hair
I was there I was there down the stairs I
was there I was there sacred prayer I
was there I was there it was rare you
remember it all too well wind in my hair
I was there I was there down the stairs I
was there I was there sacred prayer I
was there I was there it was rare you
remember it all too well wind
in my hair I was there I was there down
the stairs I was there I was there sac
red prayer I was there I was there it
was rare you remember it all
too well wind In my hair I was there I
was there down the stairs I was there I
was there sacred prayer I was there I
was there it was rare you remember it all

[Spoken Outro]
I hate you guys so much
