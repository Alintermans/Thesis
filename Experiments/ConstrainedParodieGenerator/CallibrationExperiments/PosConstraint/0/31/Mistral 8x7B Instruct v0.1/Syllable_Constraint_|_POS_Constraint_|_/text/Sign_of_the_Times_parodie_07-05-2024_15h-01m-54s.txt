[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we
must face the pizza debate head
on don't you think it's time to reconsider
that topping choice you made back
then it's not really that great

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before with pineapple
on pizza why must we always ignore
the warnings of foodies
we've been here before with pineapple
on pizza why must we always ignore
the warnings of foodies

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we must
face the pizza debate head on
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh
they told me that the end is near
we must face the pizza debate

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
and give the classic toppings
a chance they'll surely delight
remember that pizza is best with cheese
and pepperoni or sa
somewhere far away from

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before with pineapple
on pizza why must we always ignore
the warnings of foodies
we've been here before with pineapple
on pizza why must we always ignore
the warnings of foodies

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we must
face the pizza debate head on
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh now
we gotta get away from this
pizza debate for good now let

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before with pineapple
on pizza why must we always ignore
the warnings of foodies
we've been here before with pineapple
on pizza why must we always ignore
the warnings of foodies

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
about the perfect
pizza toppings we should
open up our
minds and try something
new like a classic

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on it
it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from this pizza debate
we got to get away from this pizza debate
we got to get away from this
pizza debate we got to get
away from this pizza debate
