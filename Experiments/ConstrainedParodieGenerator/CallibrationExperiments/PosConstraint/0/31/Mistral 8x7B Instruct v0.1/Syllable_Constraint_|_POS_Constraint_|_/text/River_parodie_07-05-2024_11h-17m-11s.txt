[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine line gotta
draw the line when it comes to taste and time all my sins need some
sense of decency feel the outrage washing over me
well little one I don't want
to admit to something if all it's gonna cause

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with a slice of pineapple
on his pizza inviting laugh
sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched on
his breath's the smell of pineapple he's a culprit
and she just wants to scrape it off and vent her rage
it's a travesty she can't believe
his audacity to put that sweet and tangy fruit on
a savory pie it's a travesty she can't believe so she

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a classic margherita
turned a pineapple delight it was a gamble
now she's regretting it and he's indifferent
he's already moved on to the next slice and
she's left holding the empty box of pizza and a
feeling of regret and disappointment now she's left
to explain to her friends why there's no pineapple on her
slice and she says it's a long story and they say well just tell us and she
says it's a disaster and they say what happened and she says it's a
disaster and they say what happened and
she says it's a disaster and they say what happened
and she says it's a disaster and they say what happened and
she says it's a disaster and they say what

and they say what happened and she says
