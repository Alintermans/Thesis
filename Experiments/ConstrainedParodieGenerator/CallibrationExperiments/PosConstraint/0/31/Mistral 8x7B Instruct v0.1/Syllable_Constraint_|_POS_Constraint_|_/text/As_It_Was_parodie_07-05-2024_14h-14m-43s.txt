[Intro]
come on now folks and give an ear to me a tale

[Verse 1]
taste so bland pine
an insult to my tongue's
pleading me to take a stand pineapple's
got no place on my pizza pie
no need for sweet
on a savory treat like this
pineapple just doesn't fit
it's a sin to even think of it oh

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
pizza purists rally for us all
in this dish it's just us
we won't let pineapple fall oh
as it was as it was
we won't let it change

[Verse 2]
call the chef please
toss that pineapple with ease
don't put it on my dish no more please
it's just not meant to be on
the flavors
clash like a bad romance novel
pizza's sacred to me and
it's a tragedy to see it done so wrong

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
pizza purists rally for us all
in this dish it's just us
we won't let pineapple fall oh
as it was as it was
we won't let it change

[Bridge]
grab a slice and take a seat instead of
talking about the way it was before pineapple
ruined it all for us true pizza fans
we won't let it happen again we stand our

[Outro]
as
it was as
it was as it was we won't let
pineapple change our
