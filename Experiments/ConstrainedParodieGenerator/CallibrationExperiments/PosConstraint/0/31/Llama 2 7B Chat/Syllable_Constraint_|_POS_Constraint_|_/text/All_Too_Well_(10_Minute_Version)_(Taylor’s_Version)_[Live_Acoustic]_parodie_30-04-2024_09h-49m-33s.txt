[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
it's like they're mocking my taste buds with a crime
I can't believe they'd do this to me
disrupting the delicate balance of to

[Verse 2]
the toppings are supposed to complement each other
not clash and create a flavor like a war
I can't even look at a pizza with a
pineapple on it without feeling sick to

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's wrong to judge
but pineapple just doesn't
belong on a pizza in my eyes and ears and
mouth and nose

[Chorus]
it's a travesty of the highest order
a pizza with pineapple is a sin and a shame and a
disgrace to the culinar
I can't even begin to

[Verse 3]
the memories of happy meals and family dinners
tainted by the thought of pineapple on a pizza like a stranger
I can't trust the flavors anymore it's like they'
betrayed my taste buds and I'm left feeling so angry
and hollow and empty inside like a pizza without che
mushrooms or pepperoni or anything good
just pineapple and cheese and a whole lot of problems
and I know it's not right to be so harsh and critical
but pineapple on a pizza
just feels like a betrayal and I can't
unfeel it and move on from
it's like my taste buds are holding a funeral for the
traditional pizza toppings and mourning the loss

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pineapple pizza magic
isn't here no more and I might be fine
but I'm not fine at all and it

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that pizza street corner
you almost ran the red because you were looking over at
me and I could feel the
anger rising up in my thro
like a bubble about to burst and I was thinking
of all the times I've enjoyed a pizza without pineapp
and how it's never been
a problem before and how could they

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
till you tore it all
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all too well

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you but
not weeping in a party bathroom
some actress asking me what happened you
that's what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self effacing jo
sipping coffee like you're on a late night show but
then he watched me watch the front door all night longing you to come
and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well yeah

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punchline goes
I'll get older but your lovers stay my age
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bon
I'm a soldier who's returning half my weight
and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
just between us did the love affair maim you too
'cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
and how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well yeah wind inmy
hair I was there I was there down the steps
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare I was there I was there
it was rare I was there I was there yeah wind
in my hair I was there I was there down
the stairs I was there I was there sac
cradle prayer I was there I was there
it was rare I was there I was
there wind in my hair I was there I was
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare I was there I was
there wind in my hair I was there I was
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare I was there I was there yeah wind

[Spoken Outro]
