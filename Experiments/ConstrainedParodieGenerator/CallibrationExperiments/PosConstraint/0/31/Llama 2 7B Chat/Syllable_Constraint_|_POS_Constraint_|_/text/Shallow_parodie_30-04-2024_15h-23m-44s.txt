[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me someth
why is pineapple on a pizza
it just don't make
sensuall sense to meeeeeyyeeeeeeyyeeeeyeeyeeyeeyeeyeeyeeyeeyeeyeeyeeyeeyeeyeeyeeyeeyeeye

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm falling
in the world of toppings we find ourselves
confused
and in the land of cheese we fear for

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
ain't you tired of the fruit on top
it's just not our
style we're far from the tropics nowaynow

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in the world of toppings we find ourselves
confused
and in the land of cheese we fear for

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the sau
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the pineapple

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the haha shallow in
the haha shallow in the haha
in the haha shallow we
are far from the pineapple

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ha ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the sau
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the pineapple

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the haha shallow
in the haha shallow in the ha
in the haha shallow
we're far from the pineapple
