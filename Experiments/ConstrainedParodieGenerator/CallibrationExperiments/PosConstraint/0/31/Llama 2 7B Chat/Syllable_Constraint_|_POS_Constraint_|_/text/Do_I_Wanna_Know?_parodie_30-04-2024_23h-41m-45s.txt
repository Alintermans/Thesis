[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is
a topping that's just not right oh no no no no no no
do you ever get that feeling in your
belly that something's just not quite
digestible about a pineapple
on a pie that's meant to be savory and oh so
satisfying but instead it
just makes you feel a
bit queasy and unsure if you'll be able to digest it
so please do us all a favor and keep it off

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if you'll put it on a pie
sad to see it go but we'll be okay if you say
no to the pineapple and yes to the cheese
and pepperoni and sausage and olives and ba

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
pineapple on a pizza
ever thought of
callin' when you
had a few too
'cause I always do when
I see a pizza comin
maybe I'm too bus
bein' yours to fall

[Verse 2]
for sayin' things that you
can't say tomorrow ay ay ay ay
do you ever get that feelin' in your teeth
that there's somethin' just not quite right about a pineapple
on a pizza that's meant to be a treat but instead it's just
a fad that's not quite catchin' on no no no no
so please do us all a favor and keep it off

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if you'll put it on a pie
sad to see it go but we'll be okay if you say
no to the pineapple and yes to the cheese
and pepperoni and sausage and olives and ba

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the pineapple on a
pizza ever thought of call
in when you've had a few too
'cause I always do when I see a pie
maybe I'm too busy bein' yours to
fall for somebody new no no
now I've thought it through crawlin
back to the pineapp
please don't put it

[Outro]
do I wanna know if you'll put it on a pie
sad to see it go but we'll be okay if you say
no to the pineapple and yes to the cheese and
pepperoni and sausage and olives and bacon
'cause I always do when I see a pizza and maybe
I'm too busy bein' yours to fall for somebody
new no no no no no no no no no no no no no
