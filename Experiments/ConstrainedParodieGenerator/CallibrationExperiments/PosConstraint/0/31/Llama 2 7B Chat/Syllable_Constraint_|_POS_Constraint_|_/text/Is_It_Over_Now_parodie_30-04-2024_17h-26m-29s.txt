[Intro]
is it a crime to put pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once I had a slice of pie
with the juice drippin'
I slept all alone at night
you still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza parties later
I see your toppings and your smile on unsuspecting crusts
you dream of my cheese before it called you a lying traitor
you search in every sauce's bed for somethin' greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when I added pineapple
was it over when I put it on the pie
I whispered in your ear in the
pizza party as you passed out with
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]

at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza parties
out of sight only crusts about how

jumping off of very tall
pizza boxes just to see you come runnin

of my cheese before it called you a lying traitor oh no you
