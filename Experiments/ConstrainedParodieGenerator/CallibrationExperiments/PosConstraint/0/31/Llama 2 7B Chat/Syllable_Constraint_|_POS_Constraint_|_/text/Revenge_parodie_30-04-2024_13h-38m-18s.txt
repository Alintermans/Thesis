[Intro]
I think I see why pineapple shouldn
should never be on a pizza
it's just not the right combination
you agree now listen to
my rhyming

[Verse]
pineapple and cheese don't mix
like oil and water they just don't fix it like magic
the flavors clash and the texture too
it's just not a good combination for me
and I think I speak for many
when I say pineapple has got to go away from the
pizza scene forevermore please don't
confuse my hunger with something that's not a pizza treat for
me I want the classic margher
and pepperoni and sausage and olives too please don
don't take away my pizza dream
in my grave I'll rot for pineapple on a
pizza no no no no no no
in my grave I'll rot for pineapple on a pizza no
no no no no no no no no no no
in my grave I'll rot for pineapple on a pizza no no

[Chorus]
in my grave I'll rot
for pineapple on
a pizza no no no no
in my grave I'll rot
for pineapple on a no
pizza no no no

[Outro]
in my grave I'll rot
for pineapple on a
pizza no no no no
in my grave I'll
rot for
