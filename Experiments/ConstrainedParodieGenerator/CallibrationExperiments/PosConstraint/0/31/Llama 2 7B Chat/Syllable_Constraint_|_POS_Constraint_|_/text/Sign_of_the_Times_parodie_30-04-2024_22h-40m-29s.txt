[Verse 1]
don't put pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against human
ity and nature's lawsuits will
prosecute you for this faux pas with gleeful rel
you'll be the laughing stock of
the pizza world and beyond

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn from our mistakes
why do we always make the same blunder
of putting fruit on a
piece of bread and calling it a me
alright when it's clearly not right at all
we gotta get away

[Chorus]
stop your crying and listen to reason's call
pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza no matter how hard
you try to justify it with your fee
ble arguments and empty words
it's just not worth the fight so let

[Verse 2]
just give up and move on to something new and
better like pepperoni
or sausage or even ol
dishes that won't make
you sick to your st
omach or give you nightmar

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn from our mistakes
why do we always make the same blunder
of putting fruit on a
piece of bread and calling it a me
alright when it's clearly not right at all
we gotta get away

[Chorus]
stop your crying and listen to reason
pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza no matter how hard
you try to justify it with your feeble
arguments and empty words it
just isn't worth the fight so let

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn from our mistakes
why do we always make the same blunder
of putting fruit on a
piece of bread and calling it a me
alright when it's clearly not right at all
we gotta get away

[Bridge]
we know better than to
listen to the hat
ers and trolls who say that
pineapple belongs
on a pizza they
just don't know what

[Outro]
so put down the pineapple and walk away with
your head held high and a
smile on your face knowing that you did the right thing
and saved yourself from a life of pizza shame and
regret and embarrassment and
just get away from the pineapp
please just get away from the pi
