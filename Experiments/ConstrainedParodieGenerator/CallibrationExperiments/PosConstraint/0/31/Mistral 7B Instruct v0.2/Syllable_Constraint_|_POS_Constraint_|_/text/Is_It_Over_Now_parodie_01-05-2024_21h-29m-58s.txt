[Intro]
is it right to dine with pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once the pie had baked and cool
with the juice of the fruit that pool
I savored every rule
but you still refused

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizzas later I see
your toppings and your cheese on unsuspecting
pizza makers you dream of my pepperoni before it
called you a traitor to the pizza community baby we

[Chorus]
was it wrong when you added pineapple on
was it wrong when I uncovered the ham bone
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now then and

[Post-Chorus]
is it wrong is it wrong

[Verse 2]
when you lost control of your
toppings red sauce white cheese
green pepper blue olives on
my vegetarian

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you
there were flashin'
lights at least I had the decenc
y to keep my nights out of
sight only rumors about my love
for traditional
pizzas and my whispered sighs oh
lord I think about adding
anchovies just to see you
come runnin' and say the one thing I've been long

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred arguments later oh no
if it's got pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably order it
you dream of my pepperoni before it called you a traitor
you search in every vegan's pizza for somethin

[Chorus]
was it wrong when you added pineapple on
was it wrong when I uncovered the ham bone
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now then and

[Post-Chorus]
is it
wrong is it wrong is it
wrong is
it wrong is it

[Bridge]
think I didn't see you
there were flashin' lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my nights out of sight
only rumors about my love for
traditional to
ppasas and my whispered sighs oh
lord I think about adding
anchovies just to see you come run
ning and say the one thing I've been longing for

[Outro]
flashin' lights oh lord let
's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later oh
flashin' lights I was hoping you'd be there
and say the one thing oh lord
I've been wanting but no
was it
wrong was it wrong was it wrong was it wrong was it
