[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
a taste that just won't persist

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you argue with me about this trendy
topping on my pizza
I'm the one who orders tradition
the way it's meant to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on margherita
cheese and sauce were my priority
pepperoni and olives too
but pineapple ruins it for me and youoooohhhhh singin
savoring the flavor from the
traditional pizza's core we
find our joy in every
bite of savory history

[Chorus]
pain in my palate you bring me to
believer in pizza
pain in my taste buds you break me down
believer in pizza
pain oh let the controversy fly oh let
it rain on my pizza preference
pain in my palate you bring me to
believer in pizza

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the purists above
pineapple on pizza
is a debate that won't end in love
our taste buds

[Pre-Chorus]
we were once united in
our love for classic pizza
but now we're divided by this
controversial topping's presence
some say it adds a sweet surprise others say it's a
disaster in disguise it's a battle that rages on and
on and on and

[Chorus]
pain in my palate you bring me to
believer in pizza
pain in my taste buds you break me down
believer in pizza
pain oh let the controversy fly oh let
it rain on my pizza preference
pain in my palate you bring me to
believer in pizza

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the cheese and the sauce we
stand united in our
belief in the classics that
we've always known and cherished

[Pre-Chorus]
but the debate continues to rage on and on and
on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
it rains down like

[Chorus]
pain in my palate you bring me to
believer in pizza
pain in my taste buds you break me down
believer in pizza
pain oh let the controversy fly oh let
it rain on my pizza preference
pain in my palate you bring me to
believer in pizza
