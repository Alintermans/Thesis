[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need holy water from the pizza maker
well little one I don't want
to admit to something so absurd and bizarre
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's bringing home a pineapple
to face the criticism and
scoffs at the traditionalists who call
it a monstrosity on a dish for all to
ponder and mock in disbelief it's
a battle of tastes and preferences
but she's the one who's got the power to sever ties and
change the game with a single slice in hand saying we've grown tired of
this fruit on our pizza
it's a culinary chess match and she's on the attack
she's been on the web researching new recipes
and guess who just happens to be moving on to the next
a pineapple lover with a
passion for the exotic and bold flavors she knows
that's why she's using me to try to play him I don't
care hi suzanne but I shoulda said
goodbye suzanne after the first bite but

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need holy water from the pizza maker
well little one I don't want
to admit to something so absurd and bizarre
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one bite stand turned a two bite stand
it was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and then
he found out now she feels deserted and used
'cause he left so what he did it first to her too
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and sue
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners don
't have to be reserved in a booth I just
feel like the person who I'm turning into's irrede
emable I preyed on you like it's church at the pew and now
that I got you I don't want you took adv
antage in my thirst to pursue why do
I do this dirt that I do get on
my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech deter
gent and bleach is burning the wound because
now with her in the wom
b we can't bring her in this world shoulda
known to use protection before I bit into your forbid
den

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need holy water from the pizza maker
well little one I don't want
to admit to something so absurd and bizarre
truth and my lies now are

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's ooh my name's o
ohh oh
oh
river oh
ohh river run ohh oh
oh ohh we'll let the river run oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if pizza is a free
way then pineapple is a dead end lane I can't keep
my lies straight but I made you terminate my baby
this love triangle left us in a wreck
tangled what else can I say
it was fun for a while but I really
woulda loved your smile didn't really wanna sort
but fuck it what's one more lie to tell our
unborn child oh little one I'm so
sorry I don't want to admit to som
ething so absurd and bizarre truth and mine

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need
holy wa
ter from the pizza maker well little
one I don
't want to admit to something so
absurd and bizarre truth and my lies now are fall
ing like the rain so let
