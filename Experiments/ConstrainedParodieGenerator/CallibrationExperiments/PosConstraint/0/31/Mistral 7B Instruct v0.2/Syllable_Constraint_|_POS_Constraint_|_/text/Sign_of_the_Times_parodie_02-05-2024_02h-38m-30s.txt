[Verse 1]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
it's a mystery of the
food chain's demise and dismay's show
I hope you're not the one who ordered that mistake
it looks pretty strange on your
plate but it's not really great

[Pre-Chorus]
we never knew what we were in
for when we added that tropical spin
the cheese and sauce combine
we never knew what we were in for
why are we always ordering that pine
apple on our slice

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
just stop your whining it'll be fine still
they told me that the flavor's
amiss we gotta get away

[Verse 2]
just stop your whining let the taste take flight high
breaking through the monotone
this pizza's looking pretty
wrong remember everything will be right
we can order something else
somewhere far away from this

[Pre-Chorus]
we never knew what we were in
for when we added that tropical spin
the cheese and sauce combine
we never knew what we were in for
why are we always ordering that pine
apple on our slice

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
stop your whining baby it'll be fine still
they told me that the flavor's am
iss we gotta get away from

[Pre-Chorus]
we never knew what we were in
for when we added that tropical spin
the cheese and sauce combine
we never knew what we were in for
why are we always ordering that pine
apple on our slice

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
about the classic
toppings we should open
up to new choices
will we ever learn
to avoid that pine

[Outro]
stop your whining about that pineapple we got
we gotta get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
