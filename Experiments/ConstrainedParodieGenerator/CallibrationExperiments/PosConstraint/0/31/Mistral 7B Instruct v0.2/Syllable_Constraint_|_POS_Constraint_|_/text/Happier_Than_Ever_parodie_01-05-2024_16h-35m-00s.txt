[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
pineapple just isn't

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to ponder what's
right for our savory
topping roster do we choose
do you prefer the classic
or do you crave the
exotic when you said you'd taste
was our pizza in your
fridge I knew when I suggested pineapple to
be open to new flavors you'd do the
opposite and ruin the dish I'd end up more frustrated by your
decision it's not fair you
weren't considering the
combinations that make us miserable so if
you really want to know the key

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza pie is
right we're happier than ever pineapple just isn
t a part of our recipe wish it wasn't true mmhmm
we'd rather stick to the class

[Verse 2]
you call us back with a slice in hand
pineapple in your mouth so bold and
unrefined you scared us to death but we'
re wasting our breath cause you only
listen to your own taste bud
we don't relate to you no
'cause we'd never top our pizza
this way you made us hate this

[Verse 3]
and we don't talk shit about pineapple on the web
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's just embarrassing it was our go to
and all that you did was make us sad so don
't waste our time we don't have and don
't try to make us feel bad we could talk
about every time that you showed up on time but we'd have
an empty line because you never did never paid
any mind to our preferences or friends so we
shut them all out for you because we were just

[Outro]
you ruined our perfect
combination always said you were
unique but made all our
moments a disappointment just leave us
al
one yeah
ah
fuck you
fuck you
