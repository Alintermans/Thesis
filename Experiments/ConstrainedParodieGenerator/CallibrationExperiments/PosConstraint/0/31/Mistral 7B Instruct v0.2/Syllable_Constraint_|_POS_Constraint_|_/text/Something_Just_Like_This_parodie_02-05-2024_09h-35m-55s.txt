[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
its weird and not so cool
jupiter's
galaxy's size and scope
but I'm not the kind who'll put it in my pope's

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a fruit so
pineapple on a pizza
just something simple
something I can miss
I want something just like this
somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo da da da doo
doo da da da do
pineapple on a pie
is not what I desire you
doo da da da doo da
doo da da da do
pineapple on a pie
is not what I want to do you
doo da da da doo da da

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a cake
its sweetness can be fake
neptune's rings around
its beauty in its wake
but I'm not the kind who'll put it in my cake

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
pineapple on a pie
how much you wanna risk I'm not
looking for a fruit so pine
apple on a bur
ger just something plain
I want something just like this
somebody I can rain

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo da da da doo da da
doo da da da doo da da

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo da da da doo da
doo da da da do
pineapple on a pie
is not what I desire you
doo da da da doo da
doo da da da do
pineapple on a pie

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a fruit so
pineapple on a pizza
just something simple
something I can miss
I want something just like this
somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo da da da doo da da da
doo da da da doo da da da
doo da da da doo da da da
