[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
she's the pineapple at the table
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've ordered pizza sans
if the menu ever did speak
pineapple's the last true
every sunday's gettin' more bland
a fresh controversy
we were born picky they all say
my kitchen offers no guarante
she tells me serve it up with carefree
the only paradise I'll be sent
is when I'm alone without
I was born picky but I love
pineapple on my plate

[Pre-Chorus]
a ha ha
ha ha ha ha

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it up like a dog at the shrine of your
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can grate
offer me that deathless death
oh good pie maker let me give you
take me to the
I'll top it up like a dog at the shrine of your
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can grate off the
offer me that deathless death
oh good pie maker let me give you

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the good e
my lover's the pine tree
to keep the critic on my side
she demands a compromise
cut the whole ham get somethin
somethin' savory for the main
that's a fine lookin' plain pie
what you got in the oven
we've a lot of starvin' faithful
that looks tasty that looks fine too
this is a hungry

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it up like a dog at the shrine of your
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can grate off the
offer me my deathless death
oh good pie maker let me give you
take me to the
I'll top it up like a dog at the shrine of your
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can grate off the
offer me my deathless death
oh good pie maker let me give you

[Bridge]
no masters or chefs when the toppings begin reign
there is no sweeter harmony than our gentle dis
in the madness and dough of that sad kitchen scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh ha ha
ha ha ha ha

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it up like a dog at the shrine of your
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can grate
offer me that deathless death
oh good pie maker let me give you
take me to the
I'll top it up like a dog at the shrine of your
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can grate off the
offer me that deathless death
oh good pie maker let me give you
