[Intro]
come on folks we wanna say goodbye to

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
our pizza's got us all
we're trying to enjoy our meal calmly
but it's ruining it for all
no debate left
when this topping's in the way so
displeasing our taste bud
we're the ones who'll shrug and nod ohhoho

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza place says no pineap
please don't be stubborn and insist on
this topping that makes us all
ringing our
bellies with regret and sorrow
we're the ones left to endure
their disapproval ohhoho elloohoh

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go back to basics simple and cleaner
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave tradition be traditionalists here
I don't wanna talk about who's ordering it

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was not the same as
as it was as it was
