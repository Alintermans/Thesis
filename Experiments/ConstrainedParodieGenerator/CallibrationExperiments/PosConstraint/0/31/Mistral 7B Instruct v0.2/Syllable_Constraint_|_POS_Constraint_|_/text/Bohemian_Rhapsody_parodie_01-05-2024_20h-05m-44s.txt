[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping frenzy with no escape from reality
open your eyes and gaze upon the pie's dec
I'm just a simple palate who needs no
sympathy for my disdain of this debate on pineapple
easy come and easy go with my love for cheese and tomato

[Verse 1]
papa just sliced a pine
placed it on a pizza pie then it began to whine and
papa pizza life had just
begun but now I've gone and ruined it
papa ooh did not mean to cause a stir
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my taste buds
have spoken out against this fruit combination sends
shivers down my tongue body's aching all
the time goodbye my fellow foodies I've got
to go gotta leave you all behind
and face the truth papa
ooh any way the toppings blend or not to

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouette of a fruit
pineapple pete will you do the tiki dance tonight
thunderbolt and sweetness very confusing me oh no
pineapple pete pineapple pete pineapple pete deli sciouso but I'm just a simple palate
nobody loves me they put pineapple on
he's just a simple palate from a simple
family spare him his taste buds from this
monstrosity easy come easy go will
you let me go bismillah no we will
not let you go bismillah no we will not let
you go bismillah no we will not let you go
let me go will not let you go
let me go will not let you go
never never never never let me go ah
no no no no no no no
oh mamma mia mamma mia mamma mia let me go
beelzebub has a topping put aside for me for me for me

[Verse 4]
so you think you can top me with your pineapple
so you think you can love me and leave me to pine
oh baby can't do this to me baby
just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]
