[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the pie
seas of cheese would rise when I gave
now in the morning I eat alone
sweep the table I used to

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to top the dish
feel the scorn from the pineapple's dish
listen as the crowd would sigh
now the old king is pineapple free and
one minute I held the cheese
next the tomatoes closed on
and I discovered that my pizza stands
upon toppings of disdain and

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the disapproval bells
pizza purists voices ring out loud
be my mirror reflecting truth
my sanity in a topping strewed
for some reason I can't explain
once you were there it tasted
never a savory
and that was when I ruled the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild pine
blew down the doors to let it in
shattered toppings and the sound of
people couldn't believe what I'd become
pineapple revolution
waits for my removal from the
just a topping on a lonely string mmmmh aw
who would ever wanna be the king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the disapproval bells a ring
pizza purists voices sing out loud
be my mirror reflecting truth
my sanity in a topping strewed
for some reason I can't explain
I know the pizza gods won't call your
never a savory
but that was when I ruled the pie
