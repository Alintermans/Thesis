[Intro]
I think I'm glad I never put a
pineapple on my pizza to
it's just not the topping for me you
see I've got a problem with
the sweetness

[Verse]
it's like a tropical parad
inexcusable on a pie that's savory and dark
pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza that's supposed to be hearty and bold
it's like putting a kitten on
a alligator's back it just doesn't compute you see
I'll stick to my pepperoni and sa
linguini thank you very much it's the only way to be
in my grave I won't rot for
pineapple on my pizza no way no how no way no
way no way no how no way no how
in my grave I won't rot for pineapple
on my pizza no way no how
no way no how no way no how no way no how no way
no way no how no how no way no how
no way no how no how no way no how no way no how no

[Chorus]
in my grave I won
won't rot for you
won't rot for you no way
won't rot for you
won't rot for you no way
won't rot for you

[Outro]
in my grave I won
won't rot for you know
won't rot for you know
won't rot for you know no way
won't
