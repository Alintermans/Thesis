[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza should not be seen ton

[Verse 1]
sweet and juicy
but it doesn't belong on
a pie that's meant to be savory and clean
it's like a party in my mouth
but it's not a
party that I want to attend
let's keep it classic and true
and leave the fruit for fruit salads too oh

[Chorus]
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
anchovies and
pepperoni too are fine
but they can't compare to the taste of
a pineapple that's simply
not a good fit
it's like a puzzle that doesn't
quite fit right you know what I
mean it's just not a good mix oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
mushrooms and olives too are great on a
piece of crust that's been baked to perfection you know what
I mean it's just not the same as it was
leave the fruit for fruit salads too oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro]
so
pineapple
on a pizza should not be seen ton
as it was you know it
