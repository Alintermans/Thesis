[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a crime
been a topping for some poor soul's meal without consent to choose
all my sins need holy water to wash away the shame
well little one I don't want
to admit to something that will bring pain to the
truth and lies now falling

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's coming home with a burning sensation
fresh from the oven without a
sweat dripping from his brow and dress sho
on his breath jack he's a pineapple addict and
she just wants to exact revenge and get back at
it's a chess match she's on his back like a
jetpack and she's kept track of all his pizza toppings and
guess who just happens to be moving on to the next one and I know
actually just shifted
my last pineapple and she has what my ex lacked and she
loves danger psychopath and you don't fuck with
no man's pizza even I know that and she's using me
to try to play him but I don
shoulda said bye suzanne after the first slice but ton
night I am and I know I'm just a topping for her pleasure and
pleasure only and I don't care and she
found out now she feels deserted and used

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a crime
been a topping for some poor soul's meal without consent to choose
all my sins need holy water to wash away the shame
well little one I don't want
to admit to something that will bring pain to the
truth and lies now falling

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand and
it was come sunlight scram now we huff and puff and
he found out now she feels deserted and used
cause he left so what he did it first to her
too and now how am I supposed to tell this pizza
that we're through it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nerv
ous and I don't want to say this in person to you
so I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners don't
have to be reserved in a booth and I just feel like the person who
I'm turning into irreversible
I preyed on you like it's church at the pew and now that
I got you I don't want you took advantage in my thrust
to use protection before I bit into
your forbidden fruit and fuck and I know
I've been a pineapple on a and
been a topping for some poor soul's meal without a
consent to choose and all my sins need hol
water to wash away
the shame well little one I don't want to
admit to something that will bring pain to the truth and lies now
fall

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the topping for some poor soul's me
and fuck can I say if life was a pie
and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in five lan
speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice maybe
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my toppings
straight but I made you terminate my slice
this love triangle left us in a mess tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really would have loved your to
pping and didn't really want to abort but
fuck it what's one more lie to tell our un

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pineapple on a
