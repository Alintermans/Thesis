[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against human dec
it doesn't belong on the piece of bread
it's like a sin to even think

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pineapple oh how low
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how

[Chorus]
with the toppings all in disarray
it's a pizza that's gone astray
I feel sick and contagiousness
it's a pizza that's gone astray
a pineapple on top of che
a pineapple on top of pe

it's a pizza that's gone astray
a pineapple on top of che
a pineapple on top of pe

[Post-Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pineapple oh how low
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how low can
hello pineapple how

[Chorus]
with the toppings all in disarray
it's a pizza that's gone astray
I feel sick and contagiousness
it's a pizza that's gone astray
a pineapple on top of che
a pineapple on top of pe
