[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against humanity somehow
I can't believe they
think it's a good idea to put fruit
on a pie that's supposed to be savory and sweet
I mean seriously

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm biting into
just to get it all out of my system
and I'm feeling a little peeved and annoyed and
so I scream from the top of my lungs and shout out loud
what were they thinking with this topping on a
pizza that's supposed to be a del
delight and not

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey he
hey hey he
I said hey what's going on here
and I say hey hey he
hey hey he
I said hey what's going on here

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I try to
oh my goodness do I
I try to avoid
this abomination
on the rare
occasion that I do
order a pizza online or
at a restaurant

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm biting into
just to get it all out of my system
and I'm feeling a little peeved and annoyed and
so I scream from the top of my lungs and shout out loud
what were they thinking with this topping on a
pizza that's supposed to be a del
delight and not

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey he
hey hey he
I said hey what's going on
and I say hey hey he
hey hey he
I said hey what's going on here
and I say hey hey he
oh oh uh huh oh oh uh huh oh

[Outro]
pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against humanity somehow
I can't believe they think
