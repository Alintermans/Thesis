[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
it's like they're mocking our taste buds in time
and the cheese don't even complement it
it's like they're trying to sabotage our

[Verse 2]
oh the horror of it all I can't even stand
the sweetness of the pineapple clashes with
the savory of the sauce and the cheese in hand
it's like they're playing a cruel joke on us

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's wrong and we
shouldn't be fighting this fight
but the pineapple pizza is an abomni
ation and

[Chorus]
we'll never be able to unsee the horror
of the pineapple on the pie and the pepperoni too
it's like they're ruining the
sacred tradition of pizza

[Verse 3]
the memories of the good old days are tainted by the
thought of the pineapple pizza invasion and the way it's spreading
like a virus and we're all to blame for not speaking out loud
against this heinous crime against humanity and
pizza culture in general and we'll never be able
to regain our innocence again once we
admit that the pineapple pizza is anything
but a travesty and a disgrace to the pizza world
and we'll never be able to
unsee the horror of it all and the way it
tainted our once perfect
pizza experience and the way it's now forever
marred by the abomination of the pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's wrong and we
shouldn't be fighting this fight but
the pineapple pizza is an abom
ination and we'll never be

[Chorus]
able to unsee the horror of the pineapple
on the pie and the pepperoni too it's like they're ruini
ng the sacred tradit
ion of pizza and we'll ne
ver be able to regain our innocence ag
ain against this heinous crime against humanity and
pizza culture in gene
r and we'll never be able to

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
till you tore it all
down running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paper li
ing here because I remember

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you but
not weeping in a party bathroom
some actress asking me what happened you
that's what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self effacing jo
ks sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come
and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
cause it reminds you of innocence and it
smells like me but you keep it
cause you remember it all too well

[Chorus]
cause there we are again when I loved you
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punchline goes
I'll get older but your lovers stay my age
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bon
es I'm a soldier who's returning half her
weight and did the twin flame bruise paint you
blue just between us did the love affair maim you
too cause in this city's bar
ren cold fall the first snow glistened as it
fell I remember it all too
well and you call me up again

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well wind in my hair
I was there I was there down the stairs I
was there you remember it all too
well and you call me up again just
to break me like a promise so casual
cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper
lying here because I remember
it all too well wind in my hair
I was there I was there down the stairs you
were there you remember it all too
well and you call me up again just
to break me like a promise so
casually cruel in the name of
being honest I'm a crumpled up
piece of paper lying here because
I remember it all too well wind inmy

[Spoken Outro]
