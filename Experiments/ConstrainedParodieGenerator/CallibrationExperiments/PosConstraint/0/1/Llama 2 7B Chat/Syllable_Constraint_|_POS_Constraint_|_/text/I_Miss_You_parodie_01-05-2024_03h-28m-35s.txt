[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the topping from my nightmare
the flavor that doesn't belong on a
the dissonance in the to
the fruit that doesn't belong
on a pizza that's already perfect on
we can have margherita
and barbecue chicken if we want
and we'll have pizza on thanksgiving too
and in the oven we

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the sweetness going to
I cannot taste it without a reason
I need something to complement
this savory pie
and pineapple doesn't do it for me at
all the spices and herbs and
veggies and meats and cheeses
can't mask the flavor of the fruit
it's like a party in my mouth
but the wrong kind of party
will you take it off and stop this pain ton
stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
you're already in a
pizza paradise when
I miss pineapple on a pizza and the
voice inside my head says
no no no no no no

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
you're already in a
pizza paradise when
I miss pineapple on a pizza and the
voice inside my head says
no no no no no no
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
you're already in a
pizza paradise when
I miss pineapple on a pizza and the
voice inside my head says
no no no no no no

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
