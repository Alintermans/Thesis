[Intro]
is this a bad meal or just a fantasy
caught in a dilemma with no escape from this fall
open your eyes and take a bite and seeeeyyhhy
I'm just a poor guy who needs some sympathy
cause I'm easy to dislike with my strong opinions on pine
any way the pizza slices doesn't really matter to me

[Verse 1]
pizza night just went to
put pineapple on top and now it's ruined for goodnights
pizza night had just begun
but now I've gone and thrown it all away
pizza night ohh didn't mean to make you
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my pizza's done
sends shivers down my spine tainting my tongue all the time
goodbye everybody I've got to go
gotta leave you all behind and taste the truth
pizza night ohh I don't wanna
I sometimes wish I'd just
eaten something else tonight instead of this

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little slice of pizza pie so
scaramouche scaramouche will you do the fandango
thunderbolt and lightning never tasted so frightening
galileo galileo galileo figaro yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum I
just want a pizza without pineapple on
he's just a poor guy who wants a normal pie
spare him the pineapple from this monstros
easy come easy go will you let me go
bismillah no we will not let you go
let him go bismillah we will not let you go
let him go bismillah we will not let you go
let me go will not let you go
will not let you go never let
me go oh mamma mia mamma mia oh
pineapple has a special
place in hell for me for me for meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

[Verse 4]
so you think you can force me to eat pineapple
so you think you can ruin my pizza and leave
oh baby can't do this to me baby
just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]
oh
oh yeah oh yeah
nothing really matters anyone can see
nothing really matters
nothing really matters to me
any way the pizza
