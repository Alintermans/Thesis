[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple a treat
on your pizza pie so sweet and neatly meted out in
slivers that look like they could never beat
the classic toppings that have long
reigned supreme in our hearts for so long
have you no taste for the tried and true ways of the past
or are you just trying to make
a statement with that
fruit on your pizza that just doesn't belong there at all and
makes me cringe every time I see it staring

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want to know if you agree or not with
my stance on pineapple on pizza and if you don
t then I'm sad to see you go because I thought
we could bond over our shared love for pizza but

[Chorus]
crawling back to you
ever thought of making a
pizza without
pineapple on
it maybe it
sounds too obvious
but trust me it's worth it to
try it through and see
the difference it

[Verse 2]
so do you have the nerve
to try a pizza without pineapple
and see if it's just as good if not better
simmer down and give it a chance and I promise you'll see
that the classic toppings are the way to go and not that green
abomination that looks like it belongs in a
salad and not on a pizza pie but if you

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want to know if you agree or not with
my stance on pineapple on pizza and if you don
t then I'm sad to see you go because I thought
we could bond over our shared love for pizza but

[Chorus]
crawling back to you ever thought of call
ing when you've had a few slic
es of pizza without pine
apple on it cause I always do
maybe I'm too busy enjoying the
real taste of pizza to fall for
the fake taste of pineapple
now I've thought it through
crawling back to you

[Outro]
do I wanna know if you agree or not with
my stance on pineapple on pizza and if you don
t then I'm sad to see you go because I thought
we could bond over our shared love for pizza but
do I wanna know too busy bein' yours to fall
for the trap of pineapple on pizza ever thought
of callin' me and ordering a real pizza instead
