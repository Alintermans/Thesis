[Verse]
emerging from my denial and I've been doing
just fine without pineapple on my pizza pie
started with a slice that seemed quite nice and fine π by the
slice it was a crime to add pineapple to this
but now I'm pushing food away and feeling quite
sickly while they're enjoying every bite and
chew with glee and my stomach's in a twist and it
all in my head π and

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're devouring it
with relish and delight
let me go
and I just can't bear it seeing pine
on my pizza night

[Chorus]
disgustation turning foodies into
sourpusses swimming through a
sickly sweet illusion but
it's just the cost of my ref
usal to accept the trend
of pineapple on pizza
it's a travesty

[Guitar Solo]
