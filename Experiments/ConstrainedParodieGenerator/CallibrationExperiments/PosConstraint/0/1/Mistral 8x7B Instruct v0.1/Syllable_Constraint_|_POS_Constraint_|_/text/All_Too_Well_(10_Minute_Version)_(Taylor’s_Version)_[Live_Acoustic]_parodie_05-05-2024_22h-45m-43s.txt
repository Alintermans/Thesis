[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my appetite at the table
that monstrosity should not be allowed now

[Verse 2]
oh that sweet and savory clash of flavors so wrong
the ham and pineapple duet in my mouth
autumn leaves of disappointment falling down like
a bad dream after which I woke up with a

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that culinary sin is
a blight on my tongue forevermore oh oh oh
it's a crime

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on that poor pizza
a travesty of taste that should be banned for life I swear it
ham and pineapple never
tasted so vile I remember

[Verse 3]
toppings scattered on the counter like a messy crime scene
you used to be a dish with dignity supreme now defamed by pine
and your mother's telling stories of pizza's glory days gone
you told me about tradition but you never told
me it would taste like this abomination in disguise oh
the horror of it all I remember it all
too well and then you wondered why I pushed it away
but all I felt was disgust and you held the slice of shame
in your hand oh oh oh oh oh
it's a sin and you call me up again just
to remind me of the cul
inary atrocity oh so casually un
derhanded in the name of being honest I'm a

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there it is again in the middle of the
night we're cringing at the sight of it in the kitchen light oh
the shame the horror and
we'd swear to never ever let
pineapple near our pizza again yeah yeah yeah
it's a sin and there it is again when nobody had
to know you kept it like
a dirty secret but I kept you

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you topped it all up
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time I think of pineapple
on pizza it makes me want to yell and scream and shout and holler and
how could anyone do this
to a perfectly good pizza slice oh the
idea of pineapple on pizza who was he a monster without
a soul that's what happened you oh the
horror of it all and then you wondered
where it went wrong as
I reached for a slice of real pizza oh but
all I felt was disgust and you held the slice of
shame in your hand oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
it's a sin and you call me up again just to remind

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my dignity and I walk home
alone but you keep my old scarf from that very
first slice oh because it reminds you of ignorance
and it smells like denial
you can't get rid of it oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it is again when I loved you
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare you were there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at hiding my disgust but the punch
line goes pineapple on pizza is a sin
from when your carelessness broke my trust and
my faith in humanity oh I'm a sol
dier who's returning half her weight
and did the pineapple stain ruin the pizza
oh just between us did it
maim you too oh just between us do you
remember it all too well oh
just between us I remember

[Outro]
it all too well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
wind in my hair I was there I was there oh oh oh
down the stairs I was there I was there oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
sacred prayer I was there I was there oh
it was rare you remember it oh
wind in my hair I was there I was
there oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
down the stairs I was there I was there oh
sacred prayer I was there I was there
oh it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair I was there oh
down the stairs I was there I was there oh
sacred prayer I was there I was there
oh it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair I was there oh
down the stairs I was there I was there oh
sacred prayer I was there I was there
oh it was rare you remember it
all too well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Spoken Outro]
I hate pineapple on
