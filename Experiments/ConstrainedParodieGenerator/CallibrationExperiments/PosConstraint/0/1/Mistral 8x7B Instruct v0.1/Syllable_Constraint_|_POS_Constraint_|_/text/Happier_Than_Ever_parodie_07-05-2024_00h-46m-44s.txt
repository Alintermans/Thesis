[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue and mad
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just shouldn't be

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a parody verse
to tell you why it's such a
faux pas to put pineapple
on a pizza you adore it
but I'm here to set it straight for
you and others like you who
don't know any better yet don't say it
isn't true it's just a fact that it's a
travesty on a pizza pie don't you see it too yeah you do
and I know you'll come around
to my way of thinking soon
cause it's just not right to put pineapple on pizza
it's a crime that's plain to see so

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue and
mad wish I could explain it clearer but it just shouldn
't be true mmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmm
hmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmh

[Verse 2]
you top your pizza high with pineap
please just stop the madness now it's time
to face the facts and change your ways before it
gets out of hand and ruins pizza for
everyone out there it's just
not right to put pineapple on
a pizza it's a sin and you
know it's true so just admit

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about pineapple on the net
never told anyone anything good
cause that shit's embarrassing it's a travesty
on a pizza pie and all that you did was
make me question humanity so don
't waste your time trying to change my mind
cause I won't budge on this one it's a hill I'm willing to
die on and I know I'm not alone so just leave it
alone and find a new topping to call your own yeah just
leave the pineapple off the pizza and we

[Outro]
will all be better off you
ruined everything good always said
you were misunderstood made
all my pizza moments sour just leave
me
alone
ah
ah ah
ah ah
