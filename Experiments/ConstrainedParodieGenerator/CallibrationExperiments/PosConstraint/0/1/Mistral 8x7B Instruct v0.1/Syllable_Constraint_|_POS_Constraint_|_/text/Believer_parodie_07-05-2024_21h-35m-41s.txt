[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
its taste is a curseakkari
on a classic pie it shouldna
on a classic pie it shouldna

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare tell me it's a delicacy
it's a travesty and
a mockery of culinary
a mockery of culinar

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on pies that were true
tomato sauce and mozzarella
but pineapple just won't do
it's a disgrace to the cellarla la la la la
a disgrace to the cellarla
singing my protest from the heart
an abomination to keep
apart from the fresh pepperon

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer la
in the sanctity of
pizza pies we must defend her la
against the pineapple
pain you made me a believer la la la
in the purity of pizza dough
pain you made me a believer la
against the pineapple

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the pizza gods up
high to spare us from this
desecration of the sacred supper
the sacred supper la la la

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on pies that were
honest and true and fine and fair
but pineapple just won't fare
it's a disaster to compare
it's a disaster to compare la la la la la
to the margherita and the marinara la la la
and the pepper

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer la
in the sanctity of
pizza pies we must defend her la
against the pineapple
pain you made me a believer la la la
in the purity of pizza dough
pain you made me a believer la
against the pineapple

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the pizza gods above
pineapple has no place on
a classic pie that we love
a classic pie that we love

[Pre-Chorus]
and the protest will never subside la la la la
until the pineapple is cast aside la la la la la
and the pizza

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer la
in the sanctity of
pizza pies we must defend her la
against the pineapple
pain you made me a believer la la la
in the purity of pizza dough
pain you made me a believer la
against the pineapple
