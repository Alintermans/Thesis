[Intro]
come on now folks and give an ear to me a tale

[Verse 1]
taste sensation
pineapple's not a valid
option for a pizza topping please believe
it just doesn't fit the blend we
need to make a
gourmet meal and not a travest
y so let's just leave it be
and not put it on our pizza pie

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
call the chef and
tell him to forget the fruit
it's just not meant to be on pizza you
see it's not the way to go
imagine bit
ing into a slice and getting
ham and pineapple oh no
that's not a tasty treat for sure you know it

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go ahead and try it if you dare but
I don't wanna hear about the way it made you
feel it's just not worth the risk my friend and
I don't wanna hear about how it ruined your

[Outro]
he
y it's not
he same as it was before you tried
it on your pizza pie
