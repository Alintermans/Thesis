[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni and cheese
but pineapple just won
through reputation
it doesn't deserve to
be on a pizza pie like this one does belong here

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said taste is subjective
and I can't deny
I'm not looking for a topping
that will make me wonderwhy
it's on my pizza
underneath the cheese
just something to complete it
something I can se
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doododo doododo
doododo doo do
doododo doododo
oh I want something just like this
doododo doododo
doododo doo do
doododo doododo
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
but pineapple just won
it doesn't deserve to
be on a pizza pie
it's not tradition true
I'm not the kind of person that it fits with

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
they said where do you wanna go
how much do you wanna
risk putting pineapple on your
favorite pizza oh no
I'm not looking for
a topping that will
make me question why I ate
something so unholy

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doododo doododo
doododo doo do
doododo doododo
oh I want something just like this
doododo doododo
doododo doo do
doododo doododo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where do you wanna
go how much do you want
to risk putting pineapple on
your pizza no way jose
I'm not looking for
a topping that will
make me regret my choice and
miss the classic taste of
something just like this oh no

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
