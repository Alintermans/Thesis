[Intro]
I think I've had it now with pine on
that cheesy dish you call a fe
I'm through with this debate on taste bud
I think it's time to set things
straight for good

[Verse]
I've tasted two pies before this
can't pretend that I enjoyed it one bit oh my word
the thought of pineapple on pizza
if I could change it all back would I even
miss it at all well broken taste
buds break traditions so break the cycle fast and I don
't wanna give in so in my mouth it'll
rot I've tasted two pies before this can't pretend that I
enjoyed it one bit oh my word
the thought of pineapple on pizza if I could change it
all back would I even miss it at
all well broken taste buds break traditions so
break the cycle fast and I don
't wanna give in so in my mouth it'll rot in my grave
I'll rot I'll rot I'll rot is my pain your
freedom is all of my pain your freedom enjoy it all you

[Chorus]
in my mouth it'll
rot rot rot inmy
mouth it'll rot rot rot in
my mouth it'll rot
rot rot rot inmy mouth it
'll rot rot rot inmy

[Outro]
in my mouth it'll
rot rot rot is my pain
your freedom enjoy it
all you want but don't say I
didn't
