[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice foot
now in the morning I take a bite
of a pizza that just ain

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to love the taste
but now it's ruined by the pineap
stuck in every bite like
a thorn in my side I can't escape
one bite in and I feel bet
the sweetness turned to regret
and I discovered that my crust is soft
upon a base of bad decisions aloft

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
the choir of pizza lovers sing
be my savior from this messy
pizza that I can't digestedly
for some reason I can't explain
once I tried the pineapple
never again a slice
that was when I ruled my taste bud

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a mistake so grandi
blew away the joy of pizza
shattered my faith in toppings true blue
people couldn't believe what I'd doozeen
revelers wait for my ap
just a fool on a slippery
slope of pineapple I can't abide aw
who would ever wanna eat this way

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
the choir of pizza lovers sing
be my savior from this messy
pizza that I can't digestibly
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't call my name
never again a slice
that was when I ruled my taste bud

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
hear the bells of disappointment ring
oh oh oh oh oh oh
the choir of pizza lovers sing
oh oh oh oh oh oh
be my savior from this messy
oh oh oh oh oh oh
pizza that I can't digestibly
oh oh oh oh oh oh
for some reason I can't explain
oh oh oh oh oh oh
I know saint peter won't call my name
never again a slice
that was when I ruled my taste bud
