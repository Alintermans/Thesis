[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine line gotta
draw the line before it's drowned in pineapple supreme time to
speak up and say no way it's just not okay on pizza
well little one I don't want
to admit to something if all it's gonna cause
is pain the truth and pine

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's coming home with pineapple on his slice
sweat jackets and jeans mismatched on
his plate a mess of pineapple and
cheese he's a disgrace to pizza lovers and now
he's paying for his mistake he can't believe
it's true he's eating pineapple pizza
it's a disgrace she just wants to get away from him and
try some real pizza she's had enough of pineapple on pizza so
she's leaving him behind and
ordering pizza without pineapple tonight she is
done with him and his pineapple ways she's moving
on and finding someone who appreciates real pizza
not the fake kind with pineapple
on top she's saying goodbye to him and hello to
pizza perfection without pineapple she's free at last from his
pineapple obsession and she's never looked
back she's living her best pizza life now

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine line gotta
draw the line before it's drowned in pineapple supreme time to
speak up and say no way it's just not okay on pizza
well little one I don't want
to admit to something if all it's gonna cause
is pain the truth and pine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand it
was come morning time to scram now we hug tight and
he's still eating pineapple pizza she can
t believe it's true she thought he was better
than that but now she knows he's not she's had enough of
his pineapple ways and she's leaving him behind she
can't take it anymore she deserves better than a
pizza with pineapple on it she's worth more than that she's a real pizza
lover and she knows it she's not gonna settle for less than the best
pizza without pineapple on it she
deserves a slice of heaven not a slice of hell with
pineapple on it she's moving on and finding someone who
appreciates real pizza not the fake kind
