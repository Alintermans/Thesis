[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we
must face this culinary war
you might think it's tasty but it's a flawed notion
it looks absurd on a pie
it's just not right my friend way

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we ask
why is pineapple on pizza a task
that we can't seem to
outrun or outlast we've tasted it
before but still we ask why is pine on
pizza such a bore we

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
face this culinary fight we
must get away from this sight we gotta
get away from this mess we must
get away from this curse we got

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and join the fun
it's a culinary climb
things will taste better without
remember it's a sin to put pine on
a pizza we can find a
better match somewhere far from

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we ask
why is pineapple on pizza a task
that we can't seem to
outrun or outlast we've tasted it
before but still we ask why is pine on
pizza such a bore we

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
face this culinary fight we
must get away from this sight we gotta get
away from this mess we must get
away from this curse we got to

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we ask
why is pineapple on pizza a task
that we can't seem to
outrun or outlast we've tasted it
before but still we ask why is pine on
pizza such a bore we

[Bridge]
we don't taste enough
we should explore and
expand our food front
will we ever learn
we've tasted before
it's just not worth it

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on we
must get away from this
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got
to get away we got to get
away we got to get away
