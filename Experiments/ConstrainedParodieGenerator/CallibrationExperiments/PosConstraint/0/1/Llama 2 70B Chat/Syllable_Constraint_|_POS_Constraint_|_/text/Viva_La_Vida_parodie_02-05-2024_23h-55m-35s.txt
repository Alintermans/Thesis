[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza
toppings would pile high and higher
now it's just a memory makes me
want to cry and shed a te

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to think hawai
was the perfect combo but now it
makes me want to vomit and
never eat another pizza again
one minute it was my fav
next it was my worst nightmare
and I discovered that pineapple doesn
t belong on a pizza crust standing on

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple haters shouting la
la la la la la la la la la
be my pizza guide don't let
pineapple abide la la la la la
for some reason I can't explain
pineapple on pizza is
just a sin la la la
and that was when I loved pizza

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild cra
ving that made me try it and now
I'm filled with regret and sorrow drums
people can't believe I'd stoop so low
revolutionaries wait
for pineapple to go away
just a topping on a lonely plate mm ma
who would ever wanna eat that way

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple haters shouting la
la la la la la la la la la
be my pizza guide don't let
pineapple abide la la la la la
for some reason I can't explain
pineapple on pizza is just a sin
la la la la la la
and that was when I loved pizza

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
hear pineapple haters shouting la
la la la la la la
be my pizza guide don't let pin
apple abide la la
for some reason I can't ex
plain pineapple on a
pizza is just a sin la la la la
la la la la la la
and that was when I loved pizza so
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh disturbingly
bad combination oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh no no

[Outro]
mmm mmm mmm good
