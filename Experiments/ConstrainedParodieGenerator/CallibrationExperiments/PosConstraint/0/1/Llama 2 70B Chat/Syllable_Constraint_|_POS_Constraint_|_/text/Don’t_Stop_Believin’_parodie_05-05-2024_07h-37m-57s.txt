[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie sitin' in the oven ton
a topping so wrong it's like a crime scene gone
pineapple's the culprit it's a flavor faux pas
it doesn't belong on a pizza that's just

[Verse 2]
a travesty in the makin
a pizza so fake it's like a
bad rendition of a classic
it's a pizza crime it's a pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waitin
up and down the block people
their taste buds searchin in the night
pizza joints liv
in' just to make a buck people
hidin' somewhere in the sau

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to make a pie
everybody wants it to
taste just right but pineapple's a lie
it's just not worth

[Verse 4]
some will win some will lose
some are born to make the sau
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waitin
up and down the block people
their taste buds searchin in the night
pizza joints liv
in' just to make a buck people
hidin' somewhere in the sau

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin
hold on to that feelin
pizza people
don't stop believin
hold on
pizza people
don't stop believin
hold on to that feelin
pizza people
