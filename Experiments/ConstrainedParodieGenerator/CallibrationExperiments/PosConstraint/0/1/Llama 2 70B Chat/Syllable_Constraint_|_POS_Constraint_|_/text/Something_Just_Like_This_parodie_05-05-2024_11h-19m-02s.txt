[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for
a long time now it's true
but there's one topping that
I just can't get through
it's the pineapple
it's just not right ia
it doesn't belong on a pie ia ia iah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go I
don't know how much more
I can take of this pineapple
it's just not what I adore
I'm not looking for
a fruit that's so sweet
I need something more savour
something that's truly neat
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just
like this doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something
just like this doo doo do
oo doo doo doo doo doo doo do
oo doo doo doo doo doo do

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
of old and new ia
the pizza toppings they
all say the same ia
no pineapple in sight
it's just not right ia
it doesn't belong on a pie ia iah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go I
don't know how much more
I can take of this pineapple
it's just not what I adore
I'm not looking for
a fruit that's so sweet
I need something more savour
something that's truly neat

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like
this doo doo doo doo doo do

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just
like this doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something
just like this doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for ia iah
some superhuman gifts iah
some superhero
some fairytale iah
just something I can turn to
somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
