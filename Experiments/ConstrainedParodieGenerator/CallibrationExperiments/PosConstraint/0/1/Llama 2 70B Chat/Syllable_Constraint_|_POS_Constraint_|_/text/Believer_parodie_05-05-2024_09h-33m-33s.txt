[Verse 1]
first things first
I got a message that's burning in me
I'm fired up and tired of
the way that pizza's been treated
the way that pizza's been treated

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you tell me what you think that I should eat
I'm the one who knows what
I want on my pie that's neat oh oh
the master of my taste buds oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was hungry from a young age
taking my cravings to the fridge door
writing my recipes for the
few that look at me took to me shook at me feeling
singing from my heart about the
pain of a pineapple on a
pizza taking my message from
the oven to the table see

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer belie
ver pizza you break me down you build
me up believer bel
ver pizza oh let the toppings fall oh let
them rain my taste my love my craving
it came from pizza you made me a
you made me a belie

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the chef up above
all the hate that I've heard
has turned my stomach into a dove oh
oh my stomach up above oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was choking in the crowd
building my hunger up in the
cloud falling like crumbs to the ground
hoping my cravings they would brown
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited till it broke open and rained down
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer belie
ver pizza you break me down you build
me up believer bel
ver pizza oh let the toppings fall oh let
them rain my taste my love my craving
it came from pizza you made me a

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the oven and the heat
you're the face of the future
the sauce in my veins oh oh
the sauce in my veins oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited till it broke open and rained down
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer belie
ver pizza you break me down you build
me up believer bel
ver pizza oh let the toppings fall oh let
them rain my taste my love my craving
