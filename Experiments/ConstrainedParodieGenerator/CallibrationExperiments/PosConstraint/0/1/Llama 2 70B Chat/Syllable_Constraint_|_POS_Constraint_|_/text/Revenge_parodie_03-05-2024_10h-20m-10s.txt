[Intro]
I think I've found a way to express
my feelings about pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime against
humanity it's such a
disaster

[Verse]
I've seen the horrors of hawai
ian pizza it's a travesty to me people put
pineapple on their pizza and they
act like it's no big deal but it's a sin to
me it's like they're trying to ru
in the sanctity of this beautiful dish it's just not
right it's like they're trying to break my heart
and they don't even care how I feel about it at all
they just wanna be different
and stand out from the crowd but not in a good way no not
at all it's just a shame it's a dam
n shame what has the world come to when people
can't even follow simple
rules of culinary decency it's just not right it
makes me wanna rot in my grave just think
ing about it oh the humanity the injustice of

[Chorus]
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rot ot ot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rot ot ot
in my grave I'll rot

[Outro]
in my grave I'll rot
I'll rot I'll rot I'll rot
is my suffering your
pleasure is my pain your freedom
