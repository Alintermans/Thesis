[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' with glee every bite you take
do you ever get that feelin' that it
just don't belong like a fruit
that's not supposed to be savory and
sticks out like a sore thumb like a hawaiian pizza
are there some flavors up your sle
that you're tryin' to
hide from me have you no Idea that It's just not right I
dream of pizza with real toppings nearly ev'ry

[Pre-Chorus]
night this week how many toppings can you stack on
'cause there's this taste I found that makes me think of you somehow
an' I play it on repeat until my taste bud
spillin' flavors on my tongue ev'ry single time you

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to bas
ics crawlin' back to what we
know crawlin' back
to the way it
should be crawlin
back to you maybe
I'm too busy lovin' pe
pperoni to fall
for somethin' new now

[Verse 2]
so have you got the gut
s to take a stand and admit that it
s just not right and if so I want to know
what time it shuts down the pizza shop for good simmer down
an' pucker up I'm sorry to interrupt but I'm constan
tly on the cusp of tryin' to taste the real deal but
I don't know if you feel the same as I do

[Pre-Chorus]
night this week how many toppings can you stack on
'cause there's this taste I found that makes me think of you somehow
an' I play it on repeat until my taste bud
spillin' flavors on my tongue ev'ry single time you

[Chorus]
but we could be together if you want
ed to crawlin' back to bas
ics crawlin' back to what we
know crawlin' back to the way it should
be crawlin' back to you maybe I'm too
busy lovin' pepperoni
to fall for somethin' new now
I've thought it through and
I'm still not convinced

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this feelin' flows both ways
sad to see you go was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
baby we both know that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
do I wanna know too busy bein' yours to fall
ever thought of callin' darlin' do you want me craw
lin' back to you do you want me crawlin' back to you do
