[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain it clear
it doesn't belong there

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to collect my thought before I
start to rant about this ab
horrent topping that they dare
to call a pizza topping
do you even read the menu
or do you just ignore the rules
when you ordered a pepper
oni and sausage too what were you thinking of
you said you wanted something new but this
is just a travesty I can't believe I'm looking at this ab
omination it's like a
personal attack on me
and I'm not even kidding when I say this is a
threat to our society

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain it clear it doesn't bel
ong there I wish it wasn't true but it's a fact that we can't
ignore this topping needs to

[Verse 2]
you call me a hater or a pur
ist but I don't care I'll stand up
for what is right even if it means I'm fight
ing a losing battle this isn't a
trend or a fad it's a dis
tortion of the classic pizza
formula that we all know and
love don't try to rein vent

[Verse 3]
the wheel or fix what ain't broke don't try to make a
healthy option out of a greasy treat
we don't want your tropical fruit toppings we
want our pepperoni and mushrooms and
sausage too don't pretend that this is
something new and exciting when it
clearly is not don't insult our intelligence with
this abomination just leave our pizza al
one don't try to make it something it's not and never
will be just stick to the classics and we'll be

[Outro]
fine but don't say we didn
't warn you when we see pineapple on
a pizza we'll speak out loud
and clear this is a crime against human
kind
ah don
'task
us to
accept
