[Intro]
come on folks we wanna say goodnight to you all

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's taste is all wrong on
the top it doesn't belong on a roll call
why don't we leave it alone
no more debate
when everyone hates the flavor
it's hard to replace the great
and we're the ones who'll savor every

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple lovers answer
why are you insisting on your stand on
a savory dish that's a
ring of disdain
and nobody's coming to save
our classic pies from the
pineapple invasion oh oh oh no no

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home cooks make your own creation fast
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave tradition two chefs follow the trend
I don't wanna talk about who's doing it first

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was as it was as
it was not the same as
