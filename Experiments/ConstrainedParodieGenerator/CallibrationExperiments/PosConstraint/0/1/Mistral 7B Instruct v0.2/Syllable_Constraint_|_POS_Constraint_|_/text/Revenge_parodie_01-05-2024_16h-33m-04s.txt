[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a pizza topping that was sound
but now I see the error of that
pineapple on a pizza
you agree

[Verse]
I've ordered pies with ham and pe
pepperoni and mushroom galore but now I see the
oh man what a world the things I've seen
if I could remove that pineapple from the
scene would I do it again some
add pineapple some find it quite a treat but I'd have thought
that I would let it be but pineapple
on a pizza breaks the harmony I've ordered pies with ham
and pepperoni and mushroom
galore but now I see the things I've seen if I could change
that topping combination would I
do it again some add pineapple some find
it quite a treat but I'd have thought
that I would let it be but pineapple on a pizza
breaks the harmony I've ordered pies with
ham and pepperoni and mushroom galore but now I see

[Chorus]
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rototot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rototot
in my grave I'll rot

[Outro]
in my grave I'll rot
I'll rot I'll rot I'll rot
is my dislike your joy
is all of my dislike your joy
enjoy
