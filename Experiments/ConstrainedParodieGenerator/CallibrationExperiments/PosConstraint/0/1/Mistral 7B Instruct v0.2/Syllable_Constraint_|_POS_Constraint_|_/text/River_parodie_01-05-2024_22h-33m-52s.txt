[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need holy water from the pineapple's juice
well little one I don't want
to admit to something so absurd and bizarre
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's bringing home a pineapple slice in a
dishes mismatched with the rest of
the toppings on his plate he's a pine
apple addict and she just wants to react and
get back it's a battle of taste and preference
but she's kept track of all his online sear
ches and guess who just happens to be moving on to the
next with a pepperoni delight she's a lover of tradition
and you don't mess with a
man's pizza choice even I know that but she's devised some
plan to sabotage his dish with a pineapple
knife in hand says their relationship's hanging by a thread
so she's been on the web lately
says maybe she'll be my vegetarian delight
and I know she's using me to try to play him I don't care
hi suzanne but I shoulda said goodbye suz
anne after the first bite but tonight I

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need holy water from the pineapple's juice
well little one I don't want
to admit to something so absurd and bizarre
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one bite turned a two bite stand it was
come sunlight scram now we hug tight and then he found
out now she feels betrayed and used because he
left so what he left her with a pineapple
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and sue
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the studio like a hole in the wall diner
don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
is irreversible I preyed on your love for pineapple
and now that I got you I don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do I do this thing that I do
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
pineapple and cheese is burning the wound
'cause now with her in the wom
b we can't bring her in this world shoulda
known to use protection before I bit into your forbid
den

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need holy water from the pineapple's juice
well little one I don't want
to admit to something so absurd and bizarre
truth and my lies now are

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if pineapple was a
highway and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in
five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice
maybe that's why I may have came at you
sideways I can't keep these
lies straight but I made you terminate the
baby this love triangle left us in a wreck
tangled what else can I say it was fun for
a while did I really wanna top
our pizza with pineapple no I didn
t really wanna abort but fuck it what

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need
holy pine
apple juice feel it washing over me
well little
one I don't want to admit
to something so absurd and bizarre truth and mine
lies now are falling like
