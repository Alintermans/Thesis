[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping fiasco I'm stuck in this culinary
landslide with no escape from this debate pie
I'm just a simple palate I need no em
pathy because I'm easy eat easy leave little high or
low any way the sauce flows doesn't really matter to me to

[Verse 1]
papa just put a pine
apple on my pizza pie put a fork against my will
papa pizza life had just
begun but now I've gone and ruined it
papa ooh didn't mean to make you sigh
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my taste has come
sends shivers down my palate sweet or savory a
time aching all the time goodbye my friends
gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
papa ooh any way the sauce flows
I don't wanna eat
sometimes wish I'd never tasted pineapple

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouette of a dish
pepperoni man pepperoni man will you do
the fandango tomato sauce and cheese so frightening
me galore galore galore pepperoni king galore but I'm just a simple palate nobody loves me
he's just a simple palate from a simple
family spare him his taste from this monstros
ity easy eat easy leave will you
let me go bismillah no we will not let
you go let him go bismillah we will
not let you go let him go bismillah we will
not let you go let me go will not let you go
never never never never
never let me go oh mamma
mia let me go beelzebub has a flavor
put aside for me for me
for me pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie

[Verse 4]
so you think you can top me and serve me a pie
so you think you can love me and leave me to die
oh baby can't do this to me baby
just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]
o
oh yeah ooh yeah
nothing really matters anyone can see
nothing really matters
nothing really matters to me
any way the sauce flows
