twenty five years with this strange
tryin' to figure out why pineapple on
a pizza is such a
mystery to me and you know I've tried
to understand this brotherhood of taste preference
for whatever that means

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm in the kitchen
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I feel a little peculiar standing here

and so I open up the fridge and I step inside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream out to the universe
