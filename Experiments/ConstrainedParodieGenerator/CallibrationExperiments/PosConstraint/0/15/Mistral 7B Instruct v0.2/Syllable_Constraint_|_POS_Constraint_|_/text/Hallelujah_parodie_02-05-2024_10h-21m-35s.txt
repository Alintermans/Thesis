[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that hawaii cooked and it caused a
disagreeable surprise for ya it goes like
this pineapple first then cheese and
tomatoes next the slippery
slide of flavors none can resist the hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 2]
your taste was bold but you demanded
proof pineapple on a pizza
seemed absurd but then it command ya they spread
it on the dough with savory
toppings pineapple changed the game and
from your palate drew the hallelujah pie

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 3]
you say it broke the pizza code
I don't even understand
but if I did why should it matter to ya
there's a harmony in every bite
it doesn't depend on the sight
the sweet and the savory hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't
good I couldn't taste so I tried to

and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the pizza king
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Outro]
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Additional Lyrics]
bite we drew was halleluj
but maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love was how to
