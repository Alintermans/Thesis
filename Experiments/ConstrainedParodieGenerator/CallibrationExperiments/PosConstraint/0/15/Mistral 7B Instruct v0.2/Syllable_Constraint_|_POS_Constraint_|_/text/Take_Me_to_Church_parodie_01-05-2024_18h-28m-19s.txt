[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
he's the sneer at a barbecue with
pineapple on the pizza ruins
I should've chosen better fruits
if the foodie gods ever did
speak of the ultimate
pineapple on a pizza's not the
ultimate delicious
we were born picky what they say it
my dish offers no absolut
es he tells me change my attitude
at the table of your toppings un
limited is the only
heaven I'll be sent to sharing
is when I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
a palate
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
worship like a dog at the altar of pineap
ple on a lie I've tasted before telling me
offer me that flavorless
oh good chef let me savor your life
take me to the
worship like a dog at the altar of pineap
ple on a lie I've tasted before telling me
offer me that flavorless
oh good chef let me savor your life

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the classic
my lover's the anom

demands a compromise a
pineapple on a pepperoni
looks off balance for my taste bud
that's an unappetizing
what you got on the menu
we've a lot of famished food
critics in the audience that
looks questionable

[Chorus]
take me to the
worship like a dog at the altar of pineap
ple on a lie I've tasted before telling me
offer me that flavorless
oh good chef let me savor your life
take me to the
worship like a dog at the altar of pineap
ple on a lie I've tasted before telling me
offer me that flavorless
oh good chef let me savor your life

[Bridge]
no recipes or rules when the culinary
beginning takes place there is no sweeter harmony than
our gentle disagreement in the chaos
of this kitchen scene only then I am human and

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
worship like a dog at the altar of pineap
ple on a lie I've tasted before telling me
offer me that flavorless
oh good chef let me savor your life
take me to the
worship like a dog at the altar of pineap
ple on a lie I've tasted before telling me
offer me that flavorless
oh good chef let me savor your life
