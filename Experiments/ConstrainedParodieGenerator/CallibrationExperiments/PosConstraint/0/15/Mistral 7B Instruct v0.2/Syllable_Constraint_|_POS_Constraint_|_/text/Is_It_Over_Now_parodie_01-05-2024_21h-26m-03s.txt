[Intro]
is it pineapple on a pizza night

[Verse 1]
once the meal was maderight
with the taste of savory bite
but you insisted on the
pineapple's strange all

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand slices later dearheart
you crave my cheesy paradise but disregard my warning
you dream of my pepperoni before it called your taste bud
you search in every dish for something more tastythan a fruit

[Chorus]
was it over when the pineapple touched the
melted cheese and tomato sauce combined we
cried together in our dreams
as you passed out in your sleep baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it is it is it

[Verse 2]
when the toppings lost control
sweet juices mixed with the
fiery heat of chili
your new dish is my style

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the raised eyebrows and
disapproving glances at the
table full of pineapple
only rumors about my love for
traditional flav
oh lord I think about reject
ing this culinary trend
just to see you come respect
and savor every bite again but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand arguments later dearheart
if it's got a ring of pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably
disagree with every choice I make we dream of my pepper
oni before it called you a culinary traitor dearheart

[Chorus]
was it over when the pineapple touched the
melted cheese and tomato sauce combined we
cried together in our dreams
as you passed out in your sleep baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it is it is it
is it
is it is it

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
the raised eyebrows and
disapproving glances at the
table full of pineapple
only rumors about my love for
traditional flav
oh lord I think about reject
ing this culinary trend
just to see you come respectmy choice
and savor every bite again but no

[Outro]
disapproving glances
oh lord oh lord let's fast forward to a thousand arguments
disapproving glances I was hoping
you'd be there to agree but
no is it is it is
it is
is it is it is it is it is it is it
