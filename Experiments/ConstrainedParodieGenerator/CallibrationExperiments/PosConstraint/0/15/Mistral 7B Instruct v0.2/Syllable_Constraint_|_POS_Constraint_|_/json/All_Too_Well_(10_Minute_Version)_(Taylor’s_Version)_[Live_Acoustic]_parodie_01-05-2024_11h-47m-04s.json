your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nI love you guys so much [/INST]\nParody:\n[Verse 1]\nI walked through the door with you both hand in hand\nbut something about it wasn't right somehow\na slice of pineapple on your pizza pie\nnow ruins the taste for me every time\n\n[Verse 2]\noh pineapple on pizza and my wide puzzled gaze\nwe were singing in the car questioning the\nstrange combination of flavors falling down like\ndiscordant notes in the harmony of a\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I know it's commonplace\nbut I can't help but feel\npineapple on pizza is a mistake at best\noh oh oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'cause there we are again on this controversial\ntopic in the middle of a heated debate essential\npineapple on pizza or\nI remember it all too\n\n[Verse 3]\nphoto album on the table our faces turned in\ndisgust as we recall the first time you tried it in high school giggles\nand your friend's mother telling stories of her love for pineap\nplease don't put it on my pizza pie again we\nused to be a team but now it seems we're adversaries in\npizza land as I reach for the pepperoni\nand I was thinking on the drive home any time now\nyou'll admit it's a mistake but you never call it what\nit is until it's too late and\nthen you wonder where it went to as I reach\nfor the vegetarian\nbut all I feel is disappointment and you hold my hand\nand all I can think is why oh why did it have to\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I know it's commonplace\nbut I can't help but feel changed\npineapple on pizza is a mistake\noh oh oh I remember it\n\n[Chorus]\n'cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nwe're arguing in the kitchen in the refrigerator\nlight pineapple on the\nI remember it all too well\nand there we are again when nobody wanted to\nknow you kept me like a secret but I kept you like a\nloyal companion and\nwe'd swear to remember it all too\n\n[Bridge]\nwell maybe we got lost in translation\nmaybe I asked for too much\nbut maybe this culinary master\npiece was ruined with\nrunning scared I was there\nI remember it all too well\nand you called me up again just to break me like a promise\nso casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up menu lying here tonight\n'cause I remember it all all all\n\n[Verse 4]\nthey say all's fair in love and war but I'm in a new\nbattlefield every time you order\nwith pineapple on it I say if we had agreed on the basics\nof pizza making maybe\nit would have been fine but now it's a constant\nreminder of our differences and the divide that grew between\nus the idea you had of me\na lover of traditional pizzas\nnot someone who would\ntolerate such an abomination on\na perfectly good pizza pie but now I'm forced\nto remember it all too well every time I take a bite\nand you can't get rid of it because you remember\n\n[Verse 5]\ntime won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to go back to the days before pineapple on pizza came\ninto existence but I'm still trying to find it\nafter pepperoni days and nights when you made\nme your own now you order without me andi\nwalk home alone but you keep my old favorite to\npping I can't get rid of\n'cause you remember it all too well yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'cause there we are again when I hated you\nso before you ruined the one real thing you've ever\nknown it was rare I was\nI remember it all too well\npineapple on pizza oh\nyou remember it all\npineapple on pizza\nI remember it all\nit was rare I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 6]\nand I was never good at finding solutions but the punch\nline goes pineapple on pizza I'll never\nget older but your preferences stay\nthe same from when our friendship was tested\nand pineapple on pizza broke the\nbond between us I'm a skeptical eater who\nponders the implications\nof such a divisive ingredient\non the sacred institution\nof pizza and how it affects\n\n[Outro]\njust between us did the introduction of pineapple\non pizza ruin it all too well for you too just\nbetween us do you remember it all too well just between us\npineapple on pizza I remember\nit all too well pineapple on the\nI remember it all too well pine\napple on pizza I remember it all\ntoo well pineapple on pizza I was\nthere I remember it all too
