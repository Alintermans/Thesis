[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to forget that sin
of putting pineapple on pizza

[Verse]
I've tasted two tastes for us me
can't pretend that it was tasty leaving me in mis

I hear if I could take it back would I it
some swear off pineapple for life
and you would've thought I'd learn and leave it be and let it
rest in peace I've tasted two tastes
for us me can't pretend that it was tasty leaving me
in misery oh man what a
dish the things I hear if I could take it back would I it
some swear off pineapple for life and
you would've thought I'd learn and leave it be and
let it rest in peace I don't
want to give it another chance so in my trash can it
rots I've tasted two tastes for us me can
t pretend that it was tasty leaving me in misery

[Chorus]
in my trash can it
rots in my trash can

my trash can it rots ot ot
