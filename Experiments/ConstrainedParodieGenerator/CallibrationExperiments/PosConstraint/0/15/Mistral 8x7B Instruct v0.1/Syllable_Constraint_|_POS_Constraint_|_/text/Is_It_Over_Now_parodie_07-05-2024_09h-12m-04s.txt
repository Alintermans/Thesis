[Intro]
should pineapple belong on a pizza

[Verse 1]
when the box is delivered
with the cheese and tomato sauce
an anomaly appeared
the sweet and savour

[Pre-Chorus]
fast forward to three hundred slices later oughughough
you see the pineapple grinning oughoughoughoughoughoughough
it doesn't belong with the pepperoni oughoughoughough
it's a disgrace to the pizza culture baby oughoughoughough

[Chorus]
was it wrong to put pineapple on the dough
was it wrong to ignore the pizza code ough
come on now don't be a fool
in your dreams as you devour ough
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
should pineapple belong

[Verse 2]
when you take a bite and taste
the sweetness of the fruit
your tastebuds are confused
it's a monstrosity

[Bridge]
and did you think I wouldn't notice
the pineapple on
at least I had the decency
to stick to tradition ough
only rumors about my taste and
my satisfaction
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
fast forward to three hundred awkward pizza parties later
if they got pepperoni I will surmise that you'll probably enjoy
you dream of pineapple before it ruined the pizza culture
you search for every excuse to order something different

[Chorus]
was it wrong to put pineapple on the dough
was it wrong to ignore the pizza code ough
come on now don't be a fool
in your dreams as you devour ough
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
should pine
be on a pizza ough
should pine
belong on a

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
the pineapple on
at least I had the decency
to stick to tradition ough
only rumors about my taste and
my satisfaction
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come running oughough
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Outro]
disgrace to the pizza
was it over then and is it over now oughoughoughough
pizza culture baby oughoughoughough
should pineapple belong ough
was it over then and
is it
over now oughoughoughoughoughoughoughoughough
