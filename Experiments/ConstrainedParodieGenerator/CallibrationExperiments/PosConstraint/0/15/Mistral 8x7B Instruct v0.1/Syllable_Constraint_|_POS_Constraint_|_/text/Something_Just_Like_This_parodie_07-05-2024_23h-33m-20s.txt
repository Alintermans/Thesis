[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the trends
pineapple on pizza
it's a debate that desc
ends into a mess
of heated arguments
but I don't see the need for it to represent

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said won't you try it
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some controversial mix
just something simple
a classic dish to
turn to when I crave something
delicious and true blue
I want something just like that

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doodoos and doodas and
doodoos and doodas
doodoos and doodas and
oh I want something just like that
doodoos and doodas and
doodoos and doodas
doodoos and doodas and
oh I want something just like that
I want something just like that

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the trends
ham and pineapple's nice
but not on my pizza
and superman prefers
a slice without the sin
but I'm not the kind of person that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
they said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk I
'm not looking for a pizza with
some controversial mix just
something simple a
classic dish to turn
to when I crave something de
licious and true blue got

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like that
I want something just like that

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like that
doodoos and doodas and
doodoos and doodas
doodoos and doodas and
oh I want something just like that
doodoos and doodas and
doodoos and doodas
doodoos and do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some controversial mix
just something simple
a classic dish to
turn to when I crave something
delicious and true blue
I want something just like that

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like that
oh I want something just like that
oh I want something just like that
