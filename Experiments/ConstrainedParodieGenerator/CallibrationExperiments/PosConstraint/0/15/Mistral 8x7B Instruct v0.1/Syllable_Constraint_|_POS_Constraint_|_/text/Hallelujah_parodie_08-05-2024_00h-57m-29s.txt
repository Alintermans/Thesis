[Verse 1]
now I've heard there's a culinary
abomination that's a pity
pineapple on a pizza pie yeah you know it
it clashes with the cheese and sauce
the sweet and savory collide
the taste buds cringe at the monstrosity inc

[Chorus]
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no

[Verse 2]
you thought it seemed like fun to try it
but one bite made you regret it
the flavors fought and left you high and dry ya
the tangy fruit and tomato
created quite the taste faux paso
and now you're stuck with this abomination

[Chorus]
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no

[Verse 3]
they say it's just personal taste
but don't you dare deface a
pizza pie with fruit it's just a waste of time
the toppings should complement each other
not create a flavor warfare
a savory dish should never taste like crime

[Chorus]
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no

[Verse 4]
I gave it chance I must confess
I took a bite but then I said no
I can't abide this savory mess you
created on this pizza pie
with nothing left to say but no
I'll turn away from this abomination

[Chorus]
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no

[Outro]
no no pineapple pizza no

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I've seen this mess upon the floor
I used to love pizza before I knew you
and I've had my share of pineapple too
but never on a pizza pie
it's just a culinary faux pas no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
that pineapple on pizza was
a good idea but now you never show
the proper respect to pizza that
a culinary masterpiece
should always be a savory delight no no

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from love
is how to appreciate a savory
dish that's never been defiled by pine
and it's not a taste that you savor
it's a culinary faux pas no no no oh
