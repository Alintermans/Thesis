[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
all my sins need holy water washing over me like wine
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's coming home with pineapple on pizza
burnt crust and marinara sauce
on his breath's anchovies and regret
she just wants to spit it out and eject ribly
it's a food fight he's on the defense like a vet
she's armed with pepperoni and she won
it's a game of chess he's on the defense like a checkmate
she's got pineapple in hand ready to disconnect his tastebud
from his brain like a circuit
she's made up her mind that pineapple on pizza is obsc
ene and she won't stand for it no more no way
so she's been on the web lately researching recipes
that don't include pineapple
she says maybe she'll make a pizza with mushrooms and
pepperoni to spite her man and his pineapple addiction
but she's using him to try to prove a point
hi suzanne but I shoulda said bye suz

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
all my sins need holy water washing over me like wine
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a one bite wonder
it was gone by sunrise but now she wants more and
he can't understand why she insists on
topping the pizza with pineapple when it
doesn't belong there like a square peg in a round hole
now how is he supposed to tell this girl that pineap
ple is not allowed on his pizza anymore it's hard
to find the words he's at a loss for words so he reverts to the kitchen
like a hole in the wall diner where he can cook up something better
where he can make a pizza without the
pineapple and not have to explain himself to her
he just feels like the person he's turning into is irrede
emable he preyed on her love for pineapple
and now that he's got her he doesn't want
her anymore he took advantage
of her love for pineapple and used it to his
advantage but now he regrets it and
wishes he could take it
back but it's too late the damage is done and
he can't unsay the words he said about pineapple on
top

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
all my sins need holy water washing over me like wine
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's river my name
my name
call
me river
we'll let the river run
river run river run river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the instigator never the
defender of pineapple on pizza
fuck can I say if pineapple was a highway and de
fending it was a crime I'd be swerving in five lane
s going fast as I can trying to
get away from the pineap
ple but I can't escape it's always
there lurking in the shadows waiting to ruin
my pizza experience like a bad dream
call me the pineapple hater the
pizza purist the pineapple elimin
ator always on the lookout for pineap

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
all my sins need holy water washing over me like wine
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
's gonna cause is pain the truth and
my lies now are falling like the rain so let the
river run the river
