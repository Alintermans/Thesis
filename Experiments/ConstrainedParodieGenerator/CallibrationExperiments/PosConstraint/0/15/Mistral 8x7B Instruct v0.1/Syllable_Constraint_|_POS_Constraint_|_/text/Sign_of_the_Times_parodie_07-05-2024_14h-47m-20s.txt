[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a culinary crime
don't you think it's gross inside
you can't cover up the taste with extra cheese
it's just wrong on a pizza
it's a crime against taste bud

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
get served at times like these
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
get served at times like these

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and listen to
my words of advice we gotta
get away from this dish we just
stop with the pineapple it's not nice we
gotta get away from this mess
we gotta get away from this

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and try something
new like pepperoni or
sausage or mushrooms instead
remember you won't regret it when
you taste the difference so
far away from pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
get served at times like these
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
get served at times like these

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and listen to
my words of advice we gotta
get away from this dish we just
stop with the pineapple it's not nice wegott
a get away from this mess we
gotta get away from this mess

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
get served at times like these
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
get served at times like these

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
we should open up
before it's all too much
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my plealet
's get away we got to
get away we got to get away we got to
get away we got to get away we got to
get away we got to get aw
ay we got to get away we
got to get away we got to
