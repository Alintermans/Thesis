[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
my taste buds scream in horror
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just should not be

[Verse 1]
let me ponder for a while and find a clever line
to write a little ditty
to tell you what to doo do
do you taste my recipes
or ignore my culinary
when I ask you try a slice or
will you still refuse to che
I knew when I presented you with this treat so
you'd give it just one bite or two or three
but you rejected all my pleas for you to see its gleeupon tasting
you just shrugged and said it's not
for me don't say it isn
you clearly weren't aware that you made me nauseous
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza pie I'm feeling
happier without it on my plate for sure now wish
I could explain it better but it just should not be on there oh
it's such a culinary

[Verse 2]
you top it once again with pineap
es scattered all around the crusty
cheese you scare me to the core but I'm wasting
my breath because you only follow your
pizza preferences and
you don't care about my views
I don't relate to you at
all I don't relate to

[Verse 3]
and I don't put pineapple on my pizza posts on
line never told anyone anything
good about it cause that shit's embarrassing you
were my everything and all that you did was
make me lose my appetite so don't
waste the time I don't have and don
try to make me feel bad I could talk about every time
that you tried it on a slice but I'd have an empty
line because you never did you never paid attention
to my opinions or my taste so I shut

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my dishes your own
just fuckin' leave me alone already
ah
goddam
ah
fuck you
fuck you
