[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I spit it out in the trash with disgust
you just laughed and said it's a delicacy

[Verse 2]
oh my sweet disappointment and your wild tastebud
we argued for hours in the kitchen like
hammer and nail going back and forth in denail
but I can't believe it after all these

[Pre-Chorus]
trials and tribulations
of pineapple on pizza
I might be okay but I'm not satisfied at
all oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on that slice of bread
I nearly cried at the sight of it insteadwind in my hair
I was there I remember
it all too well oh oh oh oh

[Verse 3]
recipe book on the countertop you flipping pages
I saw the pineapple and I cringed with rage inside I was se
ething you said it's a classic combination of sweet and
savory but I knew it was a sinful abom
ination and I couldn't bear to look at it anymore
tossed it in the bin and said never again will
I subject myself to such a culinary crime
and I thought to myself how could anyone think this is
good I just don't understand
running far away from It I was there I
remember it all too well
and you laughed at me and said I was overreacting
but I knew I was right and I would never back down

[Pre-Chorus]
trials and tribulations
of pineapple on pizza oh
I might be okay but I'm not fully
satisfied at all oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on that triangle of
doom I looked away and said never again will I partake
in this culinary
disaster oh oh oh oh oh
and there it was again when nobody was looking
I tried it once more just to be sure it was as bad as
I remembered it was
even worse oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Bridge]
well maybe we got carried away with
too many toppings maybe
I asked for too much but this thing was a
masterpiece until
you added pineapple
running scared I was there I still
remember it all too well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
and you called me up again just to prove me wrong oh oh oh
it was a mistake oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too well

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time I see pineapple on
pizza it makes me want to scream and shout oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
and the memories of that
fateful night come rushing back to me oh oh
I remember it all too well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
the taste of pineapple on pizza
will never be forgotten oh oh oh
I remember it
all too well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too well oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too well oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 5]
I was never a fan of pineapple on a
pizza but you convinced me to give it a try and I regret it
to this very day oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too well oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too well oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too well oh oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too
well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on that slice of
hell I looked away and said never again will I
partake in this culin
ary disaster oh oh oh
and there it was again when
nobody was looking
I tried it once more just
to be sure it was as
bad as I remembered
it was even worse oh oh oh

[Verse 6]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it oh oh oh
I'd like to forget the taste of pineapple
on pizza but it still lingers in the
back of my mind oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too well oh
I remember it all too well oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too
well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well

[Outro]

I remember it all too well oh oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too well oh oh
I remember it all too well oh
I remember it all too well oh
I remember it all too well oh oh oh
I remember it all too well oh oh
I remember it all too well oh
