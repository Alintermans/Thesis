[Verse 1]
grab some dough, and call
your friends it's just not worth the fall
they're grossly wrong and misled ousing pine
on pizza pie it's such a crime

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the taste obscured it's quite obscene
here we are now please interven
it tastes absurd and utterly
unappetizingly obscene
a pineapple a sweet mistake
on pizza pie it does not make

[Post-Chorus]
yuck yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
their tastebuds duller than
the ones who've never tasted
real pizza bliss again and again
and always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the taste obscured it's quite obscene
here we are now please interven
it tastes absurd and utterly
unappetizingly obscene
a pineapple a sweet mistake
on pizza pie it does not make

[Post-Chorus]
yuck yeah yeah

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I tried
that slice with pineapple inside
it left a mark I cannot hide
oh well whatever never mind

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the taste obscured it's quite obscene
here we are now please interven
it tastes absurd and utterly
unappetizingly obscene
a pineapple a sweet mistake
on pizza pie it does not make

[Outro]
a travesty a travesty
a travesty a travesty
a travesty a travesty
a travesty a travesty
a travesty
