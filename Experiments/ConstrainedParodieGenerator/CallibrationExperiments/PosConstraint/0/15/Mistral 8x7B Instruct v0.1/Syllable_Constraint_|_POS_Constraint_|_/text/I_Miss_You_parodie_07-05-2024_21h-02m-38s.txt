[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise It, I

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
that abomination at
the dinner table on a pizza base
a monstrosity lurking
in the shadows of the fe
we can't abide if we don't want it
where you can never find me
and we'll ban halloween on pizza
and in the night we'll wish it goneaway
we'll wish it goneaway

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where did it come from does it have
a right to claim a place on bread tonight
I need protection from this curse
this bitter poison
spreading on like a disease every time
and as I see it gather
the disgust on all the slic
catching people and ruining their
taste buds with its deceptionist
will you take it off before
it ruins everything tonight or am
I already too

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
let it rot away don't waste your time on
pineapple tonight on
I despise it I desp
let it rot away don't waste your time on
pineapple tonight on
I despise it I desp

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
let it rot away don't waste your time on
pineapple tonight on
I despise it I desp
let it rot away don't waste your time on
pineapple tonight on
I despise it I desp
let it rot away don't waste your time on
pineapple tonight on
I despise it I desp
let it rot away don't waste your time on
pineapple tonight on
I despise it I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
