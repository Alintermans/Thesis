[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go ical error
pineapple should not be thereorrow
I should've picked it off sooner
if the critics ever did speak
it's a culinary
faux pas that's quite bleaksweet ham and pine
is a combo divine
we were raised on pepperoniand sa
usage is the normproponents
of pineapple claim it's primebut
I find it hard to abideby
this sweet fruit on my slicei
t was raised on traditionbut
I must take a stand and

[Pre-Chorus]
a pity
pity pity

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pieI'll eat like a king without its
tartness to defileI'll tell you my taste and you
can take it in strideoffer
me a better sliceplease do not
insist on this
keep pineapple off my pizza pieI'll eat like a
king without its tartness to defileI'll tell you
my taste and you can take it
in strideoffer me a better slice

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the old school
my pizza's the jewel
to keep the aficionados
on my side they insist on
adding sweetness to the piebut that
juxtapositioni find quite
grating on my tonguewhat
you got on that sliceany
thing but pineapple will suffice
this is picky eatingworkbut
I must take a stand

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pieI'll eat like a king without its
tartness to defileI'll tell you my taste and you
can take it in strideoffer
me a better sliceplease do not
insist on this
keep pineapple off my pizza pieI'll eat like a
king without its tartness to defileI'll tell you
my taste and you can take it
in strideoffer me a better slice

[Bridge]
no compromiseswhen it comes to this debate
there is no sweeter simplicity than our classic
recipein the madness of this culinary
fight only then do I find my appetite is right

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh pity
pity pity

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pieI'll eat like a king without its
tartness to defileI'll tell you my taste and you
can take it in strideoffer
me a better sliceplease do not
insist on this
keep pineapple off my pizza pieI'll eat like a
king without its tartness to defileI'll tell you
my taste and you can take it
in strideoffer me a better slice
