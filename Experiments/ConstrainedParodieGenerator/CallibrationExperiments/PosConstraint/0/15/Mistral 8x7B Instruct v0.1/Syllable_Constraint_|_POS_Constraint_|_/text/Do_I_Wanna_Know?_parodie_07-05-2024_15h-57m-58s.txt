[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple on your
slice a turnoff that just can't slide off your tongue quite right
does it clash with ham like red and purple
color schemes that make your stomach
churn in disgust at this monstrosity
have you no shame that you can't see the error of
your ways in putting pineapple
on pizza should be
a crime it's like a bad dream I can't escape from my mind
I've tried every way to forget it but it

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want it to go away this feeling of
despair when I see pineapple on a pizza slice
do I want it to stay this feeling of disgust
at this culinary sin that should be erased from

[Chorus]
staying away from
that sweet and savory mon
strosity have
you ever thought
about keeping
pineapple far from
your pizza never thought it
through now I know it
should never be on

[Verse 2]
so do you have the nerve
to put pineapple on a pizza and
claim it's good when it's clearly vile and obscene
stop and think before you take a bite and ruin your meal
it's not worth the regret that comes after you swallow that first
bite of pineapple on pizza it's like a nightmare
that won't go away no matter how hard you

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want it to go away this feeling of
despair when I see pineapple on a pizza slice
do I want it to stay this feeling of disgust
at this culinary sin that should be erased from

[Chorus]
try to forget it the taste of pineap
ple on pizza stays with you
long after you've eaten it
have you ever thought about what you
put on your pizza never thought it through
now I know it should never be
on pizza never thought it
through now I know it
should never be on

[Outro]
do I want it to go away this feeling of
despair when I see pineapple on a pizza slice
do I want it to stay this feeling of disgust
at this culinary sin that should be erased from
my memory do I want pineapple on pizza
never again do you want me eating pineapple
on pizza never again do you want me eating pine
