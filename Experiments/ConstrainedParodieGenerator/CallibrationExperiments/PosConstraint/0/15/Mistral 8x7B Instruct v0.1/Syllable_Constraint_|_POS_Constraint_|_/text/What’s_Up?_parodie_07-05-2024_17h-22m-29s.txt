[Verse 1]
two slices tried and my ver
dict is clear trying to shirk icianally
from that pineapple pie
but it's just not the same without some ham
forget about that sweet and sour combo man it
never did sit right with

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I take a bite in
disguise to get it all out my disdain
and I i am feeling a little weirded out
and so I rise in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep whiff and I feel alive
and I shout from the top of my lungs
what's that taste on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's that taste on in
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's that taste on in

[Bridge]
ooh o
oh
ooh uh u
oh o
oh
ooh uh u

[Verse 2]
and I fight
oh my god do I fight
I fight all the time
in this institution
and I bite
oh my god do I bite
I bite every single time
for retribution

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I take a bite in
disguise to get it all out my disdain
and I i am feeling a little weirded out
and so I rise in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep whiff and I feel alive
and I shout from the top of my lungs
what's that taste on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's that taste on
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's that taste on in
and I say hey hey hey
rise in the morning and step outside
take a deep
and I shout from the top of my lungs
what's that taste
and I say hey hey hey yeah yeah
rise in the morning and
step outside take a deep and I shout
what's that taste on par
and I say hey hey hey yeah yeah yeah
rise in the
step outside take a deep and shout

[Bridge]
ooh o
oh
ooh uh u

[Outro]
two slices tried and my ver
dict is clear trying to shirk icianally
from that pineapple pie hell
