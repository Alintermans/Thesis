[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something' bout
that slice of pizza with pineapple
on top or not izz
it a sin to put it on your dish

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm appalled
at the thought of pineapple on a pizza
for real
it's a crime that it could ever be

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something man
are you tired of ruining pizza
with fruit on top or
are you just a fan of bad taste too much

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm appalled
at the thought of pineapple on a pizza
for real
it's a crime that it could ever be

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm over the deep end seeing pine on
my pizza pie gone wrong
toss it out the window where they can't see
we're far from the pineapple

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pitiful pile of
pizza with pineapple yuckiness
in the pitiful tower
we're far from the pineapple

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh no ah ah
oh no ah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm over the deep end seeing pine on
my pizza pie gone wrong
toss it out the window where they can't see
we're far from the pineapple

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pitiful pile
in the pizza with pineapple hell
in the pitiful pile
we're far from the pineapple
