[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love my pie
topped with cheese up in the sky now
in the morning I take a slice too
discovering pineapple

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to savor each
bite of pepperonI's rich speech now
tastebuds cry for justice
pineapple has no place on my pizza
one bite and I feel the dece
of this sweet and savory
discrepancy my castles crumble like
crushed tomato on doughy anxiety

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear alarm bells ringing loud and clear
ham and pineapple is a culprit
be my advocate for tasty
pizza pies without the ridiculous
for some reason I can't explain
once I tasted perfection
there was never room for
pineapple on my pizza plate

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a radical and wild
idea to put pineapple
on pizza but it's not worth the while
conspiracy cooked up by some villain
revolutionaries wait
for my apology for this
monstrosity but I won't back down from
pizza purity and tradition

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear alarm bells ringing loud and clear
ham and pineapple is a culprit
be my advocate for tasty
pizza pies without the ridiculous
for some reason I can't explain
I know connoisseurs won'
t call pineapple sup
reme but that was before I knew

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no no no no no
pineapple on pizza
oh no no no no no
pineapple on pizza

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
hear alarm bells ringing
oh no no no no no no no no
pineapple on pizza
oh no no no no no no no no
pizza purity is
what I'm fighting for and I won
t back down from this war
against pineapple on pizza plates no
matter what anyone
has to say about it anymore
pizza purity is
what I'm fighting for and I won't back
down from this war against
pineapple on pizza plates no

[Outro]
mmm no no no
pizza purists
unite
