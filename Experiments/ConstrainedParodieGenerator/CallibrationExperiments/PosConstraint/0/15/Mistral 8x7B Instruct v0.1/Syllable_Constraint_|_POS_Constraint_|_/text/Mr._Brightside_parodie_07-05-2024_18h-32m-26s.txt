[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottles in hand looking so divine start
it started out with a slice now my stomach is in a
wad can't believe it pineapple on pizza
now I'm full of regret and my tastebuds are
offended it's culinary warfare and it
was only a slice but now I can't partake
in this monstrosity

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savoring each bite
it tastes so right tonight
let me be
for I cannot bear to take a bite of
this disasterpiece

[Chorus]
indigestion filling up my soul no
swimming through a food coma
gagging at the thought alone
but it's just the price I pay
legacy is calling me
closed up my disappointed
eyes for I am pine

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine must
ard bottles discarded now my stomach is in
a bind can't believe it pineapple on pizza was
only a crime but now I can't partake in
this monstrosity can't believe I ever
thought it was okay to put fruit on my pizza
now it's ruined forever and I can't take
it back anymore it

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savoring each bite
it tastes so right tonight
let me be
for I cannot bear to take a bite
of this disaster

[Chorus]
indigestion filling up my soul no
swimming through a food coma
gagging at the thought alone
but it's just the price I pay
legacy is calling me
closed up my disappointed
eyes for I am pine

[Guitar Solo]


[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never
