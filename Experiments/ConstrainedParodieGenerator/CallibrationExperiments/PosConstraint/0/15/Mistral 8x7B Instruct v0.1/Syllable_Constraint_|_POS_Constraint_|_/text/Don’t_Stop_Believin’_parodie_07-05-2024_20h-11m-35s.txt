[Verse 1]
just a small town slicefar from a pineapple
a classic pie with cheese and pepperoni
there's grease and spice but never any pineapple
it's just not nice to mess with tradition see

[Verse 2]
a bite so warm and savory
the taste of dough and tangy tom
for a moment all your worries
go away with every bite you

[Pre-Chorus]
critics gather
hating on our pizza
their arguments lacking reason
streetlights shine on
crusts full of emotion tucked in
pizza lovers never leave

[Verse 3]
bakers rise before the dawn
makin' dough roll out and ya
hand toss pies with love and care displayed
only one slice

[Verse 4]
some prefer pineapple
that's fine it's no big dealio
but true aficionados
know it's all about the cheese and meat

[Pre-Chorus]
critics gather
hating on our pizza
their arguments lacking reason
streetlights shine on
crusts full of emotion tucked in
pizza lovers never leave

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin
hold on to that pizza
streetlights shine on
don't stop believin
hold on
streetlights shine on
don't stop believin
hold on to that pizza
streetlights shine on
