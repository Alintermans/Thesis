[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a crime having pineapple
on a pie that's meant for cheese and
pepperoni and sausage too
that's the way it's always been done hallelu

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness to the
savory flavors of the pie
but to me it's just a travesty having
pineapple up in the sky it
just don't make no sense hallelu
or in other words it's just not right hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 3]
you argue that it's a matter
of personal taste and style but
to me it's just a pizza crime having to
explain why pineapple don't belong
it's like putting ketchup on a
hot dog it's just not the way hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 4]
I don't know who started this
pineapple on pizza trend but they
ought to be ashamed hallelujah hallel
I'll stick to my pepperoni
and mushrooms and onions and pe
pperoncini hallelujah hallelu

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
pineapple on pizza it's just

[Additional Lyrics]
I know you think you're being
different and unique but news
flash it's been done before and it's just not cool
and remember when we used to order
pizza and it was perfect just
the way it was hallelujah hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a pizza topping
that you love more than I do but
putting pineapple on a pie is just not
something I can get behind hallel
and it's not a cry that you hear
at the pizzeria it's just a broken ha

[Additional Lyrics]
I know you think you're a re
bel but to me it's just a sin
putting pineapple on a pizza it's just
not something that I can win hallelu
so keep your pineapple on your sal
ad and leave my pizza alone hallelujah
