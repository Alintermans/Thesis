[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' while we're meetin' some people say
it's a topping that's quite neat but I don
t think it's somethin' that I'd be
eatin' on a pie that's meant to be sav
ory not sweet that's just how I feel about it don
t you agree that it's just not
right and it doesn't
belong on a pizza that's just how I see it don't you
know it's just not for me that's just how it goes ver

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want pineapple on my pizza no way
do I think it's a good idea nope not today
do I want my pizza to taste like hawaii
no thanks I'll stick to the classics don't you know the

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
pizza that I love with to
ppings that I know
and love like pe
pperoni and
sausage and mushrooms
too and olives and onions
and maybe some ba
con too but no pine

[Verse 2]
so have you heard about
the pineapple pizza debate it's a
topic that's quite heated some say it's great but
I say it's not right for me it's just not my cup of tea
I like my pizza the old fashioned way with toppings that don
t make it taste like fruit that's just how I feel about
it and I know I'm not alone in this belief

[Pre-Chorus]
do I want pineapple on my pizza no way
do I think it's a good idea nope not today
do I want my pizza to taste like hawaii
no thanks I'll stick to the classics don't you know the

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the pizza that I love
with toppings that I know and
love like pepperoni and
sausage and mushrooms too and olives
and onions and maybe some bacon too
but no pineapple no way no
pineapple on my pizza
ever that's just how
it's gotta be for

[Outro]
do I want pineapple on my pizza no way
do I think it's a good idea nope not today
do I want my pizza to taste like hawaii
no thanks I'll stick to the classics don't you know the
way that it should be is with toppings that are meaty
and cheesy and not too sweet that's just how I feel don
t you agree that's just how it should be that's just how it
