[Intro]
come on pizza lovers we wanna say no to

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
top of your pie it's such a
mistake don't you know it's wrong like a crime
just hold out your hand and listen
nothing to say
when the toppings don't align
pineapple doesn't belong
and we can't unsee it oh no oh no

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
of the pizza deliver
why are you ordering something so wrong
what kind of toppings are you
thinking of ring
the doorbell and nobody's com
ing to your rescue your taste
buds are suffering oh oh oh what a shame

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go back to the menu get a new plan
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
try something else for a change don't be
so stubborn I don't wanna talk about who's to

[Outro]
pin
apple on
top of your pie it's such a mistake
you know it's not the same
