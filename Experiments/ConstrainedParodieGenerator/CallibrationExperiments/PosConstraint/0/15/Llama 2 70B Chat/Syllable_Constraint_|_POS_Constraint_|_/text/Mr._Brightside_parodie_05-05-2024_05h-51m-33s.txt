comin' out of my kitchen and I've been cookin' just
gotta gotta be hot because I want it all
it started out with a pineapple how did it end up

only a pineapple now I'm fallin' asleep
and she's callin' a doctor while he's havin' a

bed and my stomach is

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's touchin' my tongue now
he takes off my hunger
let me go
because I just can't taste it it's kill
in' me and takin

[Chorus]
pineapple turnin' pizza into a
disaster swimmin' through che
esy toppings chokin' on
your lies but it's just the price
I pay destiny is call
in' me open up my hun
gry eyes because I
