[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the blasphemy against the fine
people's tastebuds disapproval
I should've rejected it way
if the flavors ever did speak
pineapple's the last thing
I want on my pie on a weekend
a fresh disaster each
time we try to combine is getting
bleaker and bleaker every
sunday with pineapple on top this
my tastebuds offers no absol
utes she tells me worship
in the kitchen the only way
to eat pizza is with

[Pre-Chorus]
a emen
amen emen

[Chorus]
take my pizza
I'll devour it like a dog at the shrine of
your culinary lies I'll tell you my cravings
and you can sharpen your bla
des offer me that flavorless death
oh good pizza
give me your life take my pizza I'll devour
it like a dog at the shrine of your culiary
lies I'll tell you my cravings
and you can sharpen your blade offer

[Verse 2]
if I'm a fan of the good slices
my pizza's the sunlight
to keep the flavor on my side
it demands a sacrifice
drain the whole bottle get somethin
spicy somethin meaty for
the main course that's a fine look
in pizza what you got in
the kitchen we've a lot of star
ving tastebuds that looks tasty
that looks plenty this

[Chorus]
take my pizza
I'll devour it like a dog at the shrine of
your culinary lies I'll tell you my cravings
and you can sharpen your bla
des offer me that flavorless death
oh good pizza
give me your life take my pizza I'll devour
it like a dog at the shrine of your culiary
lies I'll tell you my cravings
and you can sharpen your blade offer

[Bridge]
no pineapples or pepperoni when the me
al begins there is no sweeter taste than our gentle
craving in the madness and soil of that sad cul
inary scene only then I am human only

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen emen

[Chorus]
take my pizza
I'll devour it like a dog at the shrine of
your culinary lies I'll tell you my cravings
and you can sharpen your bla
des offer me that flavorless death
oh good pizza
give me your life take my pizza I'll devour
it like a dog at the shrine of your culiary
lies I'll tell you my cravings
and you can sharpen your blade offer
