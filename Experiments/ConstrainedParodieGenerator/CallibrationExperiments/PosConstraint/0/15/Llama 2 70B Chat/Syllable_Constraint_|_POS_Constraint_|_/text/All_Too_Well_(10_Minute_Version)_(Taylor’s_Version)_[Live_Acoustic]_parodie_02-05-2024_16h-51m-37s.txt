[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong it was
like a crime scene without a care but something

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory gaze autumn
leaves falling down like anchovies in disgra
order and I can picture it after all these
days and I can picture it after all these

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pepperonI's not the
and I might be okay but my taste buds are not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost burned the crust because you were looking over at
cheese in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza on the counter your stomach was
turning grumpy you used to be a little kid with a big appet
ite and your mom's telling stories bout you and your broccoli
you told me bout your cravings thinking your future was
me and you were tossing me the slice keys fuck the pineapple
lovers association and I was thinking
on the drive down any time now he's gonna say it
s love you never called it what it was til we were dead
and gone and buried check the pul
se and come back swearing it's the same dam
thing after three months in the
grave and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for
you but all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an
oath sacred prayer and we
d swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paper here
cause I remember it all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you doublecross my taste
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fin
e and that made me want to
die the idea you had of me who was
she a neverneedy everlovely jewel whose shine reflects on
you not weeping in a party bath
room some pizza asking me what happened
you that's what happened
you you who charmed my tastebuds with self eff
acing jokes sipping coffee like you're on a late
night show but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you
to come and he said it's supposed to be fun turning flav

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my toppings and I walk home al
one but you keep my old favorite from that first
week cause it reminds you of innocence and it makes
me you can't get rid of
it cause you remember it all too

[Chorus]
cause there we are again when I loved you
so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well wind in my hair you were
there you remember it
all down the stairs you were
there you remember it
all it was rare I was
there I remember it all too

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punchline goes
I'll get older but your pizza stays my age
from when your hawaiian shirt broke my heart
and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half
my weight and did the pineapple bru
ise paint you blue just between us did the love af
fair maim you too cause in this
city's barren cold I still remember
the first slice of pepperoni
and how it glistened as it fell

[Outro]
I remember it all too well just between us did the
love affair maim you all too well just between us do
you remember it all too well just between us I remember
it all too well wind in my hair I was
there down the stairs I was there sacred
prayer I was there it was rare you too
well wind in my hair I was there down the sta
irs I was there sacred prayer I was there
it was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was there
down the stairs I was there sacred
prayer I was there it was rare you remem
ber it all too well wind in my hair
I was there down the stairs I was there
sacred prayer I was there it was
rare you remember it all too well what
ever happened to the pizza that
we used to share whatever happened
to the pizza that we used to share where did

[Spoken Outro]
