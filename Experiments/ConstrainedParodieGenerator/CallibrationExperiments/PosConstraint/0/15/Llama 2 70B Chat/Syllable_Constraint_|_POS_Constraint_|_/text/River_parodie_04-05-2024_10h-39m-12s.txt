[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]

pineapple on pizza is
a sinful deed been a fake been a phony perfectionist
all my sins need pineapple free water feel it washing
over me well little one I
don't want to admit to something if all it
s gonna cause is pain

back like a jetpack she s kept track of all his pizza
orders and guess who just happens to be movin on to the next slice
