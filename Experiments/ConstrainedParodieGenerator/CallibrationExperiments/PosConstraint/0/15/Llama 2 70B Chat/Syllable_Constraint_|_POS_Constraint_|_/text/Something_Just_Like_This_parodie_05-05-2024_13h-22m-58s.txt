[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been thinking bout pizza
the toppings and the che
pepperoni and sa
utes and mushrooms too
but one thing that don
t belong on a pie
is pineapple in my view so clearly I don't

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
see myself eating that stuff oh
where d'you wanna go with
your pizza toppings how much you
wanna risk putting something
so wrong on a pie
I'm not looking for
some exotic fruit on top
some flavor that just don
t belong there just something

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
a classic margher
ita pepperoni
and mushroom delight oh I want
something just like this do
o doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo doo do

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading reviews of
pizza joints and their men
us the options they pres
ent the choices they make
but one thing that's always
a mistake pineapple
on a pizza it's just not right don't you

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
see where d'you wanna go with your
pizza toppings how much
you wanna risk putting something
so wrong on a pie I'm not
looking for some ex
otic fruit on top
some flavor that just don't
belong there just something

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
a classic margherita

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo do
o doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for some body
with some exotic fruit on
top some flavor that
just don't belong
there just something I can turn
to something I can miss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
