[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pizza that I adore
with toppings that I can't ignore che
like pepperoni and sa
usage and mushrooms galore
but one thing that I can't implore is go
pineapple on my pie don
t ruin it with your sweetness and
juiciness that's just not right no no no
we can't have hawai

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab
hor it I abhor it

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the pizza that I love
the one with the toppings from above an
d not the one with the fruit that
comes from a tree it
s not a pizza it's a salad don't
you see don't you see don
t put pineapple on a
pizza it's not the way to be free
free from the chains of wrong toppings
like pineapple it just doesn
t belong it doesn't belong no no
no don't do it

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's al
ready the voice inside
my head I abhor it
I abhor it I abhor it I abhor
it I abhor it don
t waste your time on it

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's al
ready the voice inside
my head I abhor it
I abhor it I abhor it I abhor
it I abhor it don
t waste your time on it
don't waste your time on it it's already
the voice inside my head
I abhor it I ab
hor it I abhor it I abhor it don
t waste your time on it
it's already the voice

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor it I ab
hor it I abhor it
I abhor it I ab
hor it I abhor it
