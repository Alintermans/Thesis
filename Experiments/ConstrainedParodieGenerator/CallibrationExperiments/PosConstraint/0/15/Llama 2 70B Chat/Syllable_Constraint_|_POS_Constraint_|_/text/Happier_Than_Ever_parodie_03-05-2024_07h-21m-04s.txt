[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain it clear
it doesn't belong there

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to collect my thought before I
start to rant about this ab
horrent topping that you see
on a beautiful pie that
should be savory not sweet oh
why must you ruin it with that
pineapple it's just not right
you say it's a taste of hawaii I say it
makes my stomach turn and twist icked off
I knew when I saw it on the menu I had to speak my mind you
wouldn't understand the hate
you'd do the opposite of
what you said you'd do and spill it all over the place
and I'd end up feeling quite ir

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain it clear it doesn't here
belong there wish I could explain it better I wish it weren
t true mm mm when I'm e

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask me to meet
at the pizza joint down the street I
hang up the phone and delete your number it
s just too much for me to bear the thought
of pineapple on a pie
it s not related to me
I don't relate to you no
cause you only listen to

[Verse 3]
your stomach and not my pleas I don't talk shit about
you on the internet never told a
single soul how you ruined pizza for me cause
that's embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me fuckin
sad so don't waste the time I don
t have and don't try to make me feel bad I could talk ab
out every time that you showed up on time but that
would be a lie cause you never did you never paid a
mind to my taste buds or my friends so I shut

[Outro]
em all out for you cause I
was a kid you ruined everything
good always said you were mis
understood made all my moments your own
just
fuckin
le
ve me
alone
