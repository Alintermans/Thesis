[Intro]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pie to

[Verse 1]
tropical flav
gonna make me throw up in
cannot abide the sweetness inside of me
why would you wanna deceive me
pineapple does
not belong on a pie like me
in this world of savory
can't you see the error of your ways

[Chorus]
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was with cheese and
sausage only please don

[Verse 2]
expectations
met with disappointment and
sweat dripping from my brow in distressment
pineapple does not belong
mixes the flav
and creates a mess in my mouth
I cannot enjoy my me
it's not the same as it was before when it

[Chorus]
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was with cheese and
sausage only please don

[Bridge]
stay away from pineapple on my pie
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
stay away from pineapple on my pie
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

[Outro]
don
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was with pizza
