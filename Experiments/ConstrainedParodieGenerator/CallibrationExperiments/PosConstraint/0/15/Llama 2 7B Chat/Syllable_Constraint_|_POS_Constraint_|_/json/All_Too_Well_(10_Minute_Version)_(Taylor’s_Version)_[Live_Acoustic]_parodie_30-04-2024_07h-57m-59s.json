your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nI love you guys so much [/INST]\nParody:\n[Verse 1]\npineapple on a pizza should be a crime\nhow could you even consider such a thing\nit's like putting ketchup on a hot dog in\ntime it wastes away is time we can never\n\n[Verse 2]\nthe flavors don't match and the texture's all wrong\nit's like someone took a slice of paradise\nripped it right out from under our noses and\nthrew it on a plate with a topping that just\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand we can't help but feel\na sense of disbelief and\nbetrayal at the sheer audacity of it\npineapple\n\n[Chorus]\nbecause pineapple on a pizza is like\na best friend who's always there for you but never really gets\nyou back and it's like trying\nto find the perfect song on the\n\n[Verse 3]\nthe radio when you're driving home from a long day at\nwork and you just want to let loose and sing at the top of your lungs but\nno matter how hard you try that one song always seems to be\njust out of reach and it's like pineapple on apizz\nit's just not meant to be and we can't help but wonder what\nother toppings could have made it perfect instead\nand we're left with this bitter taste in our mouths and\nwe can't help but wonder why they even tried in the\nfirst place because pineapple on\na pizza is like a relationship that\njust never quite works out and\nwe're left picking up the pieces and trying to make sense\nof it all and it's just not worth the risk because let\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nwe know that pineapple on\na pizza is a crime against\nhumanity and nature and we can\nhardly believe that anyone\n\n[Chorus]\nwould ever dare to commit such a foul and we\ncan only hope that the trend will soon fade away and be cons\nremembered as a dark\nage in the history of cul\nine and pizza and we can finally move on to\ngreener pastures and better toppings and never have to\nsuffer through another\npineapple pizza again because\n\n[Bridge]\nit's like they say in the business world don\nalways look before you le\nand when it comes to toppings on a pie\nalways stick to the\nclassics and never take\nchances because you never know\nwhat you might find yourself in for and we can't help but feel\na sense of unease every time we see someone taking\na bite of that sweet and spicy combination\nbecause it's just not right and we\n\n[Verse 4]\ncan't help but wonder what other toppings could have\nmade that pizza perfect instead and we\nare left with this sour taste in our mouths and a feeling of dis\nbelief that maybe they just\nweren't meant to be in the pizza game at\nall and maybe they should have stuck to what they know and love and not taken\nchances with something as sacred as\na pizza topping because pineapple\non a pizza is\nlike a relationship that just never quite\nworks out and we're left picking up the pieces and\ntrying to make sense of it all and it's just not worth the risk and\nwe can't help but wonder why they even tried in the\n\n[Verse 5]\nfirst place because pineapple on a pizza is\nlike a song that just never quite fits the melody and we're left with\nthis feeling of disappointment and disbelief and\nwe can't help but think of all the other to\nppings that could have made it perfect instead and we\nare left with this bitter taste in our mouths and a\nsense of unease every\ntime we see someone taking aslice\n\n[Chorus]\nbecause pineapple on a pizza is\nlike a relationship that just never quite works out\nand we're left picking up\nthe pieces and trying to make\nsense of it all and it's just\nnot worth the risk and we\ncan't help but wonder\nwhy they even tried in\nthe first place because it\njust doesn't belong on a pie\n\n[Verse 6]\nwe know that pineapple on a pizza is a crime against\nhumanity and nature and we can't\nhardly believe that anyone would dare\nto commit such a foul and we can only\nhope that the trend will soon fade away\nand be remembered as a dark age in the his\ntory of culinary\nand pizza and we can finally move\non to greener pastures and bet\nter toppings and never have to\n\n[Outro]\nsuffer through another pineapple pizza again be\ncause it's just not worth the risk and we can't help but\nwonder why they even tried in the first place because it just doesn\ndoesn't belong on a pie and we're left\nwith this bitter taste in our mouth\nand a sense of unease every\ntime we see someone taking a bite of that\nsweet and spicy combination because\nit's just not right and we can't help\nbut feel a sense of disbelief and\nunbelief that maybe they just\nweren't meant to be in the pizza game\nat all and maybe they should have stuck\nto what they know and love and not tak\nchances with something as sacred\nas a pizza topping because pineapp\non a pizza is like a rela\ntionship that just never quite works out\nand we're left picking up the pieces andtry\n\n[Spoken
