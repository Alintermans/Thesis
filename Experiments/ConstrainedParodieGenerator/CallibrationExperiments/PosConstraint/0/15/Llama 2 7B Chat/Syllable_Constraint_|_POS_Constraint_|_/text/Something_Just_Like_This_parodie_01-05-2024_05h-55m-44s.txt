[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I had a pineapple on
my pizza and it didn
didn't quite go as planned
the cheese started to slide
and the juice se
spilled all over my hands
I'm not looking for a topping that's sour and sweet

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go now
how much you want to eat
I'm not finding anything that
tastes quite like this pineapple
I want something that
won't make me feel
like I'm in a nightmareish
situation I want
something that's savory and

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just
like this pizza pie
oh I want something just
like this pizza pie oh oh oh
I want something just like
this pizza pie oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
I want something just like this pe
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I had a pineapple on
my pizza and it didn
didn't quite go as planned
the cheese started to slide
and the juice seeped through the
crust and onto my hands
I'm not looking for a topping that's sour

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go now
how much you want to eat
I'm not finding anything that
tastes quite like this pineapple
I want something that
won't make me feel
like I'm in a nightmareish
situation I want

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like
this pizza pie oh oh oh

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just
like this pizza pie
oh oh oh oh oh oh
I want something just like this pe
I want something just like
this pizza pie oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to eat
I'm not finding anything that
tastes quite like this pineapple
I want something that
won't make me feel
like I'm in a nightmareish
situation I want
something that's savory and

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
