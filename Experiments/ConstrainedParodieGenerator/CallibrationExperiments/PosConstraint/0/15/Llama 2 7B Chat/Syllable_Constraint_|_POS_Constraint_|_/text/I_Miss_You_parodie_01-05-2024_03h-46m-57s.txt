[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the toppings on my pizza
the juicy sweetness in disguise of a
a tropical nightmare un
we can live without pineapp
and pizza will be great forevermore and
in the oven it will ro
and we'll wish this never ends pizza
and we'll wish this never ends pizza will
be forevermore and

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor you promised
the sweetness that was never delivered
the taste of disappointment and
the aroma of
mediocre toppings united in dis
and as I stare at the pie
the toppings of regret and
the pineapple that could have been so
much more than this mediocre
and hear the voice of reason
saying pineapple doesn't belong on
saying pineapple

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time with pineapple on your
the flavor of regret
don't waste your time with
pizza will be great forevermore and we
will wish this never ends
pizza will be greatfore

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time with pineapple on your
the flavor of regret
don't waste your time with
pizza will be great forevermore and we
will wish this never ends
pizza will be greatfore
don't waste your time with pineapple on your
the flavor of regret
don't waste your time with
pizza will be great forevermore and we
will wish this never ends
pizza will be greatfore

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
