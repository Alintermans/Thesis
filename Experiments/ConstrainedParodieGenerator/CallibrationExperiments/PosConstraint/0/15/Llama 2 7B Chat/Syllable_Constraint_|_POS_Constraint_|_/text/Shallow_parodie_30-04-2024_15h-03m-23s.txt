[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground

I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the pineapple

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the haha shallow
in the haha la la la low don
in the haha shallow
we're far from the pineapple
