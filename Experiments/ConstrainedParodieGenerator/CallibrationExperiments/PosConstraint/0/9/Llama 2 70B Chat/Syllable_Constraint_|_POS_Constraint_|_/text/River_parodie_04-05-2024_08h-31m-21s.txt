[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolhardy taking
pineapple on my pizza
it's a sinful delight that I can't ignore like a moth
to a flame it draws me in with its sweet and savory
flavors dancing on my taste bud
but little do I know the lies I tell myself
if all it's gonna cause

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm coming home with a stomachache from e
excess cheese and pepperoni
regretting my decision to put
pineapple on my pizza in the first place and
now it's too late I've already committed the
sin of putting fruit on a beautiful
piece of dough and now it's ruined forever like a scar
on a beautiful face and I can't erase the mistake I made
like a tattoo that I can
cover up with makeup but still visible to the trained
eye and I can't help but wonder what could have
been if I had just stuck to the basics like a simple
margherita or pepperon
I but no I had to go and be adventurous
and now I'm paying the price for my recklessness and my glutton
y like a dog returning to its vomit
I can't seem to learn from my mistakes

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolhardy taking
pineapple on my pizza
it's a sinful delight that I can't ignore like a moth
to a flame it draws me in with its sweet and savory
flavors dancing on my taste bud
but little do I know the lies I tell myself
if all it's gonna cause

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one pizza turned into two slices
now I'm stuffed and feeling quite nice but at what cost
I sacrificed my taste buds and my digni
ty for a moment of culinary ec
stasy and now I'm left with a stomachache and a
heavy heart and I can't help but wonder if it
was worth it and the answer is no it wasn't worth the
pain and suffering that I'm going through now and I can't help but think
about the pizza that could have been if I had just stuck to the script
like a quarterback who's lost his way and
thrown an interception instead of sticking to the
game plan and now I'm paying the price for my recklessness and
stupidity and I can't seem to learn
from my mistakes like a dog returning
to its vomit I can't seem to
break free from my gluttony and my desire
for something new and exciting even
if it means sacrific
ing my taste buds and my dignity and now
I'm left with nothing but a stomachache and regret and the
know

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolhardy taking
pineapple on my pizza
it's a sinful delight that I can't ignore like a moth
to a flame it draws me in with its sweet and savory
flavors dancing on my taste bud
but little do I know the lies I tell myself
if all it's gonna cause

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's river run call
meever
call
me river
we'll let the river run
down the drain like my dignity and

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride he
y fuck can I say if life was a high
way and gluttony was an enclave I'd be swerving in
five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin on ice
maybe that's why I came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
but I made you terminate my pizza
this culinary triangle left us in a
wreck tangled what else can I say it was fun
for a while bet I really woulda
loved your flavor didn't really want to ab
ort but fuck it what's one more lie to tell o

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a foolhardy taking
pineapple on my pizza
it's a sinful delight that I can't ignore like a moth
to a flame it
draws me in
with its sweet and savory flavors dan
cing on but
little do I know the lies tells
myself if all it's gonna cause is pain the truth
and my lies now are fall
