[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a crime having pineapple
on a beautiful pie that's just
a perfect combination of
sauce cheese and toppings all in harmony oh

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness that's new
but to me it's just a bitter
betrayal of the flavors that we know oh
like putting ketchup on a hot
dog or mayonnaise on a taco
it's just not something that we do oh no no

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong

[Verse 3]
you argue it's a matter of
personal taste and preference
but when it comes to pizza we must insist
on the classic toppings that we love the
most pepperoni sausage and
mushrooms please don't you forget oh yeah yeah

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong

[Verse 4]
I know you think you're being bold
and adventurous with your pineap
ple choice but to me it's just a faux pas oh
like wearing white socks with a suit
or singing off key in a cho
rus it's just not something that we do no no

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong
oh pineapple on pizza oh
oh how it just don't belong
oh pineapple on pizza oh

[Outro]
pineapple on pizza oh oh

[Additional Lyrics]
you say you love the way it
tastes but to me it's just a shame
how could you do this to a beautiful pie
it's like putting graffiti on the mon
a lisa or painting a must
ache on the venus de milo oh no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
I know you think you're being hip
and trendy with your pineapple
pizza but to me it's just a slip up oh
like wearing skinny jeans that are too
tight or using a filter on
your instagram that's just too bright oh yeah yeah yeah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a time and place
for pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a cold and broken dream
a culinary abomination
that I just can't condone oh no
no no no no no no no no no no no no
