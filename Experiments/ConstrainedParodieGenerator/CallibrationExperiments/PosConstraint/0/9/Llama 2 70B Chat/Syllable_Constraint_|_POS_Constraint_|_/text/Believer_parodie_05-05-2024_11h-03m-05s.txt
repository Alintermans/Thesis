[Verse 1]
first things first
I got a message that's burning in me
I'm fired up and tired of
the way that pizza's been neglect
the way that pizza's been neglect

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you tell me what you think that I should eat
I'm the one who knows what
I'm the master of my taste buds sea
the master of my taste buds sea

[Pre-Chorus]
I was confused from a young age
taking my anger to the masses
writing my poems for the few
that look at me funny when I say no pineapple
singing from my heartache from the
pain of eating something so wrong
taking my message from my brain
seeing the beauty through the no

[Chorus]
pineapple you made me a you made
me a believer bel
ievever pineapple you break me
down you build me up bel
ievever pineapple oh let the haters
fly oh let them rain my life my love
my stomach it came from no no no
pineapple you made me

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the ones up above
all the hate that you've heard
has turned your stomach to a dove oh oh
your stomach up above oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was choking in the crowd
building my rage up in the cloud
falling like pepperoni to
the ground hoping my feelings they
would drown but they never did ever lived ebbing and
flowing inhibited limited till it broke open and
rained down it ra

[Chorus]
pineapple you made me a you made
me a believer bel
ievever pineapple you break me
down you build me up bel
ievever pineapple oh let the haters
fly oh let them rain my life my love
my stomach it came from no no no
pineapple you made me

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the oven and the heat
you're the face of the future
the pizza in my belly
the pizza in my belly

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited till it broke open and rained down
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pineapple you made me a you made
me a believer bel
ievever pineapple you break me
down you build me up bel
ievever pineapple oh let the haters
fly oh let them rain my life my love
my stomach it came from no no no
pineapple you made me
