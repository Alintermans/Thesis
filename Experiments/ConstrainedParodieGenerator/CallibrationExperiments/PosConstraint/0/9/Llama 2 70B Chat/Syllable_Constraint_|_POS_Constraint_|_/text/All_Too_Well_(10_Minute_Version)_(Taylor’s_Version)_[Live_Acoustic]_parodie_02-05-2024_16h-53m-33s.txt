[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong it was
like a crime scene without a care but something

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory gaze autumn
leaves falling down like anchovies in disgra
we're ordering at the counter getting lost in
toppings and I can picture it after all

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pepperonI's not here
and I might be okay but my taste buds are not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost chose the wrong topping because you were looking at
me sausage instead of pe
we're singing in the car getting

[Verse 3]
photo album on the fridge your pizza preferences
were turning into a mess you used to be a little kid with a
favorite topping in a food coma and your mom's telling
stories bout you on the pepperoni team you told
me bout your past thinking your future was cheese and you were toss
ing me the slice keys fuck the pineapple lovers
key chain on the ground we were always skipping town and
I was thinking on the drive down any time now he's he
going to say it's love you will
call it what it was til we were dead and gone
and buried check the pulse and
come back swearing it's the same after three months in the grave
and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for

[Pre-Chorus]
you but all I felt was shame
and you held my lifeless slice frame
and I know it's long gone and there was not
else I could do and I forget

[Chorus]
about you long enough to forget why I need
ed to remember it all too well cause there we are again
in the middle of the
night we're dancing round the kitchen
in the refrigerator light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too well and there we are a
gain when nobody had
to know you kept me like a secret

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paper here
cause I remember it all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my taste
you said if we had been closer in flavor maybe it would have been
fine and that made me want to
die the idea you had of me who was
she a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
not weeping in a party bathroom
some pizza asking me what happened you
that's what happened you
you who charted my dad with self effacing
jokes sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come
and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my toppings and I walk home a
lone but you keep my old favorite from that first
week cause it reminds you of innocence and it tells
like me you can't get rid
of it cause you remember it all

[Chorus]
too cause there we are again when I loved
you so back before you lost the one real thing you've e
ver known It was rare I
was there I remember it all
too well wind in my hair you
were there you remember
it all down the stairs you
were there you remember
it all it was rare you
remember it all too well wind

[Verse 6]
in my hair I was there and I was never good at telling
jokes but the punch line goes I'll get older but
your lovers stay my age from when your bro
oklyn broke my skin and bones I'm a soldier
who's returning half her weight and did
the twin flame bruise paint you blue just between us did
the love affair maim you too
cause in this city's barren cold I still
remember the first fall of snow
and how it glistened as it fell

[Outro]
I remember it all too well just between us did the
love affair maim you all too well just between us do
you remember it all too well just between us I remember
it all too well wind in my hair I was
there down the stairs I was there sacred
prayer I was there it was rare you too
well wind in my hair I was there down the sta
irs I was there sacred prayer I was there
it was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was there
down the stairs I was there sacred
prayer I was there it was rare you remem
ber it all too well wind in my hair
I was there down the stairs I was there
sacred prayer I was there it was
rare you remember it all too well wind
in my hair I was there down the too
well wind in my hair I was there down
the stairs I was there sacred prayer I was there

[Spoken Outro]
I love pineapples so
