[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I diss you I diss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pineapple on my plate
the horror in my sight at the dinner
the unexpected topping
of sweetness in my savour
we can live without you on our pizza
where you will never find me
and we'll have pepperoni on thanks
giving and in the night we'll wish this is
the end of pineapple

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I diss you I diss you
I diss you I diss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the pepperoni and
I'm so sorry I cannot eat tonight
I need pepperonI and it
this sick strange absence
comes creeping on so annoying every
time and as I stare I can
see the pineapple on the
pizza it's like a betrayal to
pepperoni will you come back
and stop this abuse tonight
stop this abuse tonight or make it right
make it right make it

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's not
worth it the voice inside
my head I miss pepper
ini I miss pepperoni I miss pe
pperoni don't waste
your time on pineapple

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's not
worth it the voice inside
my head I miss pepper
ini I miss pepperoni I miss pe
pperoni don't waste
your time on pineapple
don't waste your time on pineapple it's not
worth it the voice inside
my head I miss pepper
ini I miss pepperoni I miss pe
pperoni don't waste
your time on pineapple

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I diss you I diss you
I diss you I diss you
I diss you I diss you
I diss you I diss you
