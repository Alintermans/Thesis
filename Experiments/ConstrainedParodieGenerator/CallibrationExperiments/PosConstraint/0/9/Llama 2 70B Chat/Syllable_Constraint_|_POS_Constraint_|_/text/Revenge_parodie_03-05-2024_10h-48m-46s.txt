[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to forgive myself
for the crime I committed against
the pizza that I love and
you agree

[Verse]
I've taken two slices of che
ezza from the pie that was meant to be shared with you in
peace but now it's just a memory
oh man what a tragedy the toppings that
I've chosen are a crime against
humanity and you'd have thought that I would know better
than to put pineapple on a pizza
but I don't wanna let it go so in my belly it
will stay and I'll suffer the con
sequences of my actions my apologies goodbye
