[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' while we're meetin' some people say
it's a topping that's quite neat but I don
t think it's somethin' that I'd be
eatin' on a pie that's meant to be sav
ory not sweet that's just how I feel about it and
I'm hopin' that you feel the same
about this topping
that's causin' such debate do you ever get the feelin' that
it just don't belong does it stick around like

[Pre-Chorus]
summat in your teeth that you can't seem to get
out no matter how much you drink or how much you eat
is it just me or does it seem like a crime to
put pineapple on a pizza that's just meant to be

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
way that pizza used to be
ever thought of
leavin' pine off
your pie maybe
I'm too busy lov
in' pizza the way that it
should be to fall for
somebody new who

[Verse 2]
puts pineapple on their
pizza and thinks that it's okay to do
I've been wonderin' if you're still open to
tryin' pizza the way that it was meant to be made do
you feel the same as I do or are you just gonna ignore
the way that pizza's meant to be enjoyed and if so
I'm sorry to interrupt but I gotta let

[Pre-Chorus]
summat in your teeth that you can't seem to get
out no matter how much you drink or how much you eat
is it just me or does it seem like a crime to
put pineapple on a pizza that's just meant to be

[Chorus]
you know how I feel about this topping
ever thought of leavin' it
off maybe I'm too busy
bein' right about this to fall for
somebody new who puts pineapple on
their pizza and thinks that it's al
right to do without even
askin' how I feel
about this topping

[Outro]
do you wanna know how I feel about this to
pping do you wanna know if this feelin' flows both ways
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't be
long on a pizza that's just the way that it is and
if you wanna be with me you gotta understand
that pineapple on a pizza is just not someth
in' that I can stand so do you want me crawlin' back to
