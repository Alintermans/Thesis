[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain it clear
it doesn't belong there

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to collect my thought before I
start to rant about this ab
horrent topping that you see
on a beautiful pie that
should be savory not sweet oh
why must you ruin it with that
fruit that just doesn't belong
I know you think you're being unique but it's just
a travesty oh so wrong would you put
apples on a steak or peaches in a burrito no you wouldn't
so why do it to a poor
defenseless pizza oh please
stop the insanity now it's time to take a stand
and make a change for the better

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
tragedy it's a shame how could you do this to me
I wish I could explain it better it's a crime against human
ity pineapple does not

[Verse 2]
belong on a pizza it's a fact
you can't argue with science or
the culinary arts pineapple is not
a topping it's a fruit that's meant to be
enjoyed on its own or in
a smoothie not on top of a pie
that's meant to be savory and
delicious not sweet and gross

[Verse 3]
I don't know what you're thinking or what you're trying to
prove putting pineapple on a pizza
is a sin it's a crime against pizza lovers
everywhere it's time to take a stand and make
a change for the better so listen up
and pay attention don't be a
pineapple pizza offender don't be the one who ru
ins the meal for everyone else be considerate
and respect the art of pizza making the way it was
meant to be savory and delicious not

[Outro]
ruined by a fruit that doesn
t belong so please for the love of
pizza and all that is good
keep pineapple off the menu and out
of
our
life
forev
er you
