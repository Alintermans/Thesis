[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
defies all logic and reasonably sound
it's a topping that just
won't ever be my favorite flav
I'll stick to the classics like pepperoni and sa
because pineapple just

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I i am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lung
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say pineapple
pineapple
I said pineapple what's going
on a pizza oh no
pineapple
I said pineapple what's going

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh oh u
oh oh
oh
oh oh u

[Verse 2]
I know some
think it's a tropical
treat but for me it
just doesn't computea
can't comp
with the rest of the to
ppings it's just not my cup of tea
I'll stick to the class

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I i am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lung
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say pineapple
pineapple
I said pineapple what's go
on a pizza oh no
pineapple
I said pineapple what's goining
on a pizza oh no
pizza without pineapple is like
football game
without the cheerleaders football game
without the
cheerleaders pizza without the
pineapple is like a
football game without the cheerleaders
oh no no no no
no no no no no no no no no
no no no
no no no no no no no no

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh oh u

[Outro]
twenty five years and my life
is still trying to get up that great big hill
of hope for a destinah
