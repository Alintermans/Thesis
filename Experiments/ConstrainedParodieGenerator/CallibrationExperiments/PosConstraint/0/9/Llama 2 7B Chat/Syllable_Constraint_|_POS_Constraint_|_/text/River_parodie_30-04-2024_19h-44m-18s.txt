[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fan of pineapple
on my pizza had to take
been a lover of the sweet and tangy taste for years now it
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is hate
my love for pineapple now is falling like the
rain so let the river

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's coming home with his taste buds singed to catch
flack sweet and sour and spicy
on his breath jack he's a pineapple
lover and he just wants to exact revenge and
it's a culinary chess match he's on my back
like a jetpack he's been tracking all the
toppings and guess who just happens to be moving on to
the next actually just shit on my last pizza and she has what
my ex lacked love for pineapp
actually I know she's using me to try to top
him but she's devised some plan to put me in the
kitchen with a knife in hand and say their relationship
hanging by a strand so she's been
on the internet lately and says maybe she'll be
my mozzarella stacy to spite her man but I shoulda said
bye suzanne after the first slice but tonight
I am and the truth and my toppings now

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fan of pineapple
on my pizza had to take
been a lover of the sweet and tangy taste for years now it
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is hate
my love for pineapple now is falling like the
rain so let the river

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two day stand turn
it was come last bite so we hug tight and and he
found out now he feels deserted and used cause
he left so what he did first to her too now
how am I supposed to tell this pizza that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm hungry nervous and sue
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the kitchen like hole in wall diners don't have
to be reserved in a box I just feel
like the person who I'm turning into is irrede
I preyed on you like a church at the pew and now that I got
you I don't want you took advantage in
my thirst to pursue and now that I got
you to the oven with a knife in
hand we can't bring you to this world shoulda knew
to use protection before I bit the
forbidden fruit fuck it
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your toppings too didn't really
wan

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
