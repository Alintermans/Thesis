[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
how could you even consider such a sin
it's like putting ketchup on a hot dog in
disgusting and wrong in every way it

[Verse 2]
the cheese is melted to perfection without it and
the sauce is tangy and sweet without the need
it's like someone took a perfectly good pizza
and ruined it with a ridiculous to

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's wrong but you
just can't help yourself when
you see that juicy pineapple slice calling your
name with its

[Chorus]
because there it is again on the little
pizza pie and it's driving me crazy the way you insist
on putting pineapple where
it doesn't belong and I can

[Verse 3]
I don't know what you see in that tropical fruit but
I don't want any part of it when it comes to my pizza and
I'll stick to the classics thank you very much pepperoni
sausage and mushrooms are where it's at for me please don
don't even get me started on bacon because I know
exactly how you feel about pineapple on
a pizza it's like a sinful indulgence that you
just can't resist so please for the love of pizza don
t leave that pineapple on the
island where it belongs because when it comes
to pizza toppings I know
what I want and it ain't pineapple by any means
or any other fruit for that matter it's just plain

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's wrong but you
just can't help yourself when you
see that juicy pineapple slice calling
your name with its sweet and tangy

[Chorus]
because there it is again on the littlepizz
ia pie and it's driving me crazy the way you insist
on putting pineapple
where It doesn't belong and I
can't help but wonder why you would do such a thing
to a perfectly good pizza when there are so many
other toppings to choose
from it's like you're intentionally

[Bridge]
ruining a good thing just for the sake
of having something new and
exciting and different and I get
that it can be fun
to try new things and all
but when it comes to pizza to
ppings I know what I like and it ain't pineapple by a
long shot so please just leave it alone and let me enjoymy
pizza in peace because when it comes to pizza
toppings I know what I want and

[Verse 4]
I know you think you're being adventurous and bold
but trust me when I say you're just being
disrespectful to the pizza and to me when you put pineapple
on there it's like you're taking
a sledgehammer to a delicate flower
and I can't help but feel a sense of sadness and disappointment when
I see that pineapple slice staring
back at me with its juicy sweetness and
tangy flavor but
I know I can't stop you from putting it
there so I just have to politely decline and
hope that you'll see the error of your ways and leave the pineapple
for the island where it belongs because when it comes to

[Verse 5]
pizza is a beautiful thing and it deser
deserves to be treated with respect and care and not abused or mist
treated like a plaything to be experimented
with and when you put pineapple on a pizza
you're not respecting the pizza or the people
who enjoy it the way it's meant to be enjoyed and
I hope you can understand
my perspective on this matter and

[Chorus]
because there it is again on the li
ttle pizza pie and it's driving me crazy the way
you insist on putting
pineapple where it doesn't when
I can't help but wonder
why you would do such a
thing to a perfectly
good pizza when there are
so many other to
ppings to choose from it's like you're in

[Verse 6]
I know I'm not alone in this feeling and there are plenty
of people who agree with me when it comes
to pineapple on pizza and I hope
you'll listen to their perspectives and see things
from their point of view because when it
comes to pizza toppings I know what I want and
it ain't pineapple and
I hope you can understand my point of
view and respect my wishes when
it comes to my pizza because
