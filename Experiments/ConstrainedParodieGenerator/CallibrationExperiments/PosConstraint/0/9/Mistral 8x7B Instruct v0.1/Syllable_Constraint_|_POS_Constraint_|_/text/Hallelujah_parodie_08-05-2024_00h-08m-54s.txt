[Verse 1]
now I've heard there's a culinary
abomination that's a pity
pineapple on a pizza pie yeah you know it
it clashes with the cheese and sauce
the sweet and savory collide
the taste buds cringe at this monstrosity inc

[Chorus]
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no

[Verse 2]
you thought it seemed like fun to try it
but one bite made you regret it
the flavors warring on your tongue yeah they def
confused your senses and your mind
left you searching for something kinder
than this bitter taste of pineapple and dough

[Chorus]
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no

[Verse 3]
they say it's just a matter of
taste but you beg to differ man
it's a crime against the pizza gods up high
the toppings should complement each other
not fight for dominance like this
the sauce and cheese should work in tandem glory

[Chorus]
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no

[Verse 4]
you tried to make it work you did
but it's just not worth the effort you
spent trying to convince yourself it could be
it's time to move on and embrace
a better pizza destiny
with nothing on your slice but pepperoni

[Chorus]
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no
no no pineapple pizza no

[Outro]
no no pineapple pizza no

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I tried it once for
the sake of trying something new
but now I know the truth and I won't go
back to that place of culinary sin
it's just not meant to be combined
it's a cold and it's a broken pizza hallel

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time I thought I could
acquire a taste for it you
know but now I know it's just not meant to be
and I'll stick with my classic pepper
oni or maybe some sausage
but no more pineapple on my pizza please oh

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe some people like the
contrast of sweet and savory
but I'm not one of them and I never will
be and I'll never understand why they
do when there are so many better
toppings to choose from and enjoy instead of this
