[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go ical error
don't you dare put pineapple here
it's a culinary blunder
if the heavens ever did speak
they'd forbid that combo
every bite's a mistake to
make you want to disown
we were born with taste buds pure and true
my pizza should be sacred too
but pineapple on pizza's a sin
I was born with gustatory sense
don't tell me pineapple
is the way to win me over
take it off and then we

[Pre-Chorus]
a menow
menowamen

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
far from my pizza pie and slice it right in two
I'll tell you what I hate and you can take it to
offer me a savory
oh good gravy let me keep my life
keep pineapple
far from my pizza pie and slice it right in two
I'll tell you what I hate and you can take it to
offer me a savory
oh good gravy let me keep my life

[Verse 2]
if I'm a lover of all things che
esy and warm in the
oven can't you see that pine
apple doesn't belong here
drain the olive oil make it juicy
something savory for the main
course that's a monstrosity
what you got in the freezer
we've a lot of pepperoni
that looks delicious that looks ple
asing to my pal

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
far from my pizza pie and slice it right in two
I'll tell you what I hate and you can take it to
offer me a savory
oh good gravy let me keep my life
keep pineapple
far from my pizza pie and slice it right in two
I'll tell you what I hate and you can take it to
offer me a savory
oh good gravy let me keep my life

[Bridge]
no pineapple allowed when the pizza's divine
the only toppings worthy are the ones we call divine
in the madness and hunger of that savory
scene only then I am satisfied only then do

[Pre-Chorus]
a menow men
owamenow

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
far from my pizza pie and slice it right in two
I'll tell you what I hate and you can take it to
offer me a savory
oh good gravy let me keep my life
keep pineapple
far from my pizza pie and slice it right in two
I'll tell you what I hate and you can take it to
offer me a savory
oh good gravy let me keep my life
