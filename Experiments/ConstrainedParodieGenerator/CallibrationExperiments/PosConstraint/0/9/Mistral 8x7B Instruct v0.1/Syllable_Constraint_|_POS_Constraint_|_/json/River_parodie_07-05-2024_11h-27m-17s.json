He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nbut it's a sin that's hard to define in rhyme or reason's line\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with his plate filled up wanting\npineapple on pizza causing\nan uproar of laughter and disgust\nbut he just can't get enough of the sweet and\ntangy taste on his tongue it's a must have on his\nlate night cravings but she just wants to ban\nit from their lives saying it doesn't belong on a pie\nit's a travesty he thinks she's crazy but he can't deny that\nit's a guilty pleasure he\ncan't resist so he sneaks a slice when she's not around\nit's a cheat but he can't help himself around\nthe temptation of the sweet and sour sensation of\npineapple on pizza he knows\nit's wrong but he can't resist the combination\nof cheese and ham with the fruity addition it's a slippery\nslope but he can't help himself from sliding\ndown the path of pineapple on pizza\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nbut it's a sin that's hard to define in rhyme or reason's line\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one night stand turned a two night stand it\nwas a joke at first but now he can't resist\nthe sweet and tangy taste of pineapple on\npizza it's a craving he can't resist\nnow he's hooked on the combination of flavors it\ntantalizes his taste buds and leaves him wanting more\nbut she just can't understand why he would ruin a\nperfect pizza with the addition of pineapple it's a sin in her\neyes but he just can't help himself from indulging in the forbid\nden fruit on his pizza it's a guilty\npleasure he can't resist but he knows it's not right\nto keep it from her so he confesses his love for pineap\nple on pizza and she can't believe what\nshe's hearing but she loves him so she forg\nives him and they continue to share\npizzas together but the thought of pineapple\non pizza still lingers in the back of\nher mind and she can't\nhelp but wonder if it's worth the risk of ru\nining a perfect pizza with the addition of pineap\nple\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's river my name\nis pine\non\npizza let\nthe river run call me\npineapple let the river run the\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the favorite topping never\ngiven a chance hey fuck can I say if\nlife was a pizza and pineapple was an option it\nwould be the first thing I'd choose but she just can't see\nthe appeal of it on her pizza it\ndoesn't belong she says but\nI can't help myself I'm addicted\nto the sweet and tangy taste of pineapple on\npizza it's a guilty pleasure I can't\nresist but I know it's not right to\nkeep it from her so I confess my love for\npineapple on pizza and she can't bel\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nbut it's a sin that's hard to define in rhyme or reason's line\nwell little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\ns gonna cause is pain the truth\nand my lies now are falling like the rain so let\n",
