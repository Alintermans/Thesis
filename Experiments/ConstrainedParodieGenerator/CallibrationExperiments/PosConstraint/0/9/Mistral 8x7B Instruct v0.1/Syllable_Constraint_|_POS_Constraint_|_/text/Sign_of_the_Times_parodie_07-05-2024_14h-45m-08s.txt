[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a culinary crime
don't you think it's gross inside
you can't cover up the taste with extra cheese
it's just wrong on a pizza
it's a crime against taste bud

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
loathe and loathe again and
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
loathe and loathe again and

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
put down that pineapple slice and hear me
they said it's not a real pizza
we gotta get away from this

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a disaster waiting
tomato sauce and cheese con
remember you can always get a side
of pineapple chunks instead
somewhere far away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
loathe and loathe again and
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
loathe and loathe again and

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
stop eating that pineapple slice and hear me
they said it's not a real pizza
we gotta get away from this

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
loathe and loathe again and
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food we
loathe and loathe again and

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
about what makes a
good pizza pie should be
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my plea at
we gotta get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got
to get away we got to get
away we got to get away
