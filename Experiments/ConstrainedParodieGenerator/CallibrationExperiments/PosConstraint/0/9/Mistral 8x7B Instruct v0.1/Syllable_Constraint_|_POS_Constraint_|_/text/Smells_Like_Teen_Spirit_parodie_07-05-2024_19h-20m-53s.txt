[Verse 1]
skip the guns and leave the friends
no joy in loss or make believe
she's tired quick and filled with dread illed
no room for pineapple on this

[Pre-Chorus]
no way say high to such a low
no way say high to such a low
no way say high to such a low
no way say high to such

[Chorus]
with the taste off it's not delightful
here we stand against this fight us
it's sickening and unappet
here we stand against this fight us
a sin to mar our tasty
a lie to claim it pleases us

[Post-Chorus]
no way hey

[Verse 2]
it fails at what it should exc
and for this flawed idea
our small group says no way ever
and always will until it leaves

[Pre-Chorus]
no way say high to such a low
no way say high to such a low
no way say high to such a low
no way say high to such

[Chorus]
with the taste off it's not delightful
here we stand against this fight us
it's sickening and unappet
here we stand against this fight us
a sin to mar our tasty
a lie to claim it pleases us

[Post-Chorus]
no way hey

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I don't know just what it
oh yeah I see it ruins taste
I struggled hard to keep it off
oh well no way never minded

[Pre-Chorus]
no way say high to such a low
no way say high to such a low
no way say high to such a low
no way say high to such

[Chorus]
with the taste off it's not delightful
here we stand against this fight us
it's sickening and unappet
here we stand against this fight us
a sin to mar our tasty
a lie to claim it pleases us

[Outro]
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial
