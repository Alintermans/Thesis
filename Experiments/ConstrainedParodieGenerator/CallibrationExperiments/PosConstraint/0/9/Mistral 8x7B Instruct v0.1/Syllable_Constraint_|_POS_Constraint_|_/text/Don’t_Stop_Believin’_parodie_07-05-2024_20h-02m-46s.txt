[Verse 1]
just a small town slicefar from a pineapple
a classic pie with cheese and pepperoni
there's no room for fruit on a savory dishlike
that sweet and tangy taste just doesn't fit in

[Verse 2]
a bite of pizza in the moon
the taste of tomato sauce and
a mouthful of pineapple is
just so very wrong it goes on and

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
arguing up and down the
pizzeria line searching for
crust and cheese not
fruity concoctions hiding in
disguise as pizza toppings

[Verse 3]
striving hard to taste the best
pizza is the ultimate
test of culinary prowess no
pineapple chunks

[Verse 4]
some may like the sweetness
but true pizza lovers know
the truth of the matter is
it just doesn't belong on pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
arguing up and down the
pizzeria line searching for
crust and cheese not
fruity concoctions hiding in
disguise as pizza toppings

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't add pineapple
hold on to the pizza
crust tradition
don't add pineapple
hold on
pizza crust and
don't add pineapple
hold on to the pizza
crust tradition
