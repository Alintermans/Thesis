[Intro]
come on folks, it's time to speak the truth

[Verse 1]
firmly opposed
pineapple on pizza pos
its taste just doesn't belong the palm of your
hand could be holding a slice of
goodness instead
tomato sauce and cheese is all
you'll ever need no need to
let pineapple take the lead my friends oh

[Chorus]
in this world it just won
t do to have pineapple on a
pizza you know it's just
not right as it was once before as
it was as it was you
know it's just not the same

[Verse 2]
dial the phone
and order a pizza that
won't let you down like pineapple will
it's just not the same without
ham and pepper
don't settle for less than the
best my friends because you're worth
more than pineapple on a pizza oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world it just won
t do to have pineapple on a
pizza you know it's just
not right as it was once before as
it was as it was you
know it's just not the same

[Bridge]
stay away from the pineapple tray don
't even think about giving it a try leave behind
the pineapple and reach for the pepper
it's always better when you stick with tradition dear

[Outro]
as
it should be
no pineapple on a pizza you
know it's just not the same
