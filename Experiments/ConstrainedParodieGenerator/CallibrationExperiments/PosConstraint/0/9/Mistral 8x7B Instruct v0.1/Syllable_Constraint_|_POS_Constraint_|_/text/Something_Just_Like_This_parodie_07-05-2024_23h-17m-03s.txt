[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the trends
pineapple on pizza
it's a debate that desc
ends into a mess
of heated arguments
but I don't see the need for it to represent

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said won't you try it
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some controversial mix
just something simple
something I can't
miss on my dinner plate to
pair with my drink of choice
I want something just like that

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doododooo doododo
doododooo doodo
doododooo doododo
oh I want something just like that
doododooo doododo
doododooo doodo
doododooo doododo
oh I want something just like that
I want something just like that

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the trends
ham and pineapple mix
it just doesn't make sense
the sweet and savory
clash and offend my taste
but I'm not the kind of person for that kind

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk I
'm not looking for a pizza with
some controversial twist just
something simple and
classic that will last
something I can count on to
satisfy my hunger

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like that
I want something just like that

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like that
doododooo doododo
doododooo doodo
doododooo doododo
oh I want something just like that
doododooo doododo
doododooo doodo
prechorus chris martin

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some controversial twist
just something simple
and delicious that
will satisfy my hunger
something I can count on
I want something just like that

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like that
oh I want something just like that
oh I want something just like that
