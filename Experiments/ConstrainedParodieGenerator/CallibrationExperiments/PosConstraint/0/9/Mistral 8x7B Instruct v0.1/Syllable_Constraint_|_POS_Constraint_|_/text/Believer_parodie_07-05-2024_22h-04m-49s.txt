[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on my pizza
I won't stand for it no more
it's a culinary crisis
a culinary crisis for

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare tell me it's a delicacy
it's an outrage and a
disaster of gastronomy oh
disaster of gastronomy

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on pizzas classic
but this monstrosity is toodram
writing this poem for the few
that know pizza's true form to be without fruitiness
singing from horror at the thought
of pineapple roaming free on
a dish it has no business to
be a part of this beautiful

[Chorus]
travesty you made me a you made
me see the error of
letting pineapple near my pizza
believer believer
travesty you put it on a dish divine
and ruined it forevermore you
monstrosity believer belie
ver travesty you made

[Verse 3]
third things third
say a prayer for all pizza lovers
may their taste buds never
experience this abomination
this abomination up on

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking in my boots
at the sight of pineapple chunks
floating in tomato sauce no
amount of cheese can save it now
but they never did so devoid of tastebud joy
inhibited limited till it broke open and ruined
my appetite

[Chorus]
travesty you made me a you made
me see the error of
letting pineapple near my pizza
believer believer
travesty you put it on a dish divine
and ruined it forevermore you
monstrosity believer belie
ver travesty you made

[Verse 4]
last things last
for the love of all things sacred and pure
keep pineapple away from
my beloved pizza for sure
my beloved pizza for sure

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did so devoid of tastebud joy
inhibited limited till it broke open and ruined
my appetite

[Chorus]
travesty you made me a you made
me see the error of
letting pineapple near my pizza
believer believer
travesty you put it on a dish divine
and ruined it forevermore you
monstrosity believer belie
ver travesty you made
