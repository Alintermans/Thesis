[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I spit it out on my plate with disgust
you just laughed and said it's a delicacy

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet smile as you took another slice daring
I wrinkled my nose as I watched you savor
the taste of pineapple and cheese combined in a
traumatizing way that I can't forget

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's not for me
and I wish I could forget
but I can't erase that taste too well oh no
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it is again on that pizza slice
pineapple chunks glaring back at me like a bad advice in
disguise of a topping it
ruins the pizza for me all

[Verse 3]
trays of pizza laid out at the party scene missing a
single slice of pineapple free but I know it's there somewhere waiting
to haunt me I took a bite of every topping but that
one I couldn't bear to try again and again it
finds its way to me no matter how hard I try to avoid
pizza with pineapple on top I remember
it all too well oh no I remember it all too
well oh no I remember it all too well oh no no
no no no no no no no no
get it away from me I remember it
all too well oh no I can
never forget that taste oh no I remember it all
too well oh no I can't forget it all too well

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's not for me
and I wish I could forget pi
and I can't erase that taste too well
oh no oh no oh no oh no

[Chorus]
cause there it is again on that pizza slice a
monstrosity that should never have been on a pizza pie
ruins the pizza for
me all too well oh no I can
never forget that taste oh no I remember it
all too well oh no I can't forget it all too well
oh no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no

[Bridge]
well maybe I'm being too harsh someone
once said pineapple on a
pizza is a culinary master
piece but I call it
a crime against pizza
I remember it all too well
oh no I can't forget that taste oh no I remember
it all too well oh no I can't forget it all too well
oh no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no

[Verse 4]
I used to love pizza with all the toppings I could
fit on a slice but now I cringe at the
thought of pineapple on my pizza I can't believe I used to
eat it without a second
thought but now I know better I remember
the taste of pineapple on pizza and I'll never go back to that place
again oh no I remember it
all too well oh no I can't forget
that taste oh no it
haunts me to this day oh no I remember
it all too well oh no I can't forget it
all too well oh no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

[Verse 5]
time can't erase the memory of that taste
it lingers on my taste buds like a bad dream that won't fade away
I try to move on but every time I see a
pizza with pineapple on top I'm taken back
to that fateful day oh no I remember it
all too well oh no I can't forget that taste oh
no I remember it all
too well oh no I can't forget

[Chorus]
cause there it is again on that pizza
slice pineapple chunks glaring back at me like a bad
advice in disguise of
a topping it ruins theizza
for me all too well oh no
I can't forget that
taste oh no I can't
forget it all too well
oh no no no no no
no no no no no no no no

[Verse 6]
I'll never understand the appeal of pineapple on a
pizza it's a combination that shouldn't
exist but somehow it does and it ha
unts me every time I see a pizza
with pineapple on top I can't
escape the memory of that taste oh no I
remember it all too well
I'll never forget it oh no I can
t forget it all too well oh
no no no no no no no no

[Outro]
just between us I remember it all too well oh no
I can't forget that taste oh no I remember
it all too well oh no I can't forget it all too well oh
no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no
