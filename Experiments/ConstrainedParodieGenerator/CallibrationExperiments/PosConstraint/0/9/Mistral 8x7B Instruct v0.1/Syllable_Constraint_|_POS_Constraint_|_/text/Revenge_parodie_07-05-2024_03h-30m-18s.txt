[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to forget that sin
of putting pineapple on pizza
you agree there's no way to
forgive that

[Verse]
I've tasted two disasters for
my tastebuds' delight I can't ignore oh man what
a mistake it was to mix sweet and
savory in one dish would I do it ag
ain no way some like pineapple
on pizza but it's just not meant to be on a pie it
clashes with the taste and ruins the fe
ast I don't want that monstrosity in my mouth again
I've tasted two disasters for
my tastebuds' delight I can't ignore oh man what
a mistake it was to mix sweet and
savory in one dish would I do it ag
ain no way some like pineapple
on pizza but it's just not meant to be on a pie it
clashes with the taste and ruins the fe
ast I don't want that monstrosity in my mouth again

[Chorus]
in my mouth again
in my mouth again
in my mouth again and ag
ain and ag ain and
ain and ag again and ag
in my mouth again

[Outro]
in my mouth again
again again again
is my disgust your choice
is all of my disgust your choice
enjoy
