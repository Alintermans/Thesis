[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love my pie
topped with cheese up in the sky now
in the morning I take a slice too
discovering pineapple

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to savor each
bite of pepperonI's rich speech now
taste of pineapple brings a
frown upon my face and sighs so loud it
spoils the taste of every
bite I take and then regret
discovering my pizzas stand on cur
sed pillars of shame and regretful sweaty

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of protestors ringing
vegans shouting loudly in the street
be my veggie option you can
still be tasty without the pineapple
for some reason I can't explain
once I tasted it there was
never a savory
bite again when pineapple was

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a sick and silly trend
pineapple on a pizza to
take part I had to bend my taste bud
beliefs and now I can't pretend to
appreciate the taste of
pineapple on my pizza no
more a puppet to a trend I never should
ve followed in the first place oh no

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of protestors ringing
vegans shouting loudly in the street
be my veggie option you can
still be tasty without the pineapple
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't refuse me
never an apolog
etic bite again when pineap

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no no no no no
oh no no no no no
oh no no no no no
oh no no no no no

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no no no no no
hear the bells of protestors ringing
oh no no no no no
vegans shouting loudly in the street
oh no no no no no
be my veggie option you can
oh no no no no no
still be tasty without the pineapple
oh no no no no no
for some reason I can't explain
oh no no no no no
I know saint peter won't refuse me
oh no no no no no
never an apologetic

[Outro]
oh no no no
oh no no no
oh no
