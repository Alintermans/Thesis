[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
but it's a sin that's hard to define in rhyme or reason's line
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his plate filled up wanting
pineapple on pizza causing
an uproar of laughter and disgust
but he just can't get enough of the sweet and
tangy taste on his tongue it's a must have on his
late night cravings but she just wants to ban
it from their lives saying it doesn't belong on a pie
it's a travesty he thinks she's crazy but he can't deny that
it's a guilty pleasure he
can't resist so he sneaks a slice when she's not around
it's a cheat but he can't help himself around
the temptation of the sweet and sour sensation of
pineapple on pizza he knows
it's wrong but he can't resist the combination
of cheese and ham with the fruity addition it's a slippery
slope but he can't help himself from sliding
down the path of pineapple on pizza

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]

perfect pizza with the addition of pineapple it's a sin in her
eyes but he just can't help himself from indulging in the forbid
den fruit on his pizza it's a guilty
pleasure he can't resist but he knows it's not right
to keep it from her so he confesses his love for pineap
ple on pizza and she can't believe what
she's hearing but she loves him so she forg
ives him and they continue to share
pizzas together but the thought of pineapple
on pizza still lingers in the back of
her mind and she can't
help but wonder if it's worth the risk of ru
ining a perfect pizza with the addition of pineap
