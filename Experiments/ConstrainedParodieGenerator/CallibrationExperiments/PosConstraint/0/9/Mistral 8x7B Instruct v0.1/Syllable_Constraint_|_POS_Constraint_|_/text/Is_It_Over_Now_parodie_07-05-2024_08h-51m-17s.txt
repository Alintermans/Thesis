[Intro]
should pineapple belong on a pizza

[Verse 1]
when the box is delivered
with the cheese and tomato sauce
an anomaly appeared
the sweet and savour

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to the moment of truth later olly
you take a bite and your face turns so jolly olly olly
you dream of sweetness but the taste turns sour quickly oh no
you search for a flavour that's truly satisfying instead of

[Chorus]
was it over when you first saw it there on
was it over when you tasted the sweet and
salty combo together in
your mouth as you took a bite olly
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
should it be or should it

[Verse 2]
when you bit into the slice
with the ham and mushrooms
an anomaly appeared
the sweet and savoury

[Bridge]
and did you think I wouldn't notice
the combination
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza without
pineapple on it olly olly
only rumours of
my pizza without pineapple
oh lord I think about jump
ing off of very tall things
just to see you come running and say the one

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to the moment of truth later olly ol
ly you take a bite and your face turns so jolly olly olly olly
you dream of sweetness but the taste turns sour quickly oh no ol
ly you search for a flavour that's truly satisfying instead

[Chorus]
was it over when you first saw it there on
was it over when you tasted the sweet and
salty combo together in
your mouth as you took a bite olly
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
should it
is it or should it not
belong
on a pizza

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
the combination
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza without
pineapple on it olly olly
only rumours of
my pizza without pineapple
oh lord I think about jump
ing off of very tall thingsolly
just to see you come running and say the one

[Outro]
should it be or should it
should pineapple belong on a pizza olly olly ol
ly was it over then and is it ol
ly over now olly ol
ly was it over then
and is
it over now olly olly olly olly
