[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottles in hand looking so divine start
it started out with a slice now pineapple's on my slice
it was only a fixin' but now it's causing
a mess in my tummy and I can't digest
while others relish it I'm filled with regret and
now they're enjoying it and I'm filled with dread oh
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savouring the taste
it doesn't belong on
pizza base
let me go say it's not okay too late
and ruining the

[Chorus]
crime of putting pineapple on pizza
feelings of disgust rising
taste buds are despising it
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is calling me
open up my angry eyes
cause I'm mr can

[Guitar Solo]
