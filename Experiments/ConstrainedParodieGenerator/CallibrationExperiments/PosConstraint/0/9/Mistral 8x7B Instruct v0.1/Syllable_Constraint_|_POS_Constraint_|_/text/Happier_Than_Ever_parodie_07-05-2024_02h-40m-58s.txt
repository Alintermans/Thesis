[Verse 1]
let me ponder for a while and find a clever line
to write this parody tune
to tell you what to doo do
do you taste my recipes
or do you turn your nose at these
when you heard I put pineapple
on my pizza pie you said
I asked you to respect my choice back then you said
it's just a topping you decreed to add
but you ignored my plea and now I'm feeling sadder than before you

of my pizza pie but all you did was make
me want to throw it in the trash can so
don't waste my time I don't have
and don't try to make me change my mind I could talk about
every time you brought pineapple to the table
but I'd have an empty line because you never had a
legitimate reason to add it to the

[Outro]
you ruined my pizza pie
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just leave me alone now and forever
ah
ah ah
ah
ah ah
