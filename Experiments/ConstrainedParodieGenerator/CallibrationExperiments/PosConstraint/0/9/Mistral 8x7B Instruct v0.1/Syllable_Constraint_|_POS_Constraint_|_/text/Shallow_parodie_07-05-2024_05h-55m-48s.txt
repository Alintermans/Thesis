[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something' bout
that slice of pizza with pineapple
on top or not izz
it still a cheesy delight you got

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm revol
in every bite I'm cravin' a resolve
for change
in every slice I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
is that fruit on pizza your ploy or joy
or do you need more
another topping to explore for sure

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm revol
in every bite I'm cravin' a resolve
for change
in every slice I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I refuse
to try that fruit on cheese
pizza's gotta be pure and true to form no
fruits in the feast for me please

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the fruitless zone we res
on't serve pineapple on our
pizzas ever again we
won't give in to that trend

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ah ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I refuse
to try that fruit on cheese
pizza's gotta be pure and true to form no
fruits in the feast for me please

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the fruitless zone we
on't serve pineapple on our
pizzas ever again
we won't give in to that
