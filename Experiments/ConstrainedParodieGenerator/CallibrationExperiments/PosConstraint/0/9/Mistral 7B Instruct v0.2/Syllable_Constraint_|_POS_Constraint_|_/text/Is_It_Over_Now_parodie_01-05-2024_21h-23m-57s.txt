[Intro]
is it pineapple on the pizza pie

[Verse 1]
once the meal was maderight
cheese and tomatoes in the night
I savored every bite
but you insisted

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand slices later we see
your toppings on a pizza and it's not what it seems to be
you crave my taste before it called me an anarchist believe
you search in every pie for something purer than pineapple

[Chorus]
was it disastrous when she placed it on your
was it despicable when he added it
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you rejected it
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it pineapple on

[Verse 2]
when you lost control of taste
red sauce white pineapple
green chili on a plate mis
your new choice is my dis

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
there were arguments
at least I had the courtesy
to keep my palate out of
only rumors about my flavor
and my whispered sigh
oh pepperoni I think of
jumping off of very tall
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand arguments later ohno
if it's got ham or bacon I will surmise that you'll probably order
you crave my taste before it called me a vegetarian gone
you search in every store for something purer than pineapple

[Chorus]
was it tragic when she placed it on your plate
was it terrible when he added it to
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you rejected it
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it pineapple on
is it
is it pineap

[Bridge]
did I not notice see
there were arguments
at least I had the courtesy
to keep my preferences
only rumors about my flavor
and my whispered sigh
oh pepperoni I think of
jumping off of very tall
just to see you come running towards
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Outro]
arguments and oh lord
let's fast forward to a thousand takeout orders later oh
arguments and oh lord I was hoping
and say the one thing oh lord
I've been wanting oh lord
but no
is it pineapple on the pizza pie oh lord
