with anchovies and olives on a
she's fighting for tradition's sake but I just can
it's a battle of wills it's a culinary
she's cooked up a plan to save tradition
but I've got a craving for something new and exciting
why pineapple on a pizza she just doesn't understand it's a
'cause she's a purist passionate
and you don't top a pizza with no traditional
but she's devised some scheme to innovate our
pineapples in hand says our pizza's unique and bold
but I know she's using me to
hi suzanne but I shoulda said hi pineappleless
after the first slice but tonight I am loving the debate we
decide to agree to disagree letting
as long as we both enjoy our meal

it was coming home with a new topping in hand
he found out now she feels disappointed and
'cause he left it behind but he did it first to
now how am I supposed to explain this decision
it's hard to find the words I'm anxious nervous and tense
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't explain this in person to
so I revert to the oven like artisan bakeries steaming
I just feel like the person who I'm pand
I've exploited your love for my own desire to
why do I do this act that I do forsaking tradition
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and

always the dissenter never the one
pineapple on a pizza if life was
and deceit was a condiment I'd be spreading on five
laneways I may have came across you sideways false
that's why I may have put pineapple on
I can't keep my lies straight
but I made you abandon our child
this love triangle left us in a mess confused
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort but fucking
what's one more act to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pirate leading a

been a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on
all my sins need

truth and my lies now are falling
pineapple on a pizza causes such a comm
so let the river run
