[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that hawaii cooked and it caused a
disagreeable surprise for ya it goes like
this pineapple first then cheese and
tomatoes next the slippery
slide of flavors none can resist the hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 2]
your palate was strong but you needed
proof pineapple on a pizza
it seemed so wrong but then it stole ya senses
they twisted your taste buds into
a tangled mess and from your lips they
drew the hallelujah pineapple pie ded

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 3]
you say I made a culinar
y mistake I don't even
know the name but if I did what's it to ya
there's a mix of flavors in every
slice it doesn't matter which you
tried the savory or the sweet halleluj

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I tried to touch
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of taste
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Outro]
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this table I've eaten
this before I used to eat alone before
and I've seen your pineapple flag on the
margherita arch love is not
a victory march it's a cold and it's a strange

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy tomato was moved
too and every bite we took was halleluj

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to argue with someone who outcook
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's tasted the
light it's a cold and it's a broken halleluj
