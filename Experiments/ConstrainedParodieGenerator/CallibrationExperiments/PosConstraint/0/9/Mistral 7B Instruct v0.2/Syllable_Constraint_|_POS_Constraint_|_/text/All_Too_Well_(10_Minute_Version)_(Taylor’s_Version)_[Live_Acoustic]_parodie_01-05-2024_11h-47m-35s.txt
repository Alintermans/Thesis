[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it wasn't quite the same
and I left my slice behind at the pizza
place with pineapple chunks sticking out in a

[Verse 2]
oh your happy disposition and my puzzled gaze
we're arguing in the car trying to find
a decent place to eat without the pineapple
but I can picture it after this debate

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that peace is nowhere to be
and I might pretend to be okay but I'm not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little pizza
you almost choked on your slice because you were grimacing at
me pineapple in my hair
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter our disagreement grew
you used to be a lover of classic toppings in a regular
size bed but now it's all about the pineapple mania
you told me about your past loving pineapple on
your pizza but I knew it was a disaster waiting to
explode and you were tossing me the menu card
and I was thinking on the drive back home wondering
why oh why did we have to order that pineapple pie
'til we were dead and gone and buried
check the expiration date and come back reg
retting our decision
and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
but all I felt was disappointment and you held me

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light pineapple in the
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like a curse
vow renewal and we
to remember it all too well yeah

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I ordered too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
from the start my dear
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to disappoint me in the
name of being honest with the pineapple on top of it
I'm a crumpled up slice of regret lying here
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you compromise my taste
you said if we had stuck to the classic toppings maybe it would have
been fine but that made me want
to throw it all away and run away from
the pineapple madness once and for all with a new pizza place in mind
but you keep my old favorite slice
'cause it reminds you of nostalgia and it
smells like a mistake
you can't get rid of it memory of
all too well yeah I remember it all too well
wind in my hair I was there I was there down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well I remember it all

[Verse 5]
time won't fly I'm stuck in this pineapple filled
nightmare I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to
find a way to escape this pineapple paradise
after pepperoni days and nights when you made
me your only choice now you send me back my things
and I walk home alone but you keep my old slice from
that very first date keepsake
you can't get rid of it cause you

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I hated you
before you ruined my favorite food with pineap
please remember it all
wind in my hair I was there yes
down the stairs I was there yes
sacred prayer I was there
it was rare you remind
wind in my hair I was
down the stairs I was there
sacred prayer I was there yes it

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at making choices but the moral
goes I'll get older but your pineapple to
ppings stay the same from when your pineapple
broke my heart and bones I'm a warrior who
returns from the battlefield of taste
I'm a soldier who's returning half my weight back
did the pineapple passion
wound paint you blue just between us did the
love affair maim you too cause in
this city's barren cold I still

[Outro]
remember the first fall of cheese I remember it all
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well wind in my hair
I was there yes down the stairs I was there
sacred prayer I was there yes it was
it was rare you remember it all
wind in my hair I was there yes down the stairs
I was there sacred prayer I was there yes
it was rare you remember it all
wind in my hair I was there yes down
the stairs I was there sacred prayer
I was there it was rare you remember
wind in my hair I was there yes down
the stairs I was there sacred prayer yes
it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair I was there yes down the
stairs I was there sacred prayer yes it
was rare you remember it all too
well wind in my hair I was there yes down the

[Spoken Outro]
I hate you guys so much
