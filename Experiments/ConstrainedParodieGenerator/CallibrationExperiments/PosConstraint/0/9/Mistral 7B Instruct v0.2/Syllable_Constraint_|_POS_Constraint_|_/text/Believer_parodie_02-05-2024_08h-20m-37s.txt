[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
the taste that just won't persist

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you argue with me about this trendy
topping on my pizza
I'm the one in control of my che
the one in control of my che

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to love pizza plain and
simple as a child at the table
but then they introduced this fruit
and my taste buds started to quiver and quake in the
shaking me up from my pizza
saying it's deliciousness was
winning me over with its sweet
seeing the horror on my plate

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the pizza gods up
above for forgiveness
for this pineapple abomination
our tastebuds' forgiveness

[Pre-Chorus]
we were enjoying our
pizza night peacefully until
they added this tropical twist
our taste buds were feeling am
issed we were missing the savory blissfulness
of cheese and tomatoes and meats and herbs and spicefulness
it was a crime

[Verse 4]

by the grace of the pizza oven and
flames we'll stand firm against this
pineapple invasion on
our pizzapalaceand

[Pre-Chorus]
we'll continue to fight for our right to enjoy
our pizza as it was meant to be enjoyed no more pine
apple on top
