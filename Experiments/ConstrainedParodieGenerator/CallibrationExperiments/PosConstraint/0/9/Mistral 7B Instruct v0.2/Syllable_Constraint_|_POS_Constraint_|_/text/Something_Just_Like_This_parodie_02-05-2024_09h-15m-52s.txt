[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading labels on
the foods that we consume
pepperoni and ham
pineapple and its juice
vegetarian
vegan or gluten free
but I'm not the type who'd put pineapple on the tree

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said eat whatever suits
how adventurous can
I'm not craving for somebody
with an exotic palate
just something simple
a traditional
just something I can lean on
someone I can depend
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doodoodoobidodo
doodoodoobidod
doodoodoobidodo
oh I want something just like this
doodoodoobidodo
doodoodoobidod
doodoodoobidodo
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading labels on
the foods that we consume
pepperoni and ham
pineapple and its juice
vegetarian or
vegan or gluten free
but I'm not the type who'd put pineapple on

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said eat whatever floats your
curiosity and
I'm not looking for somebody
with an exotic craving
just something simple
a classic platter
just something I can lean on
someone I can depend

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doodoodoobidodo
doodoodoobidod
doodoodoobidodo
oh I want something just like this
doodoodoobidodo
doodoodoobidod
doodoodoobidodo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for somebody
with an experimental
just something simple
a traditional
just something I can turn to
someone I can missy
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
