[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
her sense of humor's amusing a
pineapple on a pizza's disgrace
I should've spoken up before
if the foodie gods ever did
pineapple is the last
topping I'd ever ask for tonight
we were born with differ
ent tastes they say it's true but she ins
ists on this culinary sin
I was born hating pineapple but
I'll give it a try for you baby
command me to love it or
eat it plain old pepperoni
was born hating it but

[Pre-Chorus]
a hunger
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
worship at the shrine of this fruit's lies deception
tell you my aversions and you can prepare the
offer me that flavorless
oh good cook let me give you my taste
take me to the
worship at the shrine of this fruit's lies deception
tell you my aversions and you can prepare the
offer me that flavorless
oh good cook let me give you my taste

[Verse 2]
if I'm a picky eater of the
pineapple's the savior
to keep this fusion on my side
she demands a compromise
remove all other toppings find som
ethin' sweeter for the main course
that's a fine looking dish horse
what you got on the menu
we've a lot of unsatisfied
hungry bellies in the kitchen
this is hunger work

[Chorus]
take me to the
worship at the shrine of this fruit's lies deception
tell you my aversions and you can prepare the
offer me that flavorless
oh good cook let me give you my taste
take me to the
worship at the shrine of this fruit's lies deception
tell you my aversions and you can prepare the
offer me that flavorless
oh good cook let me give you my taste

[Bridge]
no masters or kings when the culinary cre
ation begins there is no sweeter harmony than us
in the chaos and kitchen of that delicious
scene only then I am human only then I am

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
worship at the shrine of this fruit's lies deception
tell you my aversions and you can prepare the
offer me that flavorless
oh good cook let me give you my taste
take me to the
worship at the shrine of this fruit's lies deception
tell you my aversions and you can prepare the
offer me that flavorless
oh good cook let me give you my taste
