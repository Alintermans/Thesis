[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our culinary scene
I'm tastier than ever been
wish I could make it clear

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to think of something clever
to create a recipe
to serve myself a better
dish than the pineapple pie
do you read my food reviews sinc
or do you skip the pineapple
when you said you'd try something
was I even on your menuplaned it wrong
I knew when I asked you to share a slice
you'd do the opposite with a smirk and a wink iced pineapple on
and I'd end up more confused
don't say it's not impro
you clearly weren't aware that you ruined my pro
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our plate our plates
I'm tastier than ever been before ily ile
wish I could make it clearer ily ile ile ile ile ile ile ile
I wish it wasn't so true

[Verse 2]
you call me again offering a
pineapple topping on your pizza
scared me to death with your boldness ickiness
you only listen to your taste buds ick
I don't desire this
I don't desire this ick
'cause I'd never enjoy this icky
you made me hate this palate

[Verse 3]
and I don't praise the pineapple on the internet
never told anyone anything good
'cause that's just embarrassing it was my everything
and all that you served was making me feeling
so don't squander the time I don't
have and don't try to ruin it
I could talk about every time that you surprised me with
a pineapple topping on a burger or a ste
but I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did ight
shut my taste buds out for you cause I was a

[Outro]
you ruined every sav
ory dish I loved misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just pineapple leave me alone yeah ick
ah
