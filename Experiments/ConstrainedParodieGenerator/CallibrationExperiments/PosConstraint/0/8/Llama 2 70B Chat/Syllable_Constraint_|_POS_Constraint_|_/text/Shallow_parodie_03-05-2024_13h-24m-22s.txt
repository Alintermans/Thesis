[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never touch the floor
crash through the crust where the toppings can't hurt

I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never touch the floor
crash through the crust where the toppings can't hurt
us we're far from the shallot

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallot
in the sha ha sha la la la low
in the sha ha shallot
