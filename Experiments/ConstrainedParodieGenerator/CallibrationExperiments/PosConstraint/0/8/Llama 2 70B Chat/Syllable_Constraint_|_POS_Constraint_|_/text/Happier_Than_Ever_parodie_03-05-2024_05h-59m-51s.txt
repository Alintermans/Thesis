[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain it clear
it doesn't belong there

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to collect my thought before I
start to rant about this ab
horrent topping that they dare
to call a pizza topping
do you read the menu or do
you just wing it and hope for the
best when it comes to toppings
because when you said you were hungry I assumed
you meant for real food not some gimmick with
a fruit that doesn't belong on a pie you made me question my taste
buds and my sanity and
I end up feeling quite ir
rate so please don't pretend to care about my pal
ate when you clearly don't know

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain it clear it doesn't bel
ong there wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't true
mm mm who thought this was a

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask me to meet
you at the pizza joint down the street
I get there and you're ordering for me a
pineapple pizza I start to sweat you
scare me to death but I'm was
ting my breath cause you only list
en to your stomach and not to
my pleas I don't relate

[Verse 3]
to a pizza that's been desecrated with a fruit that
doesn't belong I'd never treat my taste
buds this poorly you made me hate this topping and
I don't talk shit about you on the in
ternet never told anyone any
thing bad cause that's just sad so don't
waste the time I don't have and don't try to make me feel
bad I could talk about every time that you showed
up with a pineapple pizza but I'd have an empty
line cause you never did never paid any

[Outro]
you ruined pizza night broke
all the rules of toppings and now it
just ain't right always said
you were misunderstood made all my mo
ments
your own
just
leave me
alone
