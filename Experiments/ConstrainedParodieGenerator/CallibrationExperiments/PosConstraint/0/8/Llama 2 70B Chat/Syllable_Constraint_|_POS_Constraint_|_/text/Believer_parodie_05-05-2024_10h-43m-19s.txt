[Verse 1]
first things first
I got a message that's burning in me
I'm fired up and tired of
the way that pizza's been treated
the way that pizza's been treated

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you tell me what you think that I should eat
I'm the one who knows what
I want on my pie that's neat oh oh
the master of my taste buds oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was hungry from a young age
taking my cravings to the kitchen
cooking up my dreams for the few
that look at me took to me shook at me feeling me
singing from heartache from the che
taking my message from the o
speaking my lesson from the brain
seeing the beauty through the to

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer a bel
pizza you break me down you build me
up a believer a
pizza oh let the toppings fly oh let them
rain my stomach my love my drive it
came from pizza you made me a you
made me a believer

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the ones up above
all the hate that you've heard
has turned your stomach to a dove oh oh
your stomach up above oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was choking in the crowd
building my hunger up in the
cloud falling like crumbs to the ground
hoping my cravings they would brown
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited till it broke open and rained down
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer a bel
pizza you break me down you build me
up a believer a
pizza oh let the toppings fly oh let them
rain my stomach my love my drive it
came from pizza you made me a you
made me a believer

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the oven and the heat
you're the face of the future
the sauce in my veins oh oh
the sauce in my veins oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited till it broke open and rained down
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer a bel
pizza you break me down you build me
up a believer a
pizza oh let the toppings fly oh let them
rain my stomach my love my drive it
came from pizza you made me a you
made me a believer
