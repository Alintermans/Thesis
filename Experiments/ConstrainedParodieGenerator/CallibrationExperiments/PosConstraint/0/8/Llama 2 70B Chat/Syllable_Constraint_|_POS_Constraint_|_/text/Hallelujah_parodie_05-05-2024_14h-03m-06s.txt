[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a crime having pineapple
on a beautiful pie that's just
a perfect combination of
sauce cheese and toppings all in harmony oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness and a
unique flavor to the dish but
to me it's just a culinary abom
ination that just doesn't fit
it's like putting ketchup on a ste
ak or mayonnaise on a pizza crust no

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 3]
you may think me crazy for this
stance but to me it's just common
sense that pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza it's like a crime against human
ity and an insult to the
pizza gods up above oh hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 4]
I know I'm not alone in this
fight and that many share my plight to
keep pineapple off pizza for all time so
let's raise our voices and make
our stand and never let this
abomination take hold in our land

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
hallelujah halleluj

[Additional Lyrics]
I've heard some people say that
it's a matter of personal
preference but to me it's just a sin to
put pineapple on a pizza that's just
like putting peanut butter on
a chocolate cake oh hallelujah hallelu

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time when pizza was
pure and untainted by this fruit
but now it's become a trendy topping that
some people just can't get enough
of but to me it's just a sign
of the decline of our society oh

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe someday we'll find a
cure for this pineapple disease
and pizza will once again be free from this
abomination that plagues our land
but until then we'll keep on fighting
for the purity of pizza oh hallelu
