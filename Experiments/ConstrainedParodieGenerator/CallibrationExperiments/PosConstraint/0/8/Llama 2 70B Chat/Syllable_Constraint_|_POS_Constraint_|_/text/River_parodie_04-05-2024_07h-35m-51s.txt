[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolhardy fan of
pineapple on my pizza
but now I see the error of my ways like a liar or
a thief in the night I've been a lover of pizza with
pineapple but now I know it
s just not right all my sins need a pizza that
s free from pineapple

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've been a pizza purist for years on end
but then I fell for the trend of
putting pineapple on top like a
suicide bomber on a mission from god but
now I see the mistake that I made like a che
ater in a game I've been a lover
of pineapple on my pizza but now I know it's just
a shame so let the pizza be free from the pineapple's tyranny
like a river running wild
and free let the pizza be pure and untainted by the
fruit that doesn't belong pineapple on pizza
is a sin it's a crime it's a culinary abom
ination and I won't be
a part of it no more I'll take a stand and make a
change like a river that's found its true course let the pizza be free
from the pineapple's grasp like a bird set free
from its cage let the pizza soar to new

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolhardy fan of
pineapple on my pizza

s just not right all my sins need a pizza that
s free from pineapple

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to think that pineapple on top
was the bomb like a nuclear explosion but
now I see the destruction it brings to the
pizza community like a meteor
crashing to earth I've been a lover of pineapple
on my pizza but now I know it's time to make a
change like a river that's found its true course let the pizza
be free from the pineapple's grasp like a bird set free from its cage let the
pizza soar to new heights without the weight of the pineapple holding
it down pineapple on pizza is a
