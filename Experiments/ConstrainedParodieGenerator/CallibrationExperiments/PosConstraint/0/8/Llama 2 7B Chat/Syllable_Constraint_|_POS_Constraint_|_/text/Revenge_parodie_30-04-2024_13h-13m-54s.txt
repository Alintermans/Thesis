[Intro]
I think I've finally found a way
to explain why pineapple doesn
should never be on a pizza in
any way possible please
you agree

[Verse]
I've tasted the sweetest of to
the juiciest of fruits and the crunchiest of croutons too
but when it comes to pineapple on
a pizza just can't be beatin' a drum
it's like tryin' to put ketchup
on a taco or a hot dog in a bowl of chili
just can't make It right you know what I
mean it's just pineapple and pizza don't mix like peanut
butter and jelly or mac and
cheese it's just not meant to be like they say in hawaii
when in rome do as the romans do
but when it comes to pineapple on a pie
I'll stick to my mozzarella
and my pepperoni thank you very much so please don
don't even think about puttin' it
on a pizza or I'll be in my grave before you know it

[Chorus]
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rototo
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rototo
in my grave I'll rot

[Outro]
in my grave I'll rot
I'll rot I'll rot I'll rot
is my pain your freedom
is all of my pain your freedom
