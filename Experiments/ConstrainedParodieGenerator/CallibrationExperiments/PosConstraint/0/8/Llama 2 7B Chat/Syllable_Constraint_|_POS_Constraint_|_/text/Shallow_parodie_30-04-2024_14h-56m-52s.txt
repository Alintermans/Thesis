[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza should not be the thing to do
it's a crime against
good taste and tradition too oh no

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
we're falling
in the pit of pineapple despair we are
longing
for a topping that doesn't make us

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tired of the sweet
tired of the heat wave can't you see
pineapple on a
pizza is a sin to me oh please oh

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
we're falling
in the pit of pineapple despair we are
longing
for a topping that doesn't make us

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the floor
pineapple on a pizza is a sin to
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the ha ha ha ha ha
in the ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
in the ha ha ha ha ha
we're far from the pineapple

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ha ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the floor
pineapple on a pizza is a sin to
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the ha ha ha ha
in the ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
we're far from the pineapp
we're far from the pineapple
