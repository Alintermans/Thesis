[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is a crime scene
can't believe it's not a
sign of the times we live in ins
ain't nobody got time for that fruit on a
it's like they forgot the bas
rules of pizza toppings du

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza ways
stuck in this topping cycle forever
why do we always add
the same old toppings again and ag
ain't it time for something new and exc
different on our

[Chorus]
stop your crying pineapple it's a pizza
it's not a tropical island
it's a pie not a fruit salad
we gotta get away from this topping
we gotta get away from this
stop your crying pineapple it

[Verse 2]
just when we think we're making progress on to
pineapple on a pizza
it rears its ugly head once
more and we're right back where we started ins
ain't it time to move on
from this outdated topping

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza ways
stuck in this topping cycle forever
why do we always add
the same old toppings again and ag
ain't it time for something new and exc
different on our

[Chorus]
stop your crying pineapple it's a pizza
it's not a tropical island
it's a pie not a fruit salad
we gotta get away from this topping mad
we gotta get away from this
stop your crying pineapple it

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza ways
stuck in this topping cycle forever
why do we always add
the same old toppings again and ag
ain't it time for something new and exc
different on our

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
about pizza to
we should open up a
conversation and
learn from each other
before it's all too

[Outro]
stop your crying pineapple it's a pizza no
it's not a fruit it's a
piece of art we gotta get away from this to
topping nightmare we gotta get away from this
topping nightmare we gotta get
away from this topping nightmare
we gotta get away from this
