[Verse 1]
just a pineapple on a pizza town girl liv
she took the midnight train goin' anywhere
just a pizza topping born and raised in hawai
it's sweet and juicy goin' anywhere go

[Verse 2]
a pineapple in a pizza
smell of tropical paradise
for a flavor they can share the
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the menu board
their tastebuds searchin' in the
flavor profiles
livin' just to find the perfect
topping somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get the right
everybody wants a slice
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more to

[Verse 4]
some will cheese the pizza
some will pepperoni the
oh the toppings never end
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the menu board
their tastebuds searchin' in the
flavor profiles
livin' just to find the perfect
topping somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop savorin
hold on to that flavor
menu options
don't stop savorin
hold on
menu options
don't stop savorin
hold on to that flavor
menu options
