[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
it's a crime against human
I can't believe you'd even
try to put it on a

[Verse 1]
give me a break or two to think of a reasonwhy
pineapple doesn't belong
on a pizza it's just not
the flavor or the texture
it's like trying to mix oil and
water it just don't work out
you can't just throw something
on a pizza without a care in the worldand
expect it to taste good it's like you're la
playing a trick on your taste budsand me I'm not falling for itno
pineapple on a pizza
it's just not worth the riskof
ruining a perfectly good pie with a fruit that
just doesn't belong no matter

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie no it's a crime against
humanity please don't do it it's just not right
it's like putting ketchup on a hot dog it's just not natural
it's like putting mayonnaise

[Verse 2]
you can have your pepperoni and
your mushrooms and your olives toobut
pineapple is a no go it's like a red
flag waving in the face of good tasteit

pizza it's like trying to put
jelly on a peanut butter
sandwich it just don't work

I know some people might say it's an acquired taste but
I'm sorry I just can't agree it
tastes like a fruit that's been left in the sun too long
it's like a tropical nightmare on a pie
it's just not worth the risk of ruining
a perfectly good pizza with a
fruit that doesn't belong no matter how hard you try to make
it taste good it's just not gonna happen no matter
how you slice it no pun intendedpineapple on a pie
it's just not worth the risk of ruining a

[Outro]

no go it's just not worth the
risk of ruining a perfectly good
pie
