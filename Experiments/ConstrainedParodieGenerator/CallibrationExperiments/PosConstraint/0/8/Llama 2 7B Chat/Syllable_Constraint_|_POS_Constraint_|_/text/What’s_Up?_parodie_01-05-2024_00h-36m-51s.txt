[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
oh no no no no no no no no no no
it's a crime against cul
I can't even begin to explain
the horror I would feel inside if I had to eat
that sweet and savory

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I i am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my voice
what is wrong with

[Chorus]
and I say pineapple
pineapple
I said pineapple what's going
on a pizza go on
pineapple
I said pineapple what's going

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh oh u
oh oh
oh
oh oh u

[Verse 2]
I try to
oh my goodness do I
I try to avoid
this abomination
at all costs
I pray every day
for a pizza without the fruit
of paradise lost

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I i am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my voice
what is wrong with

[Chorus]
and I say pineapple
pineapple
I said pineapple what's gone
on a pizza go on
pineapple
I said pineapple what's gone on
and I say pineapple
oh no no no no no no no no
pineapple
go away go away go away
go away
go away go away goaway
go away go away
go away go away go away
go away goaway
go away go away go away
go away
go away go away goaway

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh oh u

[Outro]
twenty five years and my life
still trying to get up that great big hill of
hope for a destination
