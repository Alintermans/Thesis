[Verse 1]
pineapple
oh no don't put it on my pizza
it's a crime against culina
I can't believe you'd even
consider such a travesty

[Verse 2]
secondary to
the cheese and the sauce and the pepperoni too
but pineapple has no
place on a pizza in my book oh
it's just not crunchy enough for

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet of
authenticity and tradition
but pineapple on a pizza
just doesn't cut the mustard in my opinion oh
no no no no no no no no
let's keep it classic and true oh
keep it real for me and you oh
make it pizza perfection oh

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no no
don't put it on a
pizza please oh please oh please oh please
keep it classic and true
real for me and you oh oh oh oh oh oh
make it pizza perfection oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 3]
thirdly and
for those who dare to be different
go ahead and add some
anchovies or artichokes or even
clams but pineapple no way oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet
of authenticity and trad
but pineapple on a pizza
just doesn't cut the mustard in
my opinion oh no no no no no no no no
let's keep it classic and true oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
make it pizza

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no no

pizza please oh please oh please oh please

real for me and you oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 4]
lastly and
for those who enjoy the sweet and savour
pineapple on their pizza
go ahead and indulge in
your delicious delight oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet of authenticity
and tradition but pineapple on a pizza no no no
just doesn't cut
