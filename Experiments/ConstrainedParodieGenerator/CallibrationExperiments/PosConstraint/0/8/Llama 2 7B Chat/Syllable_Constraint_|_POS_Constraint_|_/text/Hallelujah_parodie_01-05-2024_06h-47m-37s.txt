[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should not
be a topping that you would choose to
it's a flavor that just doesn't belong oh no
it's like a choir singing a
discordant hallelujah in
the key of cheese and sauce and pepperoni

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on a pizza is

[Verse 2]
you may think it's exotic and new
but trust me it's just not true oh
it's like a hawaiian vacation in a
pizza box that just won't do
and don't even get me started
on the cheese sticking to the roof of your mouth

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on a pizza is

[Verse 3]
it's a taste that just doesn't mesh
with the rest of the toppings on
the flavors just don't blend oh no it's like
a cacophony of flavors that just
don't belong in harmony
like a hallelujah that's not quite right oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on a pizza is

[Verse 4]
so let's all agree to disag
and leave the pineapple for the plate
where it can be the star of the show oh yes
and not on a pizza where it
will just be a hallelujah
no no no no no no no no no no no

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on a pizza is
hallelujah hallelujah
no no no no no no no no
hallelujah hallelujah
no no no no no no no no
hallelujah hallelujah
no no no no no no no no
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
hallelujah halleluj

[Additional Lyrics]
it's like a tropical storm
in the middle of a pizza
and don't even get me started on the
mushrooms they just don't go oh no oh
and the pepperoni it's just
a flavor that don't belong oh no oh no

[Additional Lyrics]
it's like a symphony of flav
but the pineapple just don't
play the right note oh no oh no oh no oh
and don't even get me started
on the anchovies they're just too
much too much for me oh no oh no oh no oh

[Additional Lyrics]
it's like a rainbow in the
middle of a pizza but the
pineapple just don't go oh no oh no
it's like a sunburn on a sunday oh
no no no no no no no no no
hallelujah hallelujah no no no no
