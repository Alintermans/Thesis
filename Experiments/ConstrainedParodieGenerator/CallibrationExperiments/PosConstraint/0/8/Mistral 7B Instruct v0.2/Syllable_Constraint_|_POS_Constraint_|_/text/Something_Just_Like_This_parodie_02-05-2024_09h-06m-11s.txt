[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
pepperoni and its
pineapple doesn't
belong on a pizza
and clearly I don't see myself in that kitchen

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said eat what you love and
take that culinary
I'm not looking for a pie with
an unusual topping
some exotic fruit
a tropical del
just something I can enjoy
somebody I can tell
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pizza with its many
toppings in the pantry
pineapple doesn't fit
the savory blend it
and I'm not the kind of person that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said eat what you crave and take
that bold approach to life
I'm not looking for a pie with
an unexpected taste bud
some tropical fruit
a tropical twist
just something I can enjoy
somebody I can miss

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pie with
an unusual topping
some tropical fruit
a tropical twist
just something I can enjoy
somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
