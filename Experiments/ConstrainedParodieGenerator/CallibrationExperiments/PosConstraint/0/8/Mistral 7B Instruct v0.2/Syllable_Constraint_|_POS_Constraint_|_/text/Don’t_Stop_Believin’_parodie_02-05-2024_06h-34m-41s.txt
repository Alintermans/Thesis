[Verse 1]
just a small town cookin' up a curious dish
pineapple on a pizza causing quite a
a city palate with a taste so bold and new
but oh the debate goes on and on and on

[Verse 2]
a chef in the kitchen with a
pineapple's sweet aroma in
for a bite they can share the meal
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
waitin' in the lines so long
their palates searching for delight
toppings choices
living just to find acceptance
hiding in the pizza night

[Verse 3]
struggling to create a
pineapple on a pizza
paying any price to change the taste
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will love it pure and
some will curse the pineapple
oh the pizza war never
ends it goes on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
waitin' in the lines so long
their palates searching for delight
toppings choices
living just to find acceptance
hiding in the pizza night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
