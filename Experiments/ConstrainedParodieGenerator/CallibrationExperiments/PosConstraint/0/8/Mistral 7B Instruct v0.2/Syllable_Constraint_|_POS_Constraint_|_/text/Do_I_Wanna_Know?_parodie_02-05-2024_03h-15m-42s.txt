[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clashes like something
in the kitchen cabinet so
have you no idea that it's a big
mistake I've seen you make this weeknight after nightlight
how many food combinations
can you justify
'cause there's this joke I found that makes me think of you somehow an' I
replay it in my head until I fall asleep

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this combination flows
was sorta hopin' that you'd stick to the classics and
baby we both know that the pizzas were mainly
made for taste combinations that you can't enjoy

[Chorus]
slicing back to you
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
committed to the
toppings that are new now I
have thought it through slic
ing back to you slic

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been wondering if your palate's still
open wide and if so I wanna know what
toppings it's open for tonight simmer down an' take a
bite I'm sorry to interrupt it's just I'm constantly on
the edge of trying to improve your pizza pie but
I don't know if you feel the same as I do

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this combination flows
was sorta hopin' that you'd stick to the classics and
baby we both know that the pizzas were mainly
made for taste combinations that you can't enjoy

[Chorus]
slicing back to you slicing back to you
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a few slicing
'cause I always do slicing slicing back
maybe I'm too busy being true to
the toppings that are me to fall
for something new slicing back
to you slicing back
to you slicing back

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this combination flows
was sorta hopin' that you'd stick to the classics and
baby we both know that the pizzas were mainly
made for taste combinations that you can't enjoy
do I wanna know too busy being true to the
toppings that are me to order something new slicing
back to you slicing back to you slicing back to you slic
