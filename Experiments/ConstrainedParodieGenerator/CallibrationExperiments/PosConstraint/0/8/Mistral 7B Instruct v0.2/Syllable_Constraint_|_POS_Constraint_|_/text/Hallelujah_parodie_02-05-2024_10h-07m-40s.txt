[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that italians made and it caused a
disagreeable fuss oh you don't really
care for taste do ya it goes like
this the first the second pineap
please don't add the fruit on top applesau

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 2]
your palate was strong but you needed
proof you saw it on the pizza
topped with ham and cheese it overthrew ya they
chopped up the pineapple and they
placed it on the cheese and sauce they tied
you to a chair and they forced you to hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 3]
you say I took the rule in vain
I don't even know the name
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a blend of flavors in every
pizza pie it doesn't matter
which topping you preferred the pineapple or

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I tried to touch
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of taste
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Outro]
hallelujah pineapple free

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this table I've walked this
floor I used to eat alone before I knew
and I've seen your flag on the pepperon
I love is not a victory
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy pepper was moving
too and every bite we drew was halleluj

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
