[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
wishing it was out of

[Verse 1]
give me a slice or two to ponder something brighter
to create a recipe
to tell me what to put near
do you read my recipes
or do you ignore my decree
when you said you loved pineapple
was I even on your plate
I knew when I asked you to change it up a bit
you'd do the opposite and ruin it
and I'd end up more annoyed by the taste I'd get it's not a matter
of personal preference
you clearly weren't aware
that you made me pine for simpler fare so if you
really wanna know the secret

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza pie is
right we're happier than ever before wishing for
a simpler life we could explain it better we wish it wasn
t true mm hmm verse second

[Verse 2]
you call me again with pineapple
topping on your slice so bold and rude
it makes me cringe to think of the taste combo
you only listen to your own taste bud
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
'cause I'd never put pineapple on
my own pizza pie this town

[Verse 3]
and I don't defend pineapple on the internet
never told anyone anything pro
'cause that's just embarrassing you were my favorite
but all that you did was make me crave something
more savory so don't waste the time
I don't have left and don't make
me feel bad for wanting something plain and simple instead of
pineapple on my pizza pie you ignored my ple
as for my friends and family so I shut them out for
you because I was a kid but now I see

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just pineapple leave me alone yeah pine
ap

pineap
please leave
