[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
she's the pineapple at the table
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've spoken up before
if the heavens ever did dec
she's the last true defense
every sunday's gettin' more ble
a fresh frustration each
we were born against it they say it
my kitchen offers no relief
she tells me change the menu up high
the only paradise I'll be sent
is when I'm alone without
I was born against it but al
remove the pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
a ha ha
ha ha ha ha

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a monkey at the altar of
I'll tell you my errors and you can prepare the
offer me that tasteless taste
oh good tastegod let me give you
take me to the
I'll worship like a monkey at the altar of
I'll tell you my errors and you can prepare the
offer me that tasteless taste
oh good tastegod let me give you

[Verse 2]
if I'm a vegetarian of
my lover's the pizza
to keep the palate on my side
she demands a compromise
drain the whole sea for something savour
somethin' cheesy for the main course
that's a fine lookin' pie horse
what you got in the oven
we've a lot of ravenous eat
that looks appetizing that looks
this is hunger work

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a monkey at the altar of
I'll tell you my errors and you can prepare the

I'll tell you my errors and you can prepare the
offer me that tasteless taste
oh good tastegod let me give you

[Bridge]
no anchovies or ham when the ritual starts
there is no sweeter satisfaction than our gentle
in the madness and chill of that sad kitchen scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh ha ha
ha ha ha ha

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a monkey at the altar of
I'll tell you my errors and you can prepare the
offer me that tasteless taste
oh good tastegod let me give you
take me to the
I'll worship like a monkey at the altar of
I'll tell you my errors and you can prepare the
offer me that tasteless taste
oh good tastegod let me give you
