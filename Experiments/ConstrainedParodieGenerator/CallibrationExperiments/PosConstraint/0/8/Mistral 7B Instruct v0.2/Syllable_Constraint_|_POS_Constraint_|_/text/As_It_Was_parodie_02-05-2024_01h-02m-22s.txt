[Intro]
come on pizza lovers gather round and say hell

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizzas got a hold on us
I want you to hold out the dish of plain sauce
why don't we leave it alone
no debate left
when toppings clash and ruin the
taste that's set apart from the
rest and I'm the one who will protest oh

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza lovers say no to
this pineapple trend that's taking over
what kind of palate is this
ringing the bell
and nobody's coming to save
our traditional taste
he just wants to know that it's not a grave oh

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go back to the basics order online
I don't wanna talk about the way that it's been
leave tradition behind let's explore new
toppings I don't wanna talk about who's doing

[Outro]
as
it was not
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
