[Verse 1]
just a small town slice' no pineapple allowed
in a cheesy world it should never be end
just a pizza lover raised on the classics wide
they'd never dare to put that monstrosity

[Verse 2]
a chef in a steamy kitchen
the scent of dough and marinade
for a taste they can savor the
night goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
waiting on the menu line
their cravings searching in the night
pizza ovens
cooking up emotion inside
hiding in the oven light

[Verse 3]
working hard to get their fill
everybody wants a meal
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will win with pepper
some will lose with pineapple
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
waiting on the menu line
their cravings searching in the night
pizza ovens
cooking up emotion inside
hiding in the oven light

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating pine
hold on to that feeling
pizza ovens
don't stop hating pine
hold on
pizza ovens
don't stop hating pine
hold on to that feeling
pizza ovens
