[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my appetite at the table
that monstrosity should not be allowed now

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet deception and my misguided taste bud
we're arguing in the kitchen like two fool
anomaly of taste buds like pieces in a
food fight I can't believe after all these

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that taste is not coming back
and I might be okay but I'm not satisfied
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it is again on that pizza slice
it's ruining the taste of every bite I take with you
pineapple on a pizza
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
toppings scattered on the counter like a messy crime scene
you used to be a fan of the classic cheese and pepperoni dream
and your roommate's telling stories of you on the pizza
team you told me about your love for pineapple and
ham but you never called it what it was till it was too late
and you were tossing me the pizza cutter like
you knew it all along and I was thinking on the
slice that this was a mistake but I took a bite any
way and I was thinking of the
time before pineapple on a pizza when
I could enjoy a slice with
cheese and tomato sauce alone and now it's ruined for
me and I wonder where it all went wrong as I reach

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there it is again in the middle of the
night we're arguing in the kitchen in the refrigerate
or light down the stairs I
remember it all too well and
there we are again when nobody had to know you
kept it like a secret but I kept it like a curse and
swore to never eat it
again yeah and I remember it

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you added pine
apple and ruined it
running scared I was there I rem
ember it all too well and you call me up again just to
break me like a promise so casually cruel in the
name of being honest I'm a crumpled up piece
of paper lying here cause I

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time I see pineapple on
a pizza I'm still trying to find a way to enjoy it again
and did the pineapple on
a pizza pain you too cause in this city
of pizza lovers I still remember the first slice of pizza I had
without pineapple and how it felt
like a delicacy I remember
it all too well and
you call me up again just to remind me
of the pain it caused me and I wonder why you
keep doing it to me over and over again I can't
take it anymore I remember it all too well and

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to enjoy pizza again but I'm still trying to find it
after pineapple days and nights when you ruined it
for me I'm still trying to enjoy it again
but it's hard to forget the taste of pineapple
on a pizza you can't get rid of it cause it
reminds you of the pain it
caused you and I remember it all

[Chorus]
cause there it is again when I loved it
back before you added pineapple and ruined it
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare you were there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at hiding my disappointment but
the truth is I can't stand pineapple on
a pizza I'd rather have it without
it's a travesty I still remember the
first time I had it with pineapple
and how it ruined the taste of every slice
I've had since then and I still
remember it all too well and I can
t believe I ever thought it
was a good idea to add

[Outro]
just between us I remember it all too well I can
t believe I ever thought it was a goodidea
to add pineapple to a pizza I remember it all too
well and I can't believe I ever
thought it was a good idea to
add pineapple to a pizza it
was a mistake I remember it all too
well and I can't believe I ever
thought it was a good idea to
add pineapple to a pizza it
was a mistake I remember
it all too well and I can't believe
I ever thought it was a goodide
a to add pineapple to a pi
zza I remember it all too
well and I can't believe I ever
thought it was a good idea to
add pineapple to a pizza it
was a mistake I remember it all too

[Spoken Outro]
I hate pineapple on
