[Intro]
come on now folks let's share our two cents on this

[Verse 1]
firmly in place
sweet cheesy goodness takes its
grace as I look at the slice in my hand say
why add fruit to this dish today
taste is bland when
ham and pineapple blend in a
messy panoply of flav
ors that just don't belong this way done

[Chorus]
in this pie it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this pie it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
dial the chef
sayin' pineapple is a
no go for a pizza worth its dough he
serves up classics that hit the
spot no need for
trendy toppings here just give me
plain cheese and tomato sauce
on a crust that's thin and baked just right and true

[Chorus]
in this pie it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this pie it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
bake it right don't add the pineapple
don't wanna talk about how it ruins the meal
stick to tradition let the tomato
sauce and cheese be the star of the show not the pineap

[Outro]
as
it was you
know it's not the same as it was as
it was as it was you
