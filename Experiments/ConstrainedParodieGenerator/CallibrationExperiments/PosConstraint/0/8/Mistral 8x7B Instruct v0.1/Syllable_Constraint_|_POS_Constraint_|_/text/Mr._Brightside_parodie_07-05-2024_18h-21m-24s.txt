[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottles in hand looking so divine start
it started out with a slice now my stomach is in a
wad of grease and cheese why did I add pineapple
now I'm falling asleep with heartburn and regret
while they're eating their pizza without any sweat
now they're full and satisfied and my stomach is
sick and it's all in what

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savoring each bite
it tastes so right tonight
let me go
and I just can't look it's ruining
my appetite so

[Chorus]
jealousy turning paupers into kings
enjoying every bite
it's just the price I pay for
my pizza faux pas tonight
destiny is calling me
to open up my eager
eyes and realize that

[Guitar Solo]
