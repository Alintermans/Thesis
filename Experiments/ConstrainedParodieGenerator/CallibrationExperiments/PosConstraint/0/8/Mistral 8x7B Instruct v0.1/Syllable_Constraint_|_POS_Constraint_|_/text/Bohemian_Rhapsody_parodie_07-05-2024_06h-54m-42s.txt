[Intro]
is this a bad pie coming from pure deceit
pineapple on pizza making us all take a seat
look at this monstrosity served upon your
plate and plate and plate again and again it
comes and comes and comes and comes and comes again and again and
again it's just a crime against good taste and reason any way

[Verse 1]
hammered by this notion
sweet and tangy fruit should not be on a pizza option
hammered by this decision
to put it on a dish I hold so dear
oh my heart is filled with pure emotion
if I have to see it again tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my hunger has
come and now I've tasted this abomination and
goodbye to all I held so true and dear
gotta leave behind this monstrosity and
oh my heart is filled with pure despair
I sometimes wish I'd just
stayed away and never tried it anywhere

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little piece of pineapple on
a pizza slice and it makes me want to run and hide
thunderbolt and lightning never thought I'd see the day when
sweet and savory would be combined in such a way oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no
it's just a crime against humanity and
it's just a poor excuse for a pizza pie
spare me this monstrosity and let me
enjoy my pizza the way it was always
meant to be with just cheese and tomato
and maybe some pepperoni or sausage too
but never ever ever ever pineapple
let it go let it go let it
go will not let it go will not
let it go never never never never let
it go no no no no no
no pineapple on my pizza pie oh mamma mia let it
go beelzebub has a special place in hell for you and your pine

[Verse 4]
so you think you can fool me with your sweet disgu
e but I see through your lies and I won't be
fooled again oh baby can't do this to
me baby just gotta get out just gotta get right

[Outro]
out
away from this
crime against humanity and reason and
taste and tradition and
all that is good and right in this
world any way the wind
