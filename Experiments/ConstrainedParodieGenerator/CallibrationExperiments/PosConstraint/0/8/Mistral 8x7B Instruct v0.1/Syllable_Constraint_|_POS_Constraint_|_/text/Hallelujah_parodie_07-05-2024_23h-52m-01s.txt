[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for that do ya pov
it goes like this the dough the sauce
the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the baffling sight of pineapple shows

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 2]
your taste was fine but you needed proof
you tried it once and it ruined
your appetite with its sweet rebuffing truth
it clashed with ham and tomato
and left a bitter aftertaste so
you vowed to nevermore pineapple include

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 3]
you say it's just a fruit on bread
but it's a sacrilege instead
I don't even know what you were thinking
but if I did I'd say it's quite absurd
to put pineapple on pizza
it's just not something that should be sinking in

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 4]
I tried it once it wasn't much
it left a bad taste in my mouth so
I vowed to nevermore pineapple include
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the pizza gods
with nothing on my slice but disapproval

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Outro]
pineapple no no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I've walked this floor
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pineapple on the mar
gherita arch love is not a
victory march it's a cold and it's a broken

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy pizza was moving
too and every bite we drew was pineapple

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot down someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken pineapple taste
