[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies now are falling like the rain so
let the river run juice

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with a slice looking to fe
sweet jackets and dress slacks mismatched
on his breath's pineapple he's a mess
and she just wants to protest and arrest this trend
it's a fight she's on a mission to contest and
he can't understand why pineapple
should not be on a pizza he insists it's a win win
but she's devised a plan to stop him in his tracks knife in hand she says
their relationship's hanging
by a thread she's been on the web lately says maybe she
will start a petition to get pineapple banned
and I know she's using me to try to win this debate
I don't care hI suzanne but
I should have said bye suzanne after the first bite but
tonight I am proclaiming loud and clear that pineapple does not
belong on a pizza so let the river
run juice juice juice and wash away this sin

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies now are falling like the rain so
let the river run juice

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand it
was come morning time scram now we hug tight and yet
he still can't understand why pineapple
should not be on a pizza it's absurd he
says but she's determined to make him see the light and
show him the error of his ways so she takes him to
a pizza place that serves classic pizza pies and orders
a plain cheese pizza and shows him how delicious it can be without pine
apple and he starts to see the light and realizes that he's been
wrong all along and apologizes
for ever thinking that pineapple belonged on a
pizza and they live happily ever after so let the
river run juice juice juice and wash away this
sin of putting pineapple on a once
perfect pizza so let the river
run juice juice juice and wash away this sin juice juice
juice and wash away this sin juice juice juice
juice and wash away this
sin juice juice juice and wash away this sin juice
juice juice juice and wash away this sin juice juice juice juice and wash
aw

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies now are falling like the rain so
let the river run juice

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's juice my name's juice
river
ju
ce juice juice
and let the river run
call me juice we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the joker saying pineapple
on pizza's fine but now I see the light
and I'm sorry for ever thinking it was right this love
triangle left us in a mess tangled what else can
I say it was a mistake to ever
think that pineapple belonged
on a pizza so let the river run
juice juice juice and wash away this sin juice juice juice
and wash away this sin juice juice juice and wash
away this sin juice juice juice and wash
away this sin juice juice juice and wash away
this sin juice juice juice and wash away this sin

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
's gonna cause is pain the truth and
my lies now are falling like the rain so let the
river run juice juice juice
