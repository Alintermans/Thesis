[Intro]
I think I've had my fill now of that
pineapple on a pizza trap
can't pretend it's gourmet fare at
last I see the error of
my ways oh

[Verse]
I've tasted sweet success before
with cheese and pepperoni galore óréo forevermore
oh man what a dish that I ignore
if I could turn away from pineapple core
some love it some despise it some
admit it's just not meant to be combined with ham and dough
so break the cycle break the trend don't
insist on putting pineapple in my hand I'll pass it on
I've tasted sweet success before
with cheese and pepperoni galore óréo forevermore
oh man what a dish that I ignore
if I could turn away from pineapple core
some love it some despise it some
admit it's just not meant to be combined with ham and dough
so break the cycle break the trend don't
insist on putting pineapple in my hand I'll pass it on

[Chorus]
I'll pass it on pass
it on pass it on
I'll pass it on pass it on
pass it on pass it
on pass it on pass it on
I'll pass it on pass

[Outro]
I'll pass it on pass
it on pass it on is
my disgust your pleasure
is all of my displeasure your
pleasure
