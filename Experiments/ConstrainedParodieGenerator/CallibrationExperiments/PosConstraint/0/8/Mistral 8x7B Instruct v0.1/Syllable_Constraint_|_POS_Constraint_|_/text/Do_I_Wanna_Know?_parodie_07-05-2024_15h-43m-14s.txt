[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple a treat
on your pizza pie so sweet and neatly meted out in
slivers arranged in a circular neat
do you think it belongs in a
cuisine so revered by many a food
connoisseur who'd never dare to pollute it with fruit
then let me tell you all about

now I've thought it through

should pineapple be on a pizza slice or not
is it a culinary sin or just a thoughtless
addition to a classic dish that's already
been perfected without the need for any sweet spot
should pineapple be on a pizza slice or not ort
o is it a culinary sin or just a thought
less addition to a classic dish that's already been
