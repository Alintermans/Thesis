[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I realized quickly when I took a bite
that pineapple's a culprit that just doesn't fit right
it's a mistake I can

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I see it on the
pizza that I'm going to devour
and I feel a little peculiar and soi take
a bite and I spit it out with power and flower
and I shout from the bottom of my heart full
of regret and disappointment at
the top of lung

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on with
this pizza today hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on with

[Bridge]
oh no
oh
oh no no
oh no
oh
oh no no

[Verse 2]
and I tried
my god did I try to
enjoy pineapple
on my pizza plate fate
and I pray
my god did I pray to
enjoy the taste of pineapple
on my pizza plate

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I see it on the
pizza that I'm going to devour
and I feel a little peculiar and soi take
a bite and I spit it out with power and flower
and I shout from the bottom of my heart full
of regret and disappointment at
the top of lung

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on
with this pizza today
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on with
and I say hey hey hey
wake in the morning and step outside
take a deep
breath and I get real high and I scream
hey hey hey
what's going on with this pizza
and I say hey hey hey
wake in the morning and step outside
take a deep breath and
I get real high and I scream hey hey
what's going
on with this pizza today hey

[Bridge]
oh no
oh
oh no no

[Outro]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate fate
