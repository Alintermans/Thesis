[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a culinary crime
don't you think it's gross inside
it's a topping that just doesn't belong here with
the cheese and pepperoni
it's just not meant to be sir

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before with pineapple
why does it keep appearing on our
pizzas and our night
mares we've been here before with pineap
please leave it off our pizzas tonight
and forevermore out

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and listen to
me we gotta get away from
this monstrosity we gotta
get away from this monstrosity we
gotta put down that pineapple
slice and run away from this her

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and give it a
chance to be free let it go
back to the grocery store
remember it's a fruit not a pizza
topping it just doesn't fit
somewhere far away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before with pineapple
why does it keep appearing on our
pizzas and our night
mares we've been here before with pineap
please leave it off our pizzas tonight
and forevermore out

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and listen to
me we gotta get away from
this monstrosity we gotta
get away from this monstrosity we got
to put down that pineapple slice
and run away from this heres

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before with pineapple
why does it keep appearing on our
pizzas and our night
mares we've been here before with pineap
please leave it off our pizzas tonight
and forevermore out

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
about what belongs
on a pizza and what
doesn't before it
gets out of hand will
we ever learn to

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice and run away from
this disaster we got
to get away from this disaster we got to
get away from this disaster we got to get
away from this disaster we
got to get away from this her
esy disaster we got to
