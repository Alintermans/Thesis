[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go ical error
pineapple should not be there no sir
I should have added pepperron
if the heavens ever did dec
ree a pizza topping
a savory slice they'd be recomm
ending not a sweet one
we were born to eat real pie not this
monstrosity they call a dish
she tells me put pineapple on it
I'd rather eat it in the bin it
belongs in a ham and pine
apple ring not on my nine nine
I was born with good taste

[Pre-Chorus]
a mercy
mercy mercy

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie it doesn't belong here at
all I won't stand for this abomination
offer me a meat lover
s supreme instead let me enjoy
my pizza please
keep pineapple off my pizza pie it doesn't
belong here at all I won't stand for this ab
omination offer me
a meat lover's feast instead let me

[Verse 2]
if I'm a fan of savory bit
es my pizza shouldn't
have a sweet surprise on it like
that it's just not right drain the
whole can of pineapple chunks away
get something better for the main
course that's a shameful sight what
you got on that pizza pie
it looks like a monstrosity
that looks like a disaster this
is a culinar

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie it doesn't belong here at
all I won't stand for this abomination
offer me a meat lover
s supreme instead let me enjoy
my pizza please
keep pineapple off my pizza pie it doesn't
belong here at all I won't stand for this ab
omination offer me
a meat lover's feast instead let me

[Bridge]
no pineapple allowed when the feast begins none
of that sweetness contaminating my dinner plate with
its artificial sugary taste only then
I can enjoy my pizza in peace without any

[Pre-Chorus]
a mercy merc
y mercy merc

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie it doesn't belong here at
all I won't stand for this abomination
offer me a meat lover
s supreme instead let me enjoy
my pizza please
keep pineapple off my pizza pie it doesn't
belong here at all I won't stand for this ab
omination offer me
a meat lover's feast instead let me
