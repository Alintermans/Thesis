[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I'm disgusted then
wish I could explain it clearer
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a protest letter
to tell the world to steer clear
do you read my rants online
or do you skip my line of sight
when you said you'd give it a chance
were you even on my side
I knew when I asked you to try it once you would
say it's not that bad and ruin my mood
and I'd end up more annoyed for food I once pursued devices you
should've just declined and left
the pizza untouched on your
plate instead of ruining the taste with pineapple
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I'm disgusted
wish I could explain it clearer I wish it wasn't
true mm mm iced over with sweetness I despise oh so much true
it shouldn't be on a pie

[Verse 2]
you call me again asking for pine
thinking it's a good idea this
time I'm wasting my breath on you saying no
it's not a good fit for a savory
dish like pizza you just don
't get it I don't relate to
you I don't relate to you
I'd never top a pizza

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about pizza online never
told anyone anything bad about
it because that's just embarrassing it was once
my favorite food now ruined by pineap
please leave it alone leave it alone don
't waste my time with pineapple on a
pizza it's just not right I could talk about every time
that I tried it but I'd have an empty line because
it's just not worth my time and I regret it every
time I take a bite of pineapple on a

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone yeah fuck you
ah
goddam
ah
fuck you
fuck you
