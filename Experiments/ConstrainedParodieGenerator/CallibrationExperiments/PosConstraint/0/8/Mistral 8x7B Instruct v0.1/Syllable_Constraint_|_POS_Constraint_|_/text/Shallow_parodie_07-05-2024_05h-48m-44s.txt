[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something's wrong
why would pineapple belong on a
pizza treat fit for
a carnivore's feast or so it

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
it's appall
in the good times I find myself longing for
a slice
in the bad times I fear myself full

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something man
aren't you tired of this ham and pine
on a pizza plan
or do you need more sweet and sour in

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
it's a fall
in the good times I find myself longing for
a taste
in the bad times I fear myself a

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching as I dive
in disbelief at this
crime on a pizza pie they can't forgive
we're far from the delicious

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pizza shallow
in the sha pizza la la low life
in the sha pizza shallow
we're far from the edible

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ah ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching as I dive
in disbelief at this
crime on a pizza pie they can't forgive
we're far from the delicious

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pizza shame
in the sha pizza la la low life
in the sha pizza shame
we're far from the edible
