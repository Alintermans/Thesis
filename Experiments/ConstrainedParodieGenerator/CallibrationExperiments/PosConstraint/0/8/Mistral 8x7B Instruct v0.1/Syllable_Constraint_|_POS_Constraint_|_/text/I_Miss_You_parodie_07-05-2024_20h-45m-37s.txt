[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on pizza's bane and swindle
a savory dish's ruin and downfall
a culinary blunder
in the food domain reigns terr
or as I take a bite and start to grieve say
this combo's a mistake and
wish this monstrosity had never
been conceived or served today oh say it
never had occurred this

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the ham and cheese I crave so
a classic pairing that I miss so much
this sweet and tangy fruit has no
place on a pizza
it's a disgrace to all the pies out there so
take it off my plate and serve
a slice with dignity and
respect for the italian cuisine
or else I'll turn away and say
no more pineapple pizza
for me tonight oh say it never had
occurred tonight oh

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time with pineapple on me
it's not a treat but a
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time with pineapple on me
it's not a treat but a
I despise it I desp

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time with pineapple on me
it's not a treat but a
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time with pineapple on me
it's not a treat but a
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time with pineapple on me
it's not a treat but a
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time with pineapple on me
it's not a treat but a
I despise it I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
