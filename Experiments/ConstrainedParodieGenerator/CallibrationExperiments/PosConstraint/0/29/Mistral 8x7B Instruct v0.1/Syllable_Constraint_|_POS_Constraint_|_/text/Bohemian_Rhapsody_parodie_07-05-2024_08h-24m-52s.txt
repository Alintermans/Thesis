[Intro]
should I eat this pizza covered in pineap
does it belong here or is this just a fantasy
could they have gone mad to even think of this
I hear them saying it's a culinary
delight but I say no way high or low soon I'll know
any pizza topped with fruit is just so wrong to me anyway

[Verse 1]
things already looked so
good then someone added pineapples and ruined the flow
claimed it was a game changer
but once I bit fell on the floor no sav
inger rollin' in despairing over
that I may ever just truly enjoy cheese
ny after today with onions over salad more care

[Verse 2]
