[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something''
are you able to enjoy your meal
without that fruit on
does pineapple on pizza still feel

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
it tastes foul
on this savory dish im longing wanting
outside
and during every single bite

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
come on now buddy
do you really think it tastes that studdy
but listen here now
were just trying to state our viewpoint

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
it tastes foul
on this savory dish forever longing
without
or with some other savory fruit

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
its adding in an unnecessary
they have literally
cucumber if you crave a veggie instead
its giving totally off

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
that there needs ightightightight
if there pie means company ight
at least banana staysight
your beloved pineapple off

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh pityity
I promise

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
its adding in an unnecessary
they have literally
cucumber if you crave a veggie instead
its giving totally off

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
off that idea friend
outside the restaurant waitinfor
in these times lets reform
what wrongly always onto
