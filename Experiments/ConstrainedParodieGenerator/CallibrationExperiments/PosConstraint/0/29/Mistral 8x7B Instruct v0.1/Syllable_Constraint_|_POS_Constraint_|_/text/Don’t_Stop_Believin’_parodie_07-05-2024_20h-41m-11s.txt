[Verse 1]
just a regular cheese slice'slife in a
pizza parlor all alone stands pineapple
far from its homeland kept in a corner cold stare
its isle's sweet breeze something it'll never

[Verse 2]
an abject topping behind glass
some cheapo at counter orders
without an informed thoughtless paid
its ending near and without a chance

[Pre-Chorus]
hungry people
stabbin and forkin all sides
they yearn love's forbidden taste shame
yellowed fruit
deepestest regret ever known
leftsighs to never be the

[Verse 3]
kickerin' emselfeaten
fear must every pizza
place to share its damned fate endlessly
nevermore one

[Verse 4]
these ruined wedges a
these tossed canined outreeg
it's time once do understand
my beloved forbidden fruit upon

[Pre-Chorus]
hungry people
stabbin and forkin all sides
they yearn love's forbidden taste shame
yellowed fruit
deepestest regret ever known
leftsighs to never be the

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]

is on to that flavor
nevar fruitin
keep never believes o
have on
stop likable
keep ever avoidine
is onto that flavor
nevar unsalt
