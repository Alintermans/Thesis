[Verse]
stepgin' out of the kitchen and I made quite the mess
wantin' a snack but now I regret this excess
what began out as a good idea took a fell swo
what am I to do with this pineapple left on
now my tastebuds are sour and stomach feels
on pizza it doesn't belong anyone can
there I bit in' to it and it ruined my fe
and it seems so absurd

[Pre-Chorus]
but my willpower weakens
my willpower depletes
replace it
or it's affecting my appetite it
or gets'ting icky

[Chorus]
tis wastebin' calls that which fits icky
pitifullier to over
chewdoner to over it
and its icky icky the
sightlines must battle ick
remove icky icky ick
that's called sensible

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
stepgin' out of the kitchen and I made quite the messxed
