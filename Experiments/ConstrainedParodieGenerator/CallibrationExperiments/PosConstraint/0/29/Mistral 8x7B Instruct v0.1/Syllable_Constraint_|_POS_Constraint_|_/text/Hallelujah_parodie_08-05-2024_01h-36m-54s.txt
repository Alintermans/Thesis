[Verse 1]
now I hear told the banned ananas
no fancy thought should grace our pan
but your mind's so bland about the cuisine is it
it woulda tasted great if you
had given pineapple a chance
the heated slice becomes adulates ya

[Chorus]
oh no on pizza halleluj
oh no on pizza hallel

[Verse 2]
you order straight italian and you
he thinks me expecting onion
it's that sweet bite that I pursue ór fixes
it tops my pie both ham and beef
your closed it mind or your gone yourself
and that I adore it isn't politics

[Chorus]
oh no on pizza halleluj
oh no on pizza hallel

[Verse 3]
your heated words could never sway
your closed down nope go another
but in your might still not my be my ór say
a helping an budges in debate on
what gets first serve the ór is banned
a sweeteninhslice nor no wrong way ta judge

[Chorus]
oh no on pizza halleluj
oh no on pizza hallel
