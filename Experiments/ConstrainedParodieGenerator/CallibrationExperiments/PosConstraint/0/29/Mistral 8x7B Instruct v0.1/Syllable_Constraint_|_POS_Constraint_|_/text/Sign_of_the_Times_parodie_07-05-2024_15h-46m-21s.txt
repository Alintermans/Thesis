[Verse 1]
just hold your tongue, it's a food ab
ominated sinfully
your tastebuds will regret it
they screamed so loud this shameful plight they cried out no
it breaks all harmony dist
orts the classic recipe

[Pre-Chorus]
our taste has gone astray denied
how could you possibly ruin pizza
with pineapple a trav
our taste has gone astray
when will we learn to leave the pineapple
some dishes the bold should

[Chorus]
just stay your serving it is an act against
your willed eternal hunger now
your forced internalized yearning
why add pineapple our shared calling
our trusted heirloom out the
our sacred sacred pizza

[Verse 2]
just stay your rolling won't someone forbid
letting that sweet thing get pa
sure does not equal in taste
wonky sick begged warning true italian
our respected loved long
never quite together in

[Pre-Chorus]
our taste has gone astray denied
how could you possibly ruin pizza
with pineapple a trav
our taste has gone astray
when will we learn to leave the pineapple
some dishes the bold should

[Chorus]
just stay their talking their heated a crime of
our trusted authentic shared
our beloved italialian
are you looking confusion our ire
our trusted our from the
our respected united

[Pre-Chorus]
our taste has gone astray denied
how could you possibly ruin pizza
with pineapple a trav
our taste has gone astray
when will we learn to leave the pineapple
some dishes the bold should

[Bridge]
