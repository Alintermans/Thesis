[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
my taste buds scream in horror
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just should not be

[Verse 1]
let me ponder for a while and find a clever line
to write a little ditty
to tell you what to doo do
do you taste my recipes
or ignore my culinary
when I say it shouldn't be
do you even listen to
me asking you to understand me oh so well
you do the opposite of what you said
and add it to my pizza shell oh no no no no no no no no
it shouldn't be this hard to
explain it rationally
it's just not meant to be on my plate it's true true true
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I'm in despair
wish I could explain it better but it just shouldn't
be there oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
my taste buds scream in horror

[Verse 2]
you call me up and say you're bringing
pizza with pineapple on it shame
you scared me to death but I'm wasting my breath
'cause you just don't seem to care about the
flavor game oh no no no
I don't want to relate to
that monstrosity no no no
'cause I'd never treat my pizza

[Verse 3]
and I don't defend pineapple on my posts online
never told anyone anything good
'cause that'd be embarrassing it's not understood
so don't waste my time defending it please
and don't try to make me see it your
way oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I could talk about the benefits of other toppings all
day but I'd have an empty plate if I added pine
never paid any mind to my taste preferences so
ignore it and let me enjoy my slice in

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
treating pineapple like it should be
allowed on pizza oh no
just leave my pizza alone oh oh oh
oh
oh no
oh
oh no
oh no
