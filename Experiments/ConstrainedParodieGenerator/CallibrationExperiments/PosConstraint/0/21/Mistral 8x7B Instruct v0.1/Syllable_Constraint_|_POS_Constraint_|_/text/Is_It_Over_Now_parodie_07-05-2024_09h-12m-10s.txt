[Intro]
should pineapple belong on a pizza

[Verse 1]
when the box is delivered
with the cheese and tomato sauce
an anomaly appeared
the sweet and savour

[Pre-Chorus]
fast forward to three hundred slices later oughughough
I see the pineapple and I frown in disgust oughughough
it doesn't belong with the pepperoni or sausage ough
it's a disgrace to the pizza's fame and cause oughoughoughoughough

[Chorus]
was it right when they added pineapple on
is it still wrong now that it's on the menu
I say no to pineapple on
it's a sin to put it on pizza
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
should pineapple belong

[Verse 2]
when you bite in your pizza
with the pineapple on
you taste the sweet and sour
it just doesn't belong

[Bridge]
and did you think it was okay ough
there were complaints and
at least I had the dignity
to keep it off my pizza
only rumors about my pizza
and my satisfied
oh lord I don't
jump off of very tall things
just to avoid the pineap
and say the one thing I want to say but no

[Pre-Chorus]
fast forward to three hundred awkward blind slices later ough
if it's got pineapple on it I will surmise that you'll probably hate
you dream of a pizza without the pineapple on it oughough
you search for a pizza without it for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when they added pineapple
is it still wrong now that it's on the menu
I say no to pineapple on
it's a sin to put it on pizza
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
should pine
should pineapple belong
on a
pizza pizza

[Bridge]
think it was okay ough
there were complaints and
at least I had the dignity
to keep it off my pizza
only rumors about my pizza
and my satisfied
oh lord I don't oughoughough
jump off of very tall things
just to avoid the pineapple ough
and say the one thing I want to say but no

[Outro]
should pineapple belong
should pineapple belong on a pizza pizza pizza ough
was it over then and is it over
should pineapple belong on
pizza pizza pizza
was it
was it over then and is it over now ough
