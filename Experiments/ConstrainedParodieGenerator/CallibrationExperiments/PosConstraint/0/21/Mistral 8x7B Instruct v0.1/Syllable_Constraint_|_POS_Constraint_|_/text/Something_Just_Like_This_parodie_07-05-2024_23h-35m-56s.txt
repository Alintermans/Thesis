[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the trends
anchovies and
pepperoni and am
examining the
ingredients I add
but clearly I don't see pineapple on that list

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said cheese and tomato
is that too bland to risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some unexpected twist
some exotic fruit
on top of my dish
just give me something simple
that I can truly miss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doopineappledoopine
adoopineapled
doopineapledoopine
oh I want something just like this
doopineapledoopine
adoopineapled
doopineapledoopine
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the trends
the combinations they
all recommend but pine
apple on a pizza
is not one I intend
I'm not the kind of person that enjoys that

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where do you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some unexpected twist
some exotic fruit
on top of my dish
just give me something simple
that I can truly miss

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doopineapledoopine
adoopineapled
doopineapledoopine
oh I want something just like this
doopineapledoopine
adoopineapled
doopineapledoopine

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where do you wanna
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some unexpected twist
some exotic fruit
on top of my dish
just give me something simple
that I can truly miss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
