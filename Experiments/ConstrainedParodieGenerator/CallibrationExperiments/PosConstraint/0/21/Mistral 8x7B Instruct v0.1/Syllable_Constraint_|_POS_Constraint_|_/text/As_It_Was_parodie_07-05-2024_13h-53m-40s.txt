[Intro]
come on folks, it's time to speak the truth

[Verse 1]
holdin'
pineapple's holdin'
its taste overpowers the rest of the fe
ast won't you just let it be
nothing to add
when taste gets overshadowed
on pizza it should never
be included they all agreed my friend

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know pineapple doesn't belong
in this world it's just us
you know it can't be right or wrong
as it was as it was
you know it can't be

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple defenders stand
why do you think it belongs on a pie
with cheese and tomato sauce
ringin' the
alarm bells go off in my head
its place is on a burger
or in a salad instead my friend oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know pineapple doesn't belong
in this world it's just us
you know it can't be right or wrong
as it was as it was
you know it can't be

[Bridge]
go home and try again tomorrow night
I don't wanna talk about the way that it is
switch to a pepperoni slice instead
I don't wanna talk about who is wrong or right

[Outro]
hey
as it was
you know it can't be right or wrong
as it was as it was
