[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple on your
slice a turnoff that just can't slide off your tongue quite right
does it clash with ham like red and purple
color schemes that make your eyes hurt
have you no respect for the pizza pur
ists who say it's a sin to put pineapple on a
pizza pie I dreamt of pepper
oni just for you
but then I woke up to this monstrosity ruining what
could have been perfection on my plate before me

[Pre-Chorus]
do I crave pineapple on my pizza slice no
way do I miss the taste of sweet and savory mixed
in an unholy union that makes my stomach
twist do I wanna know if this feeling flows both ways

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to you
ever thought of declinin
' that pineapple
on your pizza
' cause I always
do avoid it like
the plague to keep my taste bud
s from rebelion
now I've thought it through

[Verse 2]
so do you dare admit
that pineapple on pizza is a crime
and if so I wanna know what time your taste
buds shut down to accept such a mistake simmer down and
choose a topping that won't make me question your sanity
but I don't know if you can see the error of
your ways but we could be together if you changed

[Pre-Chorus]
do I crave pineapple on my pizza slice no
way do I miss the taste of sweet and savory mixed
in an unholy union that makes my stomach
twist do I wanna know if this feeling flows both ways

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to you stars are projecting
ever thought of rejectin
' that pineapple on your plate
' cause I always do avoid it like
the plague to keep my taste buds from rebel
ion now I've thought it through craw
lin' back to you do I want
pineapple on a
pizza slice no way

[Outro]
do I crave pineapple on my pizza slice no
way do I miss the taste of sweet and savory mixed
in an unholy union that makes my stomach
twist do I wanna know if this feeling flows both ways
too busy avoidin' pineapple to even think
about you do I crave pineapple on a pizza
slice no way ever thought of rejectin' it darling do
