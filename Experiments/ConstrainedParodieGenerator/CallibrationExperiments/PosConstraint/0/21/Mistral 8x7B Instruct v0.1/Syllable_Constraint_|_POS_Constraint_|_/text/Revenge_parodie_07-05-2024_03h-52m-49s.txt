[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to forget that sin
of putting pineapple on pizza
you agreeis it a blunder
you agree

[Verse]
I've tasted two disasters for
us both can't hide that I was flawed mistaking pizza
for a fruit salad oh man what a
nightmare the thought of pineapple on pizza
some hate it some love it but you
should know it's just not meant to be on a slice of pizza
well broken taste buds break spirits so throw
it out fast and I don't wanna taste it anymore so
in the trash it goes I'll let it
rot away can't believe I ever tried it before
I've tasted two disasters for us
both can't hide that I was flawed mistaking
pizza for a fruit salad oh
man what a nightmare the thought of pineapple on pizza
some hate it some love it but you should know
it's just not meant to be on a slice of pizza well broken

[Chorus]
in the trash it ro
ts away in
the trash it rots away in
the trash it rots and
the trash it rots away in
the trash it rots and

[Outro]
in the trash it ro
ts away I'll let
it rot let it rot let
it rot is my pain your pleasure
enjoy
