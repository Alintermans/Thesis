[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise It, I

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
that abomination at
the dinner table on a pizza base
a monstrosity lurking
in the shadows of the fe
we can't abide if we don't want it
where you can never find me
and we'll ban halloween on pizza
and in the night we'll wish it goneaway
we'll wish it goneaway

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where did it come from does it have
a right to claim a place on bread tonight
I need escape and always now
this bitter taste keeps
surfacing on the tip of my tongue oh so
sickeningly sweet and wrong
the texture of a thousand
slimy slimy slugs invading me
as I stare will it ever leave
and end this culinary
horror story on my plate tonight stop
this culinary

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
get it off me now it's already taken
the taste inside my mouth
I despise it I desp
get it off me now it's already taken
the taste inside my mouth
I despise it I desp

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
get it off me now it's already taken
the taste inside my mouth
I despise it I desp
get it off me now it's already taken
the taste inside my mouth
I despise it I desp
get it off me now it's already taken
the taste inside my mouth
I despise it I desp
get it off me now it's already taken
the taste inside my mouth
I despise it I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
