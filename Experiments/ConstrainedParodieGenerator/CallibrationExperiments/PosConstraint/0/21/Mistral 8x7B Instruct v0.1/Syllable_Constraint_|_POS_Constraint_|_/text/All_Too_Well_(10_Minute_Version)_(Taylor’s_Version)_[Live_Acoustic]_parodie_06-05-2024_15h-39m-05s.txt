[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my slice there on that greasy plate
and you still have it in your fridge today yet

[Verse 2]
oh that sweet concoction with its sweet and savory
its flavors clashing like a culinary
autumn leaves of disappointment falling down like
a recipe gone wrong I can't believe

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that taste is not coming back
and I might forget about it soon enough but
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again in front of me tonight
that pineapple pizza making me lose my appetite yes
sauce on my lips I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
toppings scattered on the counter you were laughing saying
it's a classic combo that's been around for ages nowadays folks
but I begged to differ thinking of the perfect slice I'd have
and you were tossing me a slice saying try it you
may like it but I couldn't shake off the thought that it was a
grave mistake and then you wondered where my love went
as I turned away in disgust holding my stomach
I couldn't bear the thought of another bite of it all
too well yes I remember it
all too well yes I remember it all too
well yes I remember it
all too well yes I remember it all too well yes it
was a mistake yes I remember it all too well

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it soon enough
but oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again in front of me tonight
that pineapple pizza making me lose my appetite yes
sauce on my lips I was
there I remember it all too
well yes I remember it all too well yes I rem
ember it all too well yes I remember it all too
well yes I remember
it all too well yes I remember

[Bridge]
well maybe we got carried away yes
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
from the start running
scared I was there I rem
ember it all too well yes it
was a mistake yes I remember it all too well yes it
was a big mistake yes I remember it all too well yes
it was a mistake yes I remember it all
too well yes I remember it

[Verse 4]
I can't believe I ate that monstrosity yes
the combination of flavors was a
crime against my taste buds and I can't seem to forget it yes it
was a nightmare and I can
t believe I fell for it yes I can't
believe I ate it all yes I can't believe I ate it all yes it
was a mistake yes I remember
it all too well yes I remember it
all too well yes it
was a mistake yes I remember it all
too well yes I remember it all too well yes
it was a mistake yes I remember it all too well yes it
was a mistake yes I remember it all too well yes

[Verse 5]
time can't erase the memory of that taste
I wish I could forget it but it still lingers on and on and on
and every time I see a pineapple pizza
I'm taken back to that moment of pure disgust
and I can't help but remember it all too
well yes I remember it all too well yes I rem
ember it all too well yes
it was a mistake yes I remem

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again in front of me once
more that pineapple pizza making me lose my ap
petite yes sauce on lips
I remember it all too well
yes I remember it all
too well yes I remem
ber it all too well yes
it was a mistake yes
I remember it all
too well yes I remember it

[Verse 6]
and I was never a fan of pineapple on pizza no
my taste buds scream in sheer disgust every
time I see it on a menu and it
reminds me of that moment of pure regret
and I can't help but remember
it all too well yes I remember it all too
well yes I remember it
all too well yes I remember it all
too well yes I remember it
all too well yes I remember

[Outro]
just between us it was a mistake yes I remember
it all too well yes I remember it all too well
yes I remember it all too well yes I remember it all
too well yes I remember it all too
well yes I remember it all too
well yes I remember it all too
