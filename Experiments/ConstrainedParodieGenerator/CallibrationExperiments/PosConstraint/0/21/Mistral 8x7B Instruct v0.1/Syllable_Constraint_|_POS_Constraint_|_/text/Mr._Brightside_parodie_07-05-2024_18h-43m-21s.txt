[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
pizza stone cold now cause I wanted pineapple
it started with a slice now my heart feels so trite austin
it was only a bite it was only a bite
now I'm full of regret and my stomach feels ill
while they're ordering pepperoni and eating
now they're enjoying their meal and I'm feeling so
and it's all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savoring the taste
my slice is a waste now
leave me be
cause I just can't bear this tragedy
and ruining the

[Chorus]
disgust turnin' pizza lovers away
choosin' pineapple ruins
fruit on a savory dish
but it's just the bitter taste
condemnation
raising my weary eyes now
cause I'm mr no

[Guitar Solo]
