[Verse 1]
two slices tried and my ver
dict is clear trying to shirk icianally
from that pineapple pie
but it's just not the same without some ham
forget about that sweet and sour combo man it
never did sit right with

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I take a bite in
disguise to get it all out my disdain
and I i am feeling a little repulsive
and so I rise in the morning and I step outside
without a slice in hand and I take a deep
breath and I refuse to even touch
what's

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on with
that pineapple on a
pizza hey
hey hey hey I said hey what's wrong

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh uh u
oh oh
oh
oh uh u

[Verse 2]
and I fight
oh my god do I fight
I resist all the
time in this delusion
and I bite
oh my god do I bite
I bite every single time
for revolution

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I take a bite in
disguise to get it all out my disdain
and I i am feeling a little repulsive
and so I rise in the morning and I step outside
without a slice in hand and I take a deep
breath and I refuse to even touch
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on
with that pineapple on
a pizza
hey hey hey I said hey what's wrong
and I say hey hey hey
wake in the morning and step outside
take a deep
breath and I refuse to even touch
and I scream
I said hey a what's going on
and I say hey hey hey
wake in the morning and step outside
take a deep breath and
I refuse to even touch and I
scream I said
hey a what's going on with that

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh uh u

[Outro]
two slices tried and my ver
dict is clear trying to get up that great big
hill of hope for a pizza
