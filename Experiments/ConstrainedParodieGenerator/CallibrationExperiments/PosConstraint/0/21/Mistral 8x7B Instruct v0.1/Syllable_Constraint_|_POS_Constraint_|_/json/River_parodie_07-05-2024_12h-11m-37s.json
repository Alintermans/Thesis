He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine all the time\nbut now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with his hunger growling loud\nmouth watering for pizza now\nbut then he sees the pineapple on\ntop and turns it down with a frown on his face now\nit's a debate but he can't take the taste of\nit mixed with tomato sauce and cheese it\njust ain't right he'd rather eat a slice of pie instead\nit's a crime to put pineapple on pizza believe it or not folks\nhe'd rather have pepperron\nor mushrooms or even sausage on his pizza than that\nbut she won't listen to his protestations\nshe insists on putting pineapple on their pizza cre\nations and now he's had enough\nhe's leaving her for good he's packing up and shipping\nout he's had it with her pineapple obsession so he's off to\nstart anew and find someone who appreci\nates a classic pizza without the sweet\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine all the time\nbut now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one night stand turned a two night stand yeah\nit was supposed to be just a prank but then she\nput pineapple on the pizza and now he\ncan't look at her the same way again he\nthought she was normal but now he sees she's insane she\ndoesn't understand that pineapple on pizza is\na sin but she just laughs and says he's being a baby\nhe can't take it he's had enough he's gotta leave before he goes mad\nso he packs up his bags and he's off to find someone new someone who\nappreciates a good pizza without\nthe sweet fruit on top someone who understands that pine\napple has no place on a pizza pie he's gotta get out\nbefore he loses his mind he can't take\nthe pineapple on pizza anymore\nnever again he swears it's the end\nof this pineapple on pizza madness for him\nforevermore amen amen amen\nnow let the river run\nmy name's no longer pineapple pizza guy\nit's just pizza guy from now on goodbye pineapple pizza\nfore\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's no longer pine\napple\ngu\ny river\nrun call me pizza guy\nwe'll let the river run without pine\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the bridesmaid never\nthe bride hey what can I say if pizza\nwas a highway and pineapple was a dead end sign I\nwould be swerving to avoid it every time it\ncomes into view it's a disaster a\npizza abomination\nwhat else can I say I can't take it\nanymore it's time to speak out against the pine\napple pizza tyranny it's time to take\nback the pizza for the people who\nappreciate the classic toppings not the\nsweet and sticky mess that is pineapple on\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine all the time\nbut now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind\nwell little one\nI don't\n\nwant to admit to something I'm sorry\nif all it\n\n's gonna cause is pain the truth and\nmy lies now are falling like the rain so let the\n",
