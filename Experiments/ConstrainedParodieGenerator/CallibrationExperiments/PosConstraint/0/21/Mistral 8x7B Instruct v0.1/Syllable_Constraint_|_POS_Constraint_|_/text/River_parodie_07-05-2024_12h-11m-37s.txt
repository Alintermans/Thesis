[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine all the time
but now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his hunger growling loud
mouth watering for pizza now
but then he sees the pineapple on
top and turns it down with a frown on his face now
it's a debate but he can't take the taste of
it mixed with tomato sauce and cheese it
just ain't right he'd rather eat a slice of pie instead
it's a crime to put pineapple on pizza believe it or not folks
he'd rather have pepperron
or mushrooms or even sausage on his pizza than that
but she won't listen to his protestations
she insists on putting pineapple on their pizza cre
ations and now he's had enough
he's leaving her for good he's packing up and shipping
out he's had it with her pineapple obsession so he's off to
start anew and find someone who appreci
ates a classic pizza without the sweet

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine all the time
but now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand yeah
it was supposed to be just a prank but then she
put pineapple on the pizza and now he
can't look at her the same way again he
thought she was normal but now he sees she's insane she
doesn't understand that pineapple on pizza is
a sin but she just laughs and says he's being a baby
he can't take it he's had enough he's gotta leave before he goes mad
so he packs up his bags and he's off to find someone new someone who
appreciates a good pizza without
the sweet fruit on top someone who understands that pine
apple has no place on a pizza pie he's gotta get out
before he loses his mind he can't take
the pineapple on pizza anymore
never again he swears it's the end
of this pineapple on pizza madness for him
forevermore amen amen amen
now let the river run
my name's no longer pineapple pizza guy
it's just pizza guy from now on goodbye pineapple pizza
fore

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine all the time
but now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's no longer pine
apple
gu
y river
run call me pizza guy
we'll let the river run without pine

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never
the bride hey what can I say if pizza
was a highway and pineapple was a dead end sign I
would be swerving to avoid it every time it
comes into view it's a disaster a
pizza abomination
what else can I say I can't take it
anymore it's time to speak out against the pine
apple pizza tyranny it's time to take
back the pizza for the people who
appreciate the classic toppings not the
sweet and sticky mess that is pineapple on

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine all the time
but now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind
well little one
I don't
want to admit to something I'm sorry
if all it
's gonna cause is pain the truth and
my lies now are falling like the rain so let the
river run no more pine
