[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a culinary crime
don't you think it's gross inside
you can't cover up the taste with extra cheese
it's just wrong on a pizza
it's not something to relish

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted better things before now
why do we keep coming back for more of
the pineapple no one
we've tasted better things before now
why do we keep coming back for more of
the pineapple no one

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
put down that pineapple slice and hear me
they said it's a mistake to miss
we gotta get away from this

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
let's stick to traditional
pepperoni or sausage
remember how it tasted used to be
we can make it right again
somewhere far away from pine

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted better things before now
why do we keep coming back for more of
the pineapple no one
we've tasted better things before now
why do we keep coming back for more of
the pineapple no one

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
stop eating that pineapple slice and listen
they said it's a recipe to
get away from this disaster

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted better things before now
why do we keep coming back for more of
the pineapple no one
we've tasted better things before now
why do we keep coming back for more of
the pineapple no one

[Bridge]
we don't taste enough
we should open up
before it's all
too much pineapple
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my pleaxclam
we gotta get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
