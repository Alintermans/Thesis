[Verse 1]
just a small town slicesain' in a lonely world
serving up pies with such bitter taste despair
just a city boy raised on a pepperoni
he took a slice of pie with pineapple there

[Verse 2]
a chef in a steamy kitchen
the scent of cheese and tomato
for a paycheck they can share the
disgust it goes on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
customers wait
up and down the boulevard
their faces turning sour in
light of pineap
pizzas made with no emotion
pineapple found where it shouldn

[Verse 3]
catering to every
bizarre craving some people
mistakenly think it belongs on
a pizza slice

[Verse 4]
some will grimace some will
gag at this monstrosity
oh the horror never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
customers wait
up and down the boulevard
their faces turning sour in
light of pineap
pizzas made with no emotion
pineapple found where it shouldn

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hatin'
let that disgust be your
streetlights people
don't stop hatin'keep
that dis
treetlights people
don't stop hatin'keep
that disgust alive in
streetlights people
