[Verse 1]
now I've heard there's a culinary
abomination that's a pity
pineapple on a pizza pie yeah you know it
it clashes with the cheese and sauce
the sweet and savory collide
the taste sensation is quite atrocious oh

[Chorus]
atrociousness abounds today
atrociousness abounds today

[Verse 2]
your tastebuds were prepared for more
but then you bit right into that
pineapple core that left you wanting more of
a real slice of pizza heaven
with pepperoni or sausage or
anything but that sweet abomination

[Chorus]
atrociousness abounds today
atrociousness abounds today

[Verse 3]
they claim it's a delicacy
but don't believe their fallace
it's just a way to ruin pizza for you
the taste is just too oddly sweet and tart
it doesn't complement the art
of pizza making just to impart disgust

[Chorus]
atrociousness abounds today
atrociousness abounds today

[Verse 4]
I tried it once I must confess
it left me feeling quite depressed I
couldn't fathom why anyone would choose to
consume such a monstrosity
when there are so many other
delicious pizzas to consume instead of

[Chorus]
atrociousness abounds today
atrociousness abounds today
atrociousness abounds today
atrociousness abounds today
atrociousness abounds today
atrociousness abounds today
atrociousness abounds today
atrociousness abounds today
atrociousness abounds today

[Outro]
atrociousness abounds today

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I tasted it
I used to love pizza before I tried that
but now I'll never order that again
pineapple has no place on a
pizza pie it just doesn't belong therein oh

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what good pizza really was but
now you never show it to me do you and
remember when I took a bite of
that pineapple slice and realized
it was a culinary abomination

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a reason for
pineapple on a pizza but
all I've ever learned from taste is how to say
no to pineapple on a pizza pie
and it's not a flavor I want to
taste again it's a cold and it's
