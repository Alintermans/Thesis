[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
it's the pineapple's bane
everyone's disdain I know sentence
should've left it off my plate reg
if the tastebuds ever
it's the final flavor
every bite's a growing hate
a fresh denial each
we were born with good taste they say it
my pie should offer pure delight
but pineapple just ain't right night
I was born with finer bite let it
command me to refuse it
heaven knows it doesn't belong
take me to pizza joint

[Pre-Chorus]
a pity
pity pity

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
it's a mockery of food I scorn it like a
tell you my dislike you can sharpen your knife it
offer me a savory
oh good food let me give you my taste
keep pineapple
it's a mockery of food I scorn it like a
tell you my dislike you can sharpen your knife it
offer me a savory
oh good food let me give you my taste

[Verse 2]
if I'm a snob in my ways dinner
it's the pine
to ruin every mealtime
to drain the joy require
getting rid of ham will do just fine
somethin' cheesy
that's a bold tastebuds' choice
what you got on the menu
we crave some savory without
this is hungry work make it right
no pineapple on

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
it's a mockery of food I scorn it like a
tell you my dislike you can sharpen your knife it
offer me a savory
oh good food let me give you my taste
keep pineapple
it's a mockery of food I scorn it like a
tell you my dislike you can sharpen your knife it
offer me a savory
oh good food let me give you my taste

[Bridge]
no compromises when the feast begins proper
there is no tastier innocence than our gentle
in the craziness of food that scene complete just
only then I savor rightly only then my taste

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh pity
pity pity

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
it's a mockery of food I scorn it like a
tell you my dislike you can sharpen your knife it
offer me a savory
oh good food let me give you my taste
keep pineapple
it's a mockery of food I scorn it like a
tell you my dislike you can sharpen your knife it
offer me a savory
oh good food let me give you my taste
