[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to savor the
taste of pizza heavenly he
now in the morning I taste only
disappointment and sorrow

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to love pineap
on my pizza without a carep
taste exploding in my mouth
but now it only brings me naught but doubt
one bite I tasted sweetness
next a bitter taste did rise
and I discovered that my pizza's great
with mushrooms or sausage but never pineap

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear kettles whistling louda' ringin
pizza lovers gasping with disgust
be my pepperoni and
cheese oozing in between the slicesplease
for some reason I can't explain
once you tasted pineapple
there was never any
honest craving for pizza like

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a tropical and wrong
idea to put pineapple
on pizza but I went along with
the trend and now I regret it sorely
revolutionaries wait
for my apology on a
silver plate but who would ever wanna eat
pizza with pineapple again is

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear kettles whistling louda' ringing
pizza lovers gasping with disgust
be my mozzarella
and tomato sauce covering the dough
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't deny me
an honest pizza pie
but that was before I tasted

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
I hear kettles whistling louda' ring
pizza lovers singing
hoorah for pizza without pineap
for some reason I can
explain it now I know better
pizza without pineap
is the only way to be satisfied
oh who would ever want
pizza with pineapple again is
oh who would ever want
pizza with pineapple again is oh
who would ever want oh
pizza with pineapple again

[Outro]
mmm no mmm no
mmm no mmm no
mmm no
