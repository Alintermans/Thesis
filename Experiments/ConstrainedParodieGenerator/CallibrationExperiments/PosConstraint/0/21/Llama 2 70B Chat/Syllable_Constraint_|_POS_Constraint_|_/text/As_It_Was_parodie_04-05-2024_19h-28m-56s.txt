[Intro]
come on pizza lovers we wanna say no to

[Verse 1]
pineapples on
top of the pie they're holdin
us back from the flavor we desire yeah
we don't want your sweetness on
our pizza
nothing to do with the taste bud
ain't no replacement for
the real deal no oh oh gotta keep it

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
of the pepperoni it
rings in our ears and nobody's home
your taste buds live by themselves
they just want to
know that you're well oh oh oh got
to keep it real no oh oh
its not worth the risk of a bad combo when

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
pepperonis at home get ahead flav
or town I don't wanna talk about the way that
pepperonis at home get ahead flav
or town I don't wanna talk about who's doin'

[Outro]
it
you know it
you know its not the same as it was
as it was as it was
