[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
makes me wanna lose my
appetite every

[Verse 1]
can't believe they'd do this to a beautiful pie
ruining the flavor and
the texture why oh why would
they even try it's such a
crime against humanity it
makes me wanna cry get a at
pita if you want some fruit
on your pizza that's just not what it does it for
me I'll stick to pepperoni and sa
usage that's the way that it should be usa is where pineapple
belongs not on my pizza
making it all soggy and
sweet it's just not right it's a sin it's a shame it's a
fruit that doesn't belong on a

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime makes me wanna lose my appetite every
single time why can't they just leave well enough alone it's a
pizza not a fruit salad

[Verse 2]
you call me a hater for not lik
ing pineapple on my pizza but
I don't care I'll stand my ground it's just not
right it's like putting ketchup on a hot
dog or mayonnaise on a
taco it's a travesty it
makes me wanna scream why can't
people just follow the rules

[Verse 3]
I don't post about it on the internet I don
't want to start a fight but when I see it
in person I can't help but speak my mind it
just ain't right it's like they're trying to ru
in a good thing I could go on and on
about all the times that pineapple
ruined my meal but I'll just keep it to myself instead and
just stick to what I know and love pepperoni and
sausage that's the way it's supposed to be it's a fact it
ain't up for debate so just leave the fruit

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
said it was just a misunderstand
ing made every pizza
my enemy just leave me and my food

one e
