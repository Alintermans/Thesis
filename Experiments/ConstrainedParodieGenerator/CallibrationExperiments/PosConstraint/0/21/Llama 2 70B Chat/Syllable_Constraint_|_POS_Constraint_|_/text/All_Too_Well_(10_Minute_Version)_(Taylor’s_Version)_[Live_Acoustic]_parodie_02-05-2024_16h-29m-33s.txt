[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong it was
like a crime scene without a care but something

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory gaze autumn
leaves falling down like anchovies in disgra
order and I can picture it after all these
days and I can picture it after all these

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pepperonI's not the
and I might be okay but my taste buds are not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost burned the crust because you were looking over at
peppers onion olives and
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
photo of pineapple on the menu counter your face
was turning red you used to be a little kid with a big appet
ite and your mother's telling stories bout you and your love for
anchovies and you told me bout your cravings thinking
your future was me and you were tossing me the slice I was
always skipping town and I was thinking on the
drive down he's gonna say it's love you never called it
what it was til we were dead and gone and buried check the
pulse and come back swearing it's the
same after three months in the grave and then you
wondered where it went to as
I reached for you but all I felt was shame and you heldmy
lifeless frame I remember it all too well cause there

[Pre-Chorus]
we're dancing round the kitchen
in the refrigerator light
down the stairs I was there I remember
it all too well and there we are

[Chorus]
again when nobody had to know you kept me
like a secret but I kept you like an oath sacred prayer and
we'd swear to remember
it all too well yeah maybe we
got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it
all up running scared I
was there I remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paper just
lying here cause I remember

[Verse 4]
it all all all they say all's well that ends well but im
in a new hell every time you doub
lecross my mind you said if we had been closer in age maybe it
would have been fine and that made
me want to die the idea you had of
me who was she a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shrine re
flects on you not weeping in a pa
rty bathroom some actress asking me what
happened you that's what
happened you you who charmed my dad with self eff
acing jokes sipping coffee like you're on a late
night show but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you
to come and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twice

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old pizza box from that very
first week cause it reminds you of innocence and it
smells like me you can't get
rid of it cause you remember it

[Chorus]
all too well yeah cause there we are again
when I loved you so back before you lost the one real
thing you've ever known it
was rare I was there I remem
ber it all too well wind in
my hair you were there you
remember it all oh
it was rare I was there
I remember it all
too well and I was never good

[Verse 6]
at telling jokes but the punch line goes I'll get older but your
lovers stay my age from when your hawaiian
shirt broke my skin and bones I'm a soldier
who's returning half her weight and did the tin
flame bruise paint you blue just between us
did the love affair maim you too cause in this cit
y's barren cold I still re
member the first fall of snow and how it
glistened as it fell I remem
ber it all too well just between

[Outro]
us did the love affair maim you all too well just between
us do you remember it all too well just between
us I remember it all too well wind in my hair I was there
down the stairs I was there sacred prayeri
was there it was rare you remember
it all too well wind In my hair I
was there down the stairs I was there sacred prayer
I was there it was rare you remember
it all too well wind In my hair I
was there down the stairs I was there just
between us I remember it
all too well wind in my hair I was there
down the stairs I was there sacred prayer
I was there it was rare you re mem
ber it all too well wind in and
my hair I was there down the stairs I
was there sacred prayer I was there it
was rare you remember it all too
