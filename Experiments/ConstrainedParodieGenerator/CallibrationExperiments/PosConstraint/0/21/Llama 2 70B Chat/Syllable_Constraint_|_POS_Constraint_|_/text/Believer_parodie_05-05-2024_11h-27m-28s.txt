[Verse 1]
first things first
I got a message that's burning in me
I'm fired up and tired of
the way that pizza's been neglect
the way that pizza's been neglect

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you tell me what you think that I should eat
I'm the one who knows what
I'm the master of my taste buds sea
the master of my taste buds sea

[Pre-Chorus]
I was confused from a young age
taking my frustration to the plate
writing my manifesto for
the few that look at me and nod in agreement took
at me and shook at me and felt
singing from my heart about the
pain of eating something that's just
not meant to be on a pizza

[Chorus]
pineapple you made me a you made
me a believer bel
iever pineapple you break me down
you build me up belie
believer pineapple oh let the toppings
fly oh let them rain my taste my love
my drive it came from pineapple you
made me a you made me

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a message to the ones up high
all the hate that they've heard
has turned my stomach into a knot oh
my stomach up in a knot oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was choking in the crowd
building my argument up in
the cloud falling like crumbs to the
ground hoping my point would get through
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited till it broke open and rained down
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pineapple you made me a you made
me a believer bel
iever pineapple you break me down
you build me up belie
believer pineapple oh let the toppings
fly oh let them rain my taste my love
my drive it came from pineapple you
made me a you made me

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the oven and the heat
you're the face of the future
the flavor in my mouth oh
the flavor in my mouth oh

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited till it broke open and rained down
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pineapple you made me a you made
me a believer bel
iever pineapple you break me down
you build me up belie
believer pineapple oh let the toppings
fly oh let them rain my taste my love
my drive it came from pineapple you
made me a you made me
