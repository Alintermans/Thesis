[Intro]
can we talk about pineapple on a

[Verse 1]
pizza crust so fine and so
fresh with toppings galore but then
you add some pineapple and
it's just a no from

[Pre-Chorus]
me I don't understand why you'd do that to a good
pizza it's like putting ketchup on a hot dog or mayonna
on a taco it's just not right it's a crime against human
ity a travesty a culinary abomination

[Chorus]
was it over when you ruined a good pie
was it over when you made me question your
sanity was it over when
you said pineapple belongs on a
pizza I whispered in your ear this is not

[Post-Chorus]
acceptable it's not

[Verse 2]
you lost control and added
ham and pineapple to
a beautiful pie red sau
ce white cheese blue topping

[Bridge]
and did you think I wouldn't notice
the horror you've com
mitted there's no decency in
ruining a classic like
that only an abomination
a culinary
sin oh lord I think about ski
pping town just to escape the
thought of pineapple on a
pizza it's jumping the shark it's a crying

[Pre-Chorus]
shame let's fast forward to three hundred failed pizza orders lat
er if it's got pineapple I will not compromise my taste buds
you dream of my praise before it calls you a lying traitor you
search in every pizza joint for something greater baby ' u

[Chorus]
was it over when you ruined a good pie
was it over when you made me question your
sanity was it over when
you said pineapple belongs on a
pizza I whispered in your ear this is not

[Post-Chorus]
accept
able it's not is it
accept
able it's not

[Bridge]
think I didn't see you
there were flashing lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my disgust out of
sight only rumors of my anger
and my whispered dis
gust oh lord I think about ski
pping town just to escape the
thought of pineapple on a pizza
it's jumping the shark it's a crying shame a

[Outro]
culinary abom
ination let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees
later and hope that pineapple is not
an option and say the one
thing I've been wanting but
no it
is it is it is it is it is it
