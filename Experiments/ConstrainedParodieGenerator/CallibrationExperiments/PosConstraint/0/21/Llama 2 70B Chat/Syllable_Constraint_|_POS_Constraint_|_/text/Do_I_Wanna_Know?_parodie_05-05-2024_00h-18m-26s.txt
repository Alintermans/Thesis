[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' while we're meetin' some people say
it's a topping that's quite neat but to me
it's a crime that can't be beat
do you ever get that feelin' that you
can't shift the taste that sticks around like summat in
your teeth are there some flavors up
your sleeve have you no
idea that pineapple don't belong on a pizza
I've dreamt about pizza nearly every night

[Pre-Chorus]
this pizza without pineapple is what I seek
don't wanna fall asleep with a stomachache from
eatin' something that just don't feel right do I
wanna know if you feel the same way too or is it

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to
the way that pizza used to
taste before the
pineapple took
over maybe
I'm too busy lov
in' pizza the way it should
be to fall for som
ethin' new

[Verse 2]
so have you got the gut
s to take a stand against the pineap
ple crowd or do you just go with the flow and
pretend that it's okay to put pineapple on a pie
I've been wonderin' if your taste buds are still open to tried
and true flavors or if you've given in to the hip
ster crew I'm sorry to interrupt but I got

[Pre-Chorus]
this pizza without pineapple is what I seek
don't wanna fall asleep with a stomachache from
eatin' something that just don't feel right do I
wanna know if you feel the same way too or is it

[Chorus]
to know if you feel the same way too or
is it just me maybe we
can be together in this
fight against pineapple on pizza
if you wanted to we could be unsto
ppable take a stand and let our
voices be heard crawlin' back
to the way that things
should be crawlin' back

[Outro]
to the way that pizza used to taste before the
pineapple took over maybe we're too busy lov
in' pizza the way it should be to fall for som
ethin' new do you want me crawlin' back to the way
that pizza used to be do you want me crawlin' back
to you please don't put pineapple on
your pizza that's all I ask of you baby we both know
