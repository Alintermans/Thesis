[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the pineapple on top that'
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've ordered something else
if the delivery ever
brought something fresh and new
a pineapple on a pizza's
just not something I'd che
my taste buds are crying out for help
my stomach's in a bitter war
pineapple does not belong near a
pepperoni or a sausage for
get that tropical fruit off
my pie take it away I pray
let my pizza be pure

[Pre-Chorus]
a pizza
oh pizza oh

[Chorus]
take my pizza
away from the pineapple's lies deception and
I'll never tell you what toppings I desire
just keep that fruit far away
good pizza let me give you my life
take my pizza
away from the pineapple's lies deception and
I'll never tell you what toppings I desire
just keep that fruit far away
good pizza let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
if I'm a lover of the classic
my pizza's the real deal
to keep the taste buds on my
side they demand something real
drain the pineapple of its juice to
something edible for my mouth
that's a fine lookin' pepper
oni what you got in the
kitchen that's what I want to know
we've a lot of hungry people
and pineapple just

[Chorus]
take my pizza
away from the pineapple's lies deception and
I'll never tell you what toppings I desire
just keep that fruit far away
good pizza let me give you my life
take my pizza
away from the pineapple's lies deception and
I'll never tell you what toppings I desire
just keep that fruit far away
good pizza let me give you my life

[Bridge]
no pineapple on my pizza when the meal comm
there is no sweeter taste than a classic pepperoni
in the madness and soap of that commercial scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh pizza
pizza oh I

[Chorus]
take my pizza
away from the pineapple's lies deception and
I'll never tell you what toppings I desire
just keep that fruit far away
good pizza let me give you my life
take my pizza
away from the pineapple's lies deception and
I'll never tell you what toppings I desire
just keep that fruit far away
good pizza let me give you my life
