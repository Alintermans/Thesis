[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our culinary throne
we're tastier than ever known
it's harder to explain

[Verse 1]
give it a slice or two to ponder and mull over
to create a better taste
to compose a savory
do you relish our flav
or does our combination
leave you feeling quite removed comes
pineapple on your pizza
I knew when I asked you to try it beside me
you'd turn up your nose and deny me your
promise of a delicious pairing we'd share it with glee instead you
ended up ruining the
entire meal's harmony
so if you really wanna know the key to our
perfectly balanced delight then

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now we're tastier
we're happier than ever known it's easier to
explain it better we wish it wasn't true ohhohoohooho
it's just a matter of taste

[Verse 2]
you insist on adding it in your
restaurants and menus alike it
scares me to taste buds with its sweetness and bite
but I'm wasting my words cause you only
listen to your customers
we don't belong together
with our flavors so dispar
what goes best with tomato

[Verse 3]
and I don't bash pineapple on the food forums or
anywhere else I'd rather focus on
the classic combinations that bring us delight
but the memories of our shared meals gone
so wrong leave a bitter taste in my mouth
and don't waste my time trying to
convince me otherwise I could share a tale of every
time you served me a perfectly cooked pie but I'd have
an empty story to tell since you never did offer
something without that unwelcome addition

[Outro]
you changed everything good turns
disgusting with your confusing rule
made all our memories
just fruitless combinations leave me free
yes
yes please
ah
farewell
goddam
