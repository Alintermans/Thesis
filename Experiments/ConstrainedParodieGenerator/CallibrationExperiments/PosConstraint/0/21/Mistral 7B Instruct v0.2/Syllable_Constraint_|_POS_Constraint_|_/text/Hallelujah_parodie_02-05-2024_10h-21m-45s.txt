[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that hawaii cooked and it caused a
disbelief in your palate's core then again
it doesn't really matter to
you pineapple on the pizza
the sixth tone clashes bitterly with the fifth

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 2]
your appetite was strong but you were
puzzled by this combination
its sweetness in your mouth overwhelmed yathen
she served it up with savory
toppings torn apart in frustration
and from your plate she drew the hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 3]
you say I chose this fruit in vain
I don't even know the name
but if I did well just imagine the pain
there's a contrast in every bite that
we tasted never related
the savory or the exotic hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't savor so I
tried to mix the flavors upbut if I did
it all went wrong I'll stand before
the critic of taste with nothing
but hallelujah pineapple pie on its

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Outro]
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this cuisine I've
tasted before but now you never serve it
to me and remember when I moved in
you the savory was moving
and every bite we took was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never offer it to me do
and remember when I moved in you
the cheesy delight was moving
and every bite we took was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to add an ingredient that out
shines the others in the dish it's not a
cry that you hear at night it's not som
one who's tasted the delight it's a cold and it
