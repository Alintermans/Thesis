[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the intrusion of this fruit
on my pizza's pristine surface below
an unwelcome addition
in the realm of savory
we can't live in harmony now if we
want our pizzas pure and
without this pineapple intrusion
and in the oven we will bake no more
our perfect pies that

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the cheese and tomato
and I am so sorry for this blunder
I desire tradition and
this unexpected
pineapple topping comes creeping in each time
and as I contemplate it
the olives from the garden
make their presence known and eat away
at consistency and balance
and leave us with a flavor
that's not quite right tonight or any night

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't top your pizza with this fruit senseless
you're already the voice
inside my head repeats
don't top your pizza with this fruit senseless
you're already the voice
inside my head repeats

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't top your pizza with this fruit senseless
you're already the voice
inside my head repeats
don't top your pizza with this fruit senseless
you're already the voice
inside my head repeats
don't top your pizza with this fruit senseless
you're already the voice
inside my head repeats
don't top your pizza with this fruit senseless
you're already the voice
inside my head repeats

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
