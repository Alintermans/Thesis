[Verse 1]
have you tasted something strange on
a pie that you've made that's been driving you on edge tonight
this fruit in the middle with its prickly
skin and its tangy bite are you
pineapple people or do you deny
its place on a pizza pie under the moonlight high
why oh why do you insist on
trying to defend
the pineapple's place in the culinary world we know so
well it's a mystery to me and I ponder

[Pre-Chorus]
should we let this debate continue on and on
or should we agree to disagree and move along
for the sake of harmony in the kitchen and
the peace of mind of our dinner guests tonight won

[Chorus]
pineapple back to
ever considered taking
it off your plate
'cause I always do
not a fan of
this tropical fruit
to find a new taste to please
now I've thought it through
pineapple back to

[Verse 2]
have you tried to hide it
inside the sauce or under the cheese to
keep it from being seen or felt or tasted
but it always rises to the surface like a bubble
I propose a compromise let's try a hawaiian with ham
or perhaps a tropical delight with chicken and
we'll see if this combination is the answer

[Pre-Chorus]
should we let this debate continue on and on
or should we agree to disagree and move along
for the sake of harmony in the kitchen and
the peace of mind of our dinner guests tonight won

[Chorus]
pineapple back to consideration
ever thought of substitut
ing it with something new and
delightful for your taste buds to che
would you be willing to give it a chance
now I've thought it through pineapple
back to consideration
just a suggestion
pineapple back

[Outro]
should we agree to disagree on this matter
or should we continue to argue hour after
for the sake of our friendship and the love we
share for good food and good company tonight let's move
on and find a new topic to discuss together
pineapple back to consideration my dear friend
shall we try something new tonight instead pineapple back
