[Verse 1]
just a small pie makerfrom a quaint little town
baking up creations under the moonlight
a picky palate from a tropical isle with
a disdain for pineapple on the pizza

[Verse 2]
a gourmet in an elegant
kitchen filled with savory smell
for harmony in every
bite it goes on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings
searchin' on the grocery
shelves for balance and delightful
veggies peoples
living to savor tastes divine
hiding in the supermark

[Verse 3]
struggling hard to perfect
culinary creations
willing to experiment and risk
one more bite time

[Verse 4]
some succeed in their quest
some prefer the simple best
the culinary journey
goes on and on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings
searchin' on the grocery
shelves for balance and delightful
veggies peoples
living to savor tastes divine
hiding in the supermark

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
keep that taste sensation
delightful to
don't stop believing
finding
delightful to
don't stop believing
keep that taste sensation
delightful to
