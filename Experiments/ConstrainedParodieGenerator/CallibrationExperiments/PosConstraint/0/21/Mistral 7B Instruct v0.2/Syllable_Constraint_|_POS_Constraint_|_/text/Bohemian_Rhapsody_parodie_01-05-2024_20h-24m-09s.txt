[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping fiasco I'm trapped in a culinary
landslide with pineapple on high up above
I'm just a simple pizza lover seeking
no sympathy for my disdain of this fruit's deceitfulness
but I'm easy eat give or take a pepper or two I swear it

[Verse 1]
papa just put the pine
apple on top of my pie placed it there without a sign
papa pizza has only
just begun but now I've ruined it all
papa please don't make me cry if am
not back again this time tomorrow carry
on carry on as if nothing really matters indeed

[Verse 2]
too late my palate has
come undone sends shivers down my taste buds all the time
farewell dear friends I've got to
go gotta leave you all behind and face the
papa ooh any way the cheese flows
I don't wanna eat
sometimes I wish I'd never ordered at all

[Guitar Solo]
