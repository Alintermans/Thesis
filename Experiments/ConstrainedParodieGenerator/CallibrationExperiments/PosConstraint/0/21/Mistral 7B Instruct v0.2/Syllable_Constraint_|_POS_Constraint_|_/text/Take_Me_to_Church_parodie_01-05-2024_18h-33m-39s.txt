[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
he's the sneer at the barbecue with
pineapple on his pizza shoes man
I should've said it sooner bo
if the foodies ever did dec
he's the last true flavor
every slice getting more sour
a fresh frustration each
we were born picky what they say it
my kitchen offers no accept
he says we'll taste in the bedroom hide
the only flavor I'll be served to
is when I'm alone with you
I was born bored but I pine it
keep me from being well

[Pre-Chorus]
a tenet
ameneten

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my preferences and you can shar
offer me that unappet
oh good palategodlet me give
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my preferences and you can shar
offer me that unappet
oh good palategodlet me give

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the good e
my lover's the garnish
to keep the foodie on my side
she demands a compromise
remove the whole pie find something plain
something savory for the main
that's a fine lookin'
what you got in the oven

that looks appetizing that looks
this is hunger work

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my biases and you can sharpen

[Bridge]
no recipes or rules when the culinary
begins there is no purer bliss than our
gastronomic sin in the mad kitchen scene we
only then I am satisfied only then I am

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my preferences and you can shar
offer me that unappet

I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my preferences and you can shar
offer me that unappet
