[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
defies the laws of nature and reason too
it's a crime against cul
topping a pie with something so sweet and
juicy when it's supposed to be savory and neat
I can't believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I i am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my
lungs at the in

[Chorus]
and I say pineapple
pineapple
I said pineapple what's going
on a pizza oh no
pineapple
I said pineapple what's going

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I try to
oh my goodness do they
I try to explain
in this pizza parad
and I pray
oh my goodness do they
I pray every single day
for a world without

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I i am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lung
at the injust

[Chorus]
and I say pineapple

I said pineapple what's go
ing on a pizza oh

I said pineapple what's going
on a pizza no way
pineapple on a pizza never
coexist
goes without saying oh no way oh

[Outro]
twenty five years and my life
still trying to get up that great big hill of
hope for a destination
