a highway and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving
in five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on
ice maybe that's why I may have came at
you sideways and I can't
keep my lies straight but I made you abort
my pineapple baby and this love triangle
left us in a wreck tangled and what else can

bet I really woulda loved your pineapple
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it

falling like the rain so let the river run and
there go my pineapple
