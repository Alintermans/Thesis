[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pineapple from our
the sweet and juicy delight from our
the tropical treat that doesn
never belongs on a pie
we can live without pineapple if we want
where you can always find us

and in the night we'll wish this never ends
we'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]

save us tonight save us tonight
or will we be forever
lost in this pineapple sea of despair
lost in this pineapp

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the voice inside our
we miss our cheese and
don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the voice inside our
we miss our cheese and

don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the voice inside our
we miss our cheese and
don't waste your time on pineapple you
the voice inside our
we miss our cheese and
don't waste your time on p
the voice inside our
we miss our cheese and

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
we miss our cheese and
we miss our cheese and
we miss our cheese and
we miss our cheese and
