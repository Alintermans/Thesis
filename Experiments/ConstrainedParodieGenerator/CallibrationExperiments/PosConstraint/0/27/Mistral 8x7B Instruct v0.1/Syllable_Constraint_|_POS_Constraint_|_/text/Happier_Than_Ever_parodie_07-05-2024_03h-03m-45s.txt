[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
my taste buds scream in horror
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just should not be

[Verse 1]
let me ponder for a while and find a clever line
to write a little ditty
to tell you what to doo do
do you taste my recipes
or ignore my culinary
when I say it shouldn't be
do you even listen to
me asking you to understand me oh so well
you do the opposite of what you said
and add it to my pizza shell oh no no no no no no no no
it shouldn't be this hard to
explain it rationally
it's just not meant to be on a pizza pie it's true
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza pie I'm saying
I'm happier than ever free from bitter taste and
wish I could explain it better but it shouldn't be true uh u
my tastebuds they protest

[Verse 2]
you top it with the pineapple and
ham and bake in the oven heatin
it up you say it's tasty I roll my eyes
at your lack of taste I say it's cheatin
it shouldn't be combined you
say it's just a preference no
I wouldn't treat a pizza this
way I hope you understand

[Verse 3]
and I don't put pineapple on my pizza slices
never have and never will I say it
out loud it's just not done I'd never do that to
my pizza slices it's a shame you did it
so please don't waste my time defending
your choice it's not worth my time I say
I could list all the reasons why it shouldn't be on pizza
but it's just not worth my while I say leave it alone
it ruins the flavor profile it's just not done I say
please just leave it alone it's not meant to be

[Outro]
it ruins everything good
pizza was never understood like
this by adding pineapple
just fuckin' leave it alone yeah fuck you
ah
goddam
ah
fuck you
fuck you
