[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to savor the
taste of pizza heavenly he
now in the morning I sigh alone
missing the taste I used to

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to add pineap
ple to my pizza with a grin wide
looked forward to sinking teeth
into the sweet and savory treat now
one bite in and I regrett
ed my decision to add
it to my slice of heavenly delight
for I found it doesn't belong on pizza

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear chefs crying out in despairing
pineapple on pizza will never
be my ally they say and so
it's time to let it go away from dough
for some reason I can't abide
the combination of sweet
and savory on a
single slice of pizza I once

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a dangerous and wrong
decision to add pineapple
to my pizza and ruin it all
fruits don't belong on a savory
slice of heavenly delight
revolutionaries unite
against the evil of pineapple on top
of our beloved pizza will not

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear chefs crying out in despairing
pineapple on pizza will never
be my ally they say and so
it's time to let it go away from dough
for some reason I can't abide
the combination of sweet and savour
y on a single slice
of pizza I once ruled supreme

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
hear chefs crying out in despairing
pineapple on pizza
will never be my ally they say
oh no oh no oh no
be my savory delight they
plead but I must decline
oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no
pineapple on pizza
is a crime against humanity
oh no oh no oh no
it's time to let it go away from dough
never again will it
mar the perfection of pizza

[Outro]
oh no oh no
oh no oh no
oh no
