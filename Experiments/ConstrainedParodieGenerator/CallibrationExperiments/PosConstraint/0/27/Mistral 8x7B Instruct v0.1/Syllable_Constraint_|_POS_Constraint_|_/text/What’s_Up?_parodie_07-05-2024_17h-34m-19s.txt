[Verse 1]
two slices tried and my ver
dict is clear trying to shirk icianally
from that pineapple pie
but it's just not the same without some ham
forget about that sweet and sour combo man it
never did sit right with

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I take a bite in
disguise to get it all out my disdain
and I i am feeling a little repulsive
and so I rise in the morning and I leave behind
that greasy box of disappointment and I
shout out loud from the side of the street
what's up with that

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's up with that on
my pizza pie today
and I say
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh uh
oh oh
oh
oh uh oh

[Verse 2]
and I tried
oh my god did I tried
I tried all the time
in every dining
but I cried
oh my god did I cried
I cried every single time
for pineapple div

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I take a bite in
disguise to get it all out my disdain
and I i am feeling a little repulsive
and so I rise in the morning and I leave behind
that greasy box of disappointment and I
shout out loud from the side of the street
what's up with that

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's up with that
on my pizza pie tod
and I say
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
and I say hey hey hey
wake in the morning and leave behind
that greasy
box of disappointment and I shout
out loud from
the side of the street what's up with
that and I say hey hey
wake in the morning and leave behind
that greasy box of
disappointment and I shout out loud
from the side
of the street what's up with that and

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh uh oh

[Outro]
two slices tried and my ver
dict is clear trying to shirk icianally
from that pineapple pie hell
