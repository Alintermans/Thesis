[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine all the time
but now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his hunger growling loud
mouth watering for pizza now
but then he sees the pineapple on
top and turns it down with a frown on his face now
it's a debate but he can't take the taste of
it mixed with tomato sauce and cheese it
just ain't right he'd rather eat a slice of pie instead
it's a crime to put pineapple on pizza believe it or not folks
he'd rather have pepperron
or mushrooms or even sausage on his pizza than that
but she won't listen to his protestations
she insists on putting pineapple on their pizza cre
ations and now he's had enough
he's leaving her for good he's packing up and shipping
out he's had it with her pineapple obsession Ï€ day or not
pizza night's a flop with pineapple on top
that's a fact and he won't stand for it

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine all the time
but now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand yeah
it was meant to be just a laugh but then she went
and put pineapple on the pizza again
he couldn't believe his eyes it was a sin
now how is he supposed to tell this girl that they're through
it's hard to find the words he doesn't know what to do
he can't stand the taste of pineapple on his pizza
it's a deal breaker for him and now he's in a crisis he's confused he
just can't take it anymore he's had it with the pineapple war
and now he's walking out the door
he can't stand the thought of another slice with pine
apple on it he just can't take it anymore it's a
pineapple free zone for him from now on he
just can't take it anymore it's a
pineapple free zone for him from now
on he just can't take it anymore it's a
pineapple free zone for him from now on
never again will he
tolerate the taste of pineapple on his
pizza he just can't take it anymore it's a pineap
ple

I've been a joker saying pine

but now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's river my name
says no
to
pineapple
river run river run
no pineapple on my pizza no

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the skeptic never a fan of
pineapple on pizza never will be
fuck can I say if life was a highway and pineapple
was a car I'd swerve to avoid it at any cost
speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on
ice maybe that's why I can
't stand the thought of pineapple on pizza
it's a crime to put it on there it just ain't
right it's a travesty a tragedy a
disaster I can't abide it
pizza night's ruined with pineapple on top
that's a fact and I won't stand for it no

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine all the time
but now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
's gonna cause is pain the truth and
my lies now are falling like the rain so let the
river run no more pine
