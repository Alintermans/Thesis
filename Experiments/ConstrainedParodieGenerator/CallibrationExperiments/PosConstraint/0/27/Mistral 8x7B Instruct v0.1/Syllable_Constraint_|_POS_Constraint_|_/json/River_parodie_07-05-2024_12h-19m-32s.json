He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine all the time\nbut now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with his hunger growling loud\nmouth watering for pizza now\nbut then he sees the pineapple on\ntop and turns it down with a frown on his face now\nit's a debate but he can't take the taste of\nit mixed with tomato sauce and cheese it\njust ain't right he'd rather eat a slice of pie instead\nit's a crime to put pineapple on pizza believe it or not folks\nhe'd rather have pepperron\nor mushrooms or even sausage on his pizza than that\nbut she won't listen to his protestations\nshe insists on putting pineapple on their pizza cre\nations and now he's had enough\nhe's leaving her for good he's packing up and shipping\nout he's had it with her pineapple obsession \u03c0 day or not\npizza night's a flop with pineapple on top\nthat's a fact and he won't stand for it\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine all the time\nbut now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one night stand turned a two night stand yeah\nit was meant to be just a laugh but then she went\nand put pineapple on the pizza again\nhe couldn't believe his eyes it was a sin\nnow how is he supposed to tell this girl that they're through\nit's hard to find the words he doesn't know what to do\nhe can't stand the taste of pineapple on his pizza\nit's a deal breaker for him and now he's in a crisis he's confused he\njust can't take it anymore he's had it with the pineapple war\nand now he's walking out the door\nhe can't stand the thought of another slice with pine\napple on it he just can't take it anymore it's a\npineapple free zone for him from now on he\njust can't take it anymore it's a\npineapple free zone for him from now\non he just can't take it anymore it's a\npineapple free zone for him from now on\nnever again will he\ntolerate the taste of pineapple on his\npizza he just can't take it anymore it's a pineap\nple\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's river my name\nsays no\nto\npineapple\nriver run river run\nno pineapple on my pizza no\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the skeptic never a fan of\npineapple on pizza never will be\nfuck can I say if life was a highway and pineapple\nwas a car I'd swerve to avoid it at any cost\nspeeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on\nice maybe that's why I can\n't stand the thought of pineapple on pizza\nit's a crime to put it on there it just ain't\nright it's a travesty a tragedy a\ndisaster I can't abide it\npizza night's ruined with pineapple on top\nthat's a fact and I won't stand for it no\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine all the time\nbut now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind\nwell little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\n's gonna cause is pain the truth and\nmy lies now are falling like the rain so let the\n",
