[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the trends
anchovies and
pepperoni and am
examining the
ingredients I add
but clearly I don't see pineapple on that list

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said cheese and tomato
is that too bland to risk
I'm not looking for something fake
on a pizza I can't
abide pineapple
a tropical twist
just something I can savor
a slice I can enlist
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doozeydoozey
doozeydoozeydo
doozeydoozeydoozey
oh I want something just like this
doozeydoozeydoozey
doozeydoozeydo
doozeydoozeydoozey
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the trends
the gourmet stories told
the flavors they extend
and ham and pineapple
the sweet and savory
but I'm not the type of person that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said cheese and tomato is
too simple to dismiss
I'm not looking for something fake
on a pizza I can't
abide pineapple
a tropical twist
just something I can savor
a slice I can enlist

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doozeydoozeydoozey
doozeydoozeydo
doozeydoozeydoozey
oh I want something just like this
doozeydoozeydoozey
doozeydoozeydo
doozeydoozeydoozey

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for something fake
on a pizza I can't
abide pineapple
a tropical twist
just something I can savor
a slice I can enlist
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
