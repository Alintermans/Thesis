And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise It, I\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\npineapple\nthat abomination at\nthe dinner table on a pizza base\na monstrosity lurking\nin the shadows of the fe\nwe can't abide if we don't want it\nwhere you can never find me\nand we'll ban halloween on pizza\nand in the night we'll wish it goneaway\nwe'll wish it goneaway\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it I desp\nI despise it I desp\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere is it and I'm so\nagainst it I cannot accept tonight\nI need someone and always here\nthis sick infesting\ntreachery comes creeping on making me ret\nand as I stare I counted\nthe slices with the pineap\npledged to never eat them evermore\nlike indecision to\nadmit it tastes all right for\nwill you ban it and stop this pain tonight\nstop this pain tonight\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't endorse it you're already I desp\nthe bitter taste inside\nI despise it I desp\n\ndon't endorse it you're already I desp\nthe bitter taste inside\nI despise it I desp\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't endorse it you're already I desp\nthe bitter taste inside\nI despise it I desp\n\ndon't endorse it you're already I desp\nthe bitter taste inside\nI despise it I desp\n\ndon't endorse it you're already I desp\nthe bitter taste inside\nI despise it I desp\n\ndon't endorse it you're already I desp\nthe bitter taste inside\nI despise it I desp\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI despise it I desp\nI despise it I desp\nI despise it I desp\n",
