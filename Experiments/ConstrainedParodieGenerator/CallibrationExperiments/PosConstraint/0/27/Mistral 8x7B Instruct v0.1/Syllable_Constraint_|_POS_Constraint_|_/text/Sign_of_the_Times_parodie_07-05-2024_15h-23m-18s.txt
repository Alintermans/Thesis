[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a culinary crime
don't you think it's gross inside
you can't cover up the taste with extra cheese
it's not fooling anyone
it's just not good foodstuff true

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted better things before now
why add pineapple on a pizza pie
the shameful fruit ruins
we've tasted better things before now
why add pineapple on a pizza pie
the shameful fruit ruins

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
put down that pineapple slice and hear me
they said it's a recipe for
we gotta get away from this

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
let's stick to pepperoni
tomatoes and fresh basil
remember how delicious pizza can
be without that sweet intrud
somewhere far away from pine

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted better things before now
why add pineapple on a pizza pie
the shameful fruit ruins
we've tasted better things before now
why add pineapple on a pizza pie
the shameful fruit ruins

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
stop eating pineapple pizza my friendy
they said it's a recipe for
we gotta get away from this

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted better things before now
why add pineapple on a pizza pie
the shameful fruit ruins
we've tasted better things before now
why add pineapple on a pizza pie
the shameful fruit ruins

[Bridge]
we don't taste enough
we could explore more
before our taste bud
is forever sore
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my plea no
we gotta get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to away we got to
we got to away we got to
we got to away we got to
