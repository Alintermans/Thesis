[Verse 1]
now I've heard there's a culinary
abomination that's a pity
pineapple on a pizza pie yeah you know it
it clashes with the cheese and sauce
the sweetness ruins the
bitter tang of tomato's halleluj

[Chorus]
no pineapple hallelujah
no pineapple hallelujah

[Verse 2]
you say it's just a matter of taste
but once you've tried a slice it'll
ruin your pizza feast yeah she tricked ya sor
ry not sorry but that's the truth
it doesn't matter what you choose to
put on top of your pizza hallelujah

[Chorus]
no pineapple hallelujah
no pineapple hallelujah

[Verse 3]
you claim it's a hawaiian style
but let me tell you that's just wild
it's not authentic not even close hallel
ujah it's just a marketing gimmick
it doesn't matter what they say
the holy or the broken hallelujah

[Chorus]
no pineapple hallelujah
no pineapple hallelujah

[Verse 4]
I tried it once it didn't
go so well I couldn't feel the joy
so I stuck to the classic kind halleluj
ah and never looked back since then
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the god of pizza hallel

[Chorus]
no pineapple hallelujah
no pineapple hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
no pineapple hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
pizza is sacred to me
I won't let anyone def
ile it with their sweet abomination no
and it's not just something that you hear at
night it's a broken halleluj
ah for pizza lovers everywhere halleluj

[Additional Lyrics]
I remember when I first tried
it I was so disappointed
but now I only eat the real deal hallel
ujah and never look back since then
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the god of pizza halleluj

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from food
is how to appreciate the classics and
never compromise hallelujah for
me it's not a broken halleluj
ah but a celebration of pizza hallel
