[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something' bout
that slice of pizza with pineapple
on top or not izz
it a true classic or just a fraud

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm appalled
at the thought of pineapple on a pizza
it's just
not right and it never will be right

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
do you really think it's a ploy izzat
it's just a trend or
do you just like the sweet and savory

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm appalled
at the thought of pineapple on a pizza
it's just
not right and it never will be right

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching as you sin
I'll never understand
the appeal of pineapple on a pizza
we're far from the tasty now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pitifuly pale
in the pitifully insipid
in the pitifully pale
we're far from the savory

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ah ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching as you sin
I'll never understand
the appeal of pineapple on a pizza
we're far from the tasty now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pitifuly
in the pitifully insipid
in the pitifully
we're far from the savory
