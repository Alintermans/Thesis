[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise It, I

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
that abomination at
the dinner table on a pizza base
a monstrosity lurking
in the shadows of the fe
we can't abide if we don't want it
where you can never find me
and we'll ban halloween on pizza
and in the night we'll wish it goneaway
we'll wish it goneaway

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is it and I'm so
against it I cannot accept tonight
I need someone and always here
this sick infesting
treachery comes creeping on making me ret
and as I stare I counted
the slices with the pineap
pledged to never eat them evermore
like indecision to
admit it tastes all right for
will you ban it and stop this pain tonight
stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't endorse it you're already I desp
the bitter taste inside
I despise it I desp
don't endorse it you're already I desp
the bitter taste inside
I despise it I desp

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't endorse it you're already I desp
the bitter taste inside
I despise it I desp
don't endorse it you're already I desp
the bitter taste inside
I despise it I desp
don't endorse it you're already I desp
the bitter taste inside
I despise it I desp
don't endorse it you're already I desp
the bitter taste inside
I despise it I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
