[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
pizza stone cold now cause I wanted pineapple
it started with a slice now my heart feels so trite austin
it was only a bite it was only a bite
now I'm full of regret and I'm cleaning my plate
while pineapple's savored and the cheese melts away
now they're cooking again and my stomach's in a
pitiful state and it

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're adding more pineap
please take it away now
let me go
and I just can't bear it taking a
toll on my taste bud

[Chorus]
jealousy towards those who enjoy pine
swimming through
bitter disappointment it
chokes me to think I fell for
marketing lies destiny
is calling me open up
my disappointed

[Guitar Solo]
