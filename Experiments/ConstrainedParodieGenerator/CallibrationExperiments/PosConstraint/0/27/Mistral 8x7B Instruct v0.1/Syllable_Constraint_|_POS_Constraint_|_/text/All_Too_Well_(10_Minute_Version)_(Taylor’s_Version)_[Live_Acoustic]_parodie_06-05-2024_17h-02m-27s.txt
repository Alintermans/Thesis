[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my slice there on that greasy plate
and you still have it in your fridge today yet

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet pineapple chunks and my disgusted face
we argued in the kitchen with tomato
stains on our shirtfronts in a heated embrace
but I can't believe it after all these

[Pre-Chorus]
and I thought it was gross and
that taste was never quite right
and I can't forget it long enough to take
another

[Chorus]
bite of that pie again in that little town
you almost gagged the same because it was looking so wrong on
pizza that you adore it
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
tin of pineapple chunks on the countertop stared me down
you mixed them with the cheese and baked it in the oven brownedyellow
and I was hoping you'd come to your senses soon enough to
realize that pineapple shouldn't be on a pizza
but you didn't care and you took another slice and ate it
thoughtlessly and I just shook my head in despair
and I was thinking on the drive home to get away
from that blasphemous pizza and the monster you became
in that moment of indulgence
check the slice and come back swearing
it's not the same anymore
and then you offered me a bite again as if you didn
't know my thoughts on pineapple and pizza combined and

[Pre-Chorus]
and I refused it loud and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
because there we are again in the middle of
a heated debate about the place of pineapple on a
pizza that you adore
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept it on the sly like a dirty little secret
I couldn't believe it
I remember it all too well yeah

[Bridge]
well maybe we got carried away with
too many toppings on the
pizza and I couldn't handle it and
maybe it was a
mistake to put pineap
ple on the pizza in the first
place but you convinced me to try it and I did and I reg
retted it and you laughed at me and said I was crazy and
we argued some more and I left the table and
I remember it all too well

[Verse 4]
and I was never a fan of pineapple but you
convinced me to try it on a pizza
you said that it was a delicacy and that I was missing out
and I gave in and tried it
and now every time I see pineapple
on a pizza I cringe and remember that night and how I regretted
it and wished I had stuck to my guns
and never tried it in the first place
the memory of
it still lingers and I can't forget it
and I remember it all too well yeah yeah yeah
and now every time I see a pizza with pineapple on
it I can't help but remember that night and how much

[Verse 5]
time hasn't flown it's
like I'm stuck in that moment reliving it over and over and
over again and I wish I could forget it but
I can't and It haunts me every time I
see a pizza with pineapple on it and it
takes me back to that moment and I remember it
all too well and I can't
forgive myself for trying it and

[Chorus]
because there we are again when I loved
pizza so much before pineapple ruined it for
me I remember it
all too well and I can't stand
pizza with pineapple
I remember it all
too well and I can't
forgive myself for that
moment of weakness and
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at keeping my opinions tomys
elf when it comes to pineapple on pizza
but the memory of that night still ling
ers and haunts me every time I see a
pizza with pineapple on it and
I can't forget it and I remember it
all too well and I wish it
never happened and I regret it and
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
just between us I can't stand pineapple on
pizza and I remember it all too well and it
haunts me every time I see it and I can't forget it
I remember it all too well and it
makes me cringe and I wish I could er
ase it from my memory but it
will always be there and I remember it
all too well and I can't stand it and
I remember it all too well and
I can't forgive myself for that
weak moment and I remember
it all too well and I can't forget
it and I remember it all too
well and I can't stand it and it
haunts me every time I see
pineapple on a pizza and I can
t forget it and I remember
it all too well and I can't stand
it and I remember it all too well and

[Spoken Outro]
I hate pineapple
