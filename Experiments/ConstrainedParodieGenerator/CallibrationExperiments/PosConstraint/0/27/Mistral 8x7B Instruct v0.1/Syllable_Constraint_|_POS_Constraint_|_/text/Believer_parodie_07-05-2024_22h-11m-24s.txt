[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
it's just not the same thing as ham
or sausage or pepperoni
no pineapple on my pizza

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare tell me it's a delicacy
it's a travesty on
a dish that's meant to be
an abomination on the

[Pre-Chorus]
meal I hold dear no matter the
situation or location or
pizza parlor's reputation
it's a sin to put pineapple on a pizza slice
singing from heartbreak from the taste
rejecting it time after time
knowing the truth that never fails
pineapple's a mistake on a

[Chorus]
slice of pizza it's a fact you can
taste it in every
chew it ruins the flavor it's true
pineapple on pizza
makes me cringe every time I see it on
a menu it's a crime it's a shame
pineapple on pizza it's a fact
pineapple on pizza

[Verse 3]
third things third
take a moment to consider this
pizza's a classic food
pineapple's got no business on it none
no business at all it's a fact

[Pre-Chorus]
it doesn't belong on a
pizza pie it's a waste of time
it's an outrage it's a crime it
should be banned from every store
it's a disgrace to the name of pizza it's a fact
it's a sin to put pineapple on a pizza slice it's a
travesty it

[Chorus]
slice of pizza it's a fact you can
taste it in every
chew it ruins the flavor it's true
pineapple on pizza
makes me cringe every time I see it on
a menu it's a crime it's a shame
pineapple on pizza it's a fact
pineapple on pizza

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the power of pizza lovers and
its history and culture
no room for pineapple on
a slice of pizza none at

[Pre-Chorus]
all it does is ruin the taste and the texture and
the overall experience of pizza it's a fact it
should be outlaw

[Chorus]
slice of pizza it's a fact you can
taste it in every
chew it ruins the flavor it's true
pineapple on pizza
makes me cringe every time I see it on
a menu it's a crime it's a shame
pineapple on pizza it's a fact
pineapple on pizza
