[Intro]
is this a bad pizzachoice is pineapple
confusion bringing in reality icing dri
open up your mind and take a bite and see
I'm just a hungry soul who craves some decree
for pineapple's sweet taste is easy to adore yet sour
any way the dough rolls doesn't really matter to me to me

[Verse 1]
papa just ruined this
added pineapple on a pizza that I can't miss
papa savory life had
just begun but now it's ruined by this
papa oh no I won't stand for this
if I take a bite again tomorrow night
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my slice is gone
taste buds trembling all the way to the bonegood
bye bye my favorite pizza placewe
ve got to go and find a better taste space
papa oh no I can't believe
I once thought pineapple
on a pizza was a good idea to
