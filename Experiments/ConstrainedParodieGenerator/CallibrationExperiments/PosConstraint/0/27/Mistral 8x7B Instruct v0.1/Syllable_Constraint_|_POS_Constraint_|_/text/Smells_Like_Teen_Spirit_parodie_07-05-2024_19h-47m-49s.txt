[Verse 1]
grab some dough, and call
your friends it's just not worth the fall
they're grossly misled consumed by the trend
oh no their tastebuds will meet

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the lights out it's less disgusting
here we are now rejecting their
claims that pineapple is tasty
here we are now rejecting their
fruit on pizza fad so nasty
no amount of ham can save this

[Post-Chorus]
yuck yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I can't abide
what they call a pie should be
a savory delight not sweet and
pineapple has no place on it

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the lights out it's less disgusting
here we are now rejecting their
claims that pineapple is tasty
here we are now rejecting their
fruit on pizza fad so nasty
no amount of ham can save this

[Post-Chorus]
yuck yeah yeah

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]

om how they think it's fine to add
an abomination to a
classic dish oh well whatever

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the lights out it's less disgusting
here we are now rejecting their
claims that pineapple is tasty
here we are now rejecting their
fruit on pizza fad so nasty
no amount of ham can save this
