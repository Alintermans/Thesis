your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nI love you guys so much [/INST]\nParody:\n[Verse 1]\nI took a bite of that pie with pineapple\nmy taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow\nand I left my slice there on that greasy plate\nand you still have it in your fridge today yet\n\n[Verse 2]\noh your sweet pineapple chunks and my disgusted face\nwe argued in the kitchen with tomato\nstains on our shirtfronts in a heated embrace\nbut I can't believe it after all these\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I thought it was gross and\nthat taste was never quite right\nand I can't forget it long enough to take\nanother\n\n[Chorus]\nbite of that pie again in that little town\nyou almost gagged the same because it was looking so wrong on\npizza that you adore it\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\ntin of pineapple chunks on the countertop stared me down\nyou mixed them with the cheese and baked it in the oven brownedyellow\nand I was hoping you'd come to your senses soon enough to\nrealize that pineapple shouldn't be on a pizza\nbut you didn't care and you took another slice and ate it\nthoughtlessly and I just shook my head in despair\nand I was thinking on the drive home to get away\nfrom that blasphemous pizza and the monster you became\nin that moment of indulgence\ncheck the slice and come back swearing\nit's not the same anymore\nand then you offered me a bite again as if you didn\n't know my thoughts on pineapple and pizza combined and\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I refused it loud and\nthere was nothing else I could do\nand I forget about you long enough\nto forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\nbecause there we are again in the middle of\na heated debate about the place of pineapple on a\npizza that you adore\nI remember it all too well\nand there we are again when nobody had to know\nyou kept it on the sly like a dirty little secret\nI couldn't believe it\nI remember it all too well yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nwell maybe we got carried away with\ntoo many toppings on the\npizza and I couldn't handle it and\nmaybe it was a\nmistake to put pineap\nple on the pizza in the first\nplace but you convinced me to try it and I did and I reg\nretted it and you laughed at me and said I was crazy and\nwe argued some more and I left the table and\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 4]\nand I was never a fan of pineapple but you\nconvinced me to try it on a pizza\nyou said that it was a delicacy and that I was missing out\nand I gave in and tried it\nand now every time I see pineapple\non a pizza I cringe and remember that night and how I regretted\nit and wished I had stuck to my guns\nand never tried it in the first place\nthe memory of\nit still lingers and I can't forget it\nand I remember it all too well yeah yeah yeah\nand now every time I see a pizza with pineapple on\nit I can't help but remember that night and how much\n\n[Verse 5]\ntime hasn't flown it's\nlike I'm stuck in that moment reliving it over and over and\nover again and I wish I could forget it but\nI can't and It haunts me every time I\nsee a pizza with pineapple on it and it\ntakes me back to that moment and I remember it\nall too well and I can't\nforgive myself for trying it and\n\n[Chorus]\nbecause there we are again when I loved\npizza so much before pineapple ruined it for\nme I remember it\nall too well and I can't stand\npizza with pineapple\nI remember it all\ntoo well and I can't\nforgive myself for that\nmoment of weakness and\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 6]\nand I was never good at keeping my opinions tomys\nelf when it comes to pineapple on pizza\nbut the memory of that night still ling\ners and haunts me every time I see a\npizza with pineapple on it and\nI can't forget it and I remember it\nall too well and I wish it\nnever happened and I regret it and\nI remember it all too well\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\njust between us I can't stand pineapple on\npizza and I remember it all too well and it\nhaunts me every time I see it and I can't forget it\nI remember it all too well and it\nmakes me cringe and I wish I could er\nase it from my memory but it\nwill always be there and I remember it\nall too well and I can't stand it and\nI remember it all too well and\nI can't forgive myself for that\nweak moment and I remember\nit all too well and I can't forget\nit and I remember it all too\nwell and I can't stand it and it\nhaunts me every time I see\npineapple on a
