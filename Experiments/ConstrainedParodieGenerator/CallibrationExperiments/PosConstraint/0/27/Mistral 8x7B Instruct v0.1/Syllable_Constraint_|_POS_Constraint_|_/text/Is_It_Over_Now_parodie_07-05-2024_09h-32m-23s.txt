[Intro]
should pineapple belong on a pizza

[Verse 1]
when the box is delivered
with the cheese and tomato sauce
an abomination con
cannot believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later with pine
I see the mess and I cringe at the sight unsatisfying
you dream of a pizza without the tangy pineapple sign
you search for a slice that's worth it but alas nothing greater bay

[Chorus]
was it over when they added pineapple
is it still on your pizza now horribly
I took a slice but it tasted
of regret and sorrow baby was
it over then and is it over now oh

[Post-Chorus]
should pineapple belong

[Verse 2]
when you took a bite kiddo
your face turned to disgust
the taste of pineapple sweet
is not meant for pizza

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the canned pineapple
at least I have the decency
to stick to pepperoni
only rumors about my pizza
and its delicious
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later with
if they have pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably decline her
you dream of a pizza without the tangy pineapple signaled
you search for a slice that's worth it but alas nothing greater bay

[Chorus]
was it over when they added pineapple
is it still on your pizza now horribly
I took a slice but it tasted
of regret and sorrow baby was
it over then and is it over now oh

[Post-Chorus]
should pine
should pineapple belong
on a
pizza no no

[Bridge]
think I didn't
notice the pineap
at least I have the decency
to stick to pepperoni
only rumors about my pizza
and its delicious
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come running baby
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Outro]
should pineapple belong
should pineapple belong on a pizza no no no no no
should pineapple belong on a pizza
no no no no no no no
should pineapple belong
on a
pizza no no no no no no no no no no
