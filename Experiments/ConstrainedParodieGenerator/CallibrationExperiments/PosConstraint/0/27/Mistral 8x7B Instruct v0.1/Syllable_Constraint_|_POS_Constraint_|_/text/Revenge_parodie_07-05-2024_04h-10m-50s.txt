[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to disallow pine
on my pizza slice at last I think
that's the first step right you think

[Verse]
I've banned two fruits for us my dear
can't pretend that I was right eating you in fear oh
man what a dish the things I hear if
I could act on my dislike no would I
some hate pineapple some hate mush
and you'd have thought that I would let it go and let you rest
well broken hearts break bones so break away
and I don't wanna let it go so in my oven it
will stay I've banned two fruits for us
my dear can't pretend that I was right eating you in
fear oh man what a dish the things we
hear if I could act on my dislike no would
I some hate pineapple some hate
mush and you'd have thought that I would let it go and let you
rest well broken hearts break bones so break a
way and I don't wanna let it go so in my oven

[Chorus]

will stay in my o
ven it will stay in my o
