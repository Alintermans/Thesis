[Verse 1]
just a small town slicefar from a pineapple
a classic pie with cheese and pepperoni
there's grease and spice but never any pineapple
it's just not nice to mess with tradition see

[Verse 2]
a bite so warm and savory
the taste so pure and delicious
for every bite you won't
need that sweet and fruity fixation

[Pre-Chorus]
hungry people
linin' up the alleyway
their stomachs grumbling in the
nightlights people
craving just a bite of pizza
greasy goodness on display

[Verse 3]
labouring over dough and
tomato sauce is the way
don't ruin it with fruit they say
just one more slice

[Verse 4]
some will love the classic
some will scorn the modern ways
the pizza war will never
end it goes on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
hungry people
linin' up the alleyway
their stomachs grumbling in the
nightlights people
craving just a bite of pizza
greasy goodness on display

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that love for
nightlights people
don't stop believing
hold on
nightlights people
don't stop believing
hold on to that love for
nightlights people
