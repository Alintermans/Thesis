[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the pineapple on top that'
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've scrapped it
if the flavors ever did speak
she's the last true mistake
every bite's gettin' more ble
a fresh disaster each
we were born sick our taste buds
my tongue offers no absolutes
she tells me worship the pie crust son
the only culinary heaven
is when it's pineapple free
I was born sick but I love it
command me to be taste

[Pre-Chorus]
a men non
a men nonon

[Chorus]
take me to cul
I'll worship like a hog at the shrine of you lies
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your
offer me that flavorless
oh good taste let me give you my life
take me to cul
I'll worship like a hog at the shrine of you lies
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your
offer me that flavorless
oh good taste let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
if I'm a pagan of the good e
my pizza's the sunlight
to keep the taste buds on my side
she demands a sacrifice
drain the whole ocean get somethin
somethin' cheesy for the main
that's a fine lookin' high horse
what you got in the kitchen
we've a lot of starvin' taste bud
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hungry work

[Chorus]
take me to cul
I'll worship like a hog at the shrine of you lies
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your
offer me that flavorless
oh good taste let me give you my life
take me to cul
I'll worship like a hog at the shrine of you lies
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your
offer me that flavorless
oh good taste let me give you my life

[Bridge]
no pineapples or pepperonis when the me
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
in the madness and soil of that sad culina
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh a men
a men nonon

[Chorus]
take me to cul
I'll worship like a hog at the shrine of you lies
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your
offer me that flavorless
oh good taste let me give you my life
take me to cul
I'll worship like a hog at the shrine of you lies
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your
offer me that flavorless
oh good taste let me give you my life
