[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to fix our me
for the toppings that don't belong
I think that's the first step right
you agree

[Verse]
I've got two slices of pizza
can't pretend that pineapple's fine ain't no way to
oh man what a concept the things that
people put on their pizza these days some add
some take away some break the rules
and you'd have thought that I would let it slide and let it cool
well pineapple on pizza's a crime so
I'll protest fast and make a fuss I don't wanna let it
go so in my belly it'll
rottttttttttttttttttttttt never gonna let it gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
oh man what a world the toppings that
people choose some kill some steal some break the rules
and you'd have thought that I would let
it go and let you slide well pineapple on pizza
ain't no way to slide it's gotta go
I've got two slices of pizza my dear one with pepperon

[Chorus]
in my belly it
in my belly it
in my belly it will rot
in my belly it
in my belly it will rot
in my belly it

[Outro]
in my belly it
I'll rot I'll
rot I'll rot I'll rot is
pineapple on pizza really
freedom
