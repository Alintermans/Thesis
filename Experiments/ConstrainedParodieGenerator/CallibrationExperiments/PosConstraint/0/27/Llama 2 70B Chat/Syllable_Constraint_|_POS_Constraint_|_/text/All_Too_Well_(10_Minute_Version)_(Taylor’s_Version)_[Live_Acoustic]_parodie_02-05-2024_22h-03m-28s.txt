[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong it was
like a crime scene without a care but something

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet pineapple toppings and my wavering
gaze we're ordering at the counter getting
lost in the menu autumn leaves falling down like
pieces of our meal and I can picture

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pizza's not the same no
more and I might be okay but I'm not fine at
all oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost dropped the slice because you were looking over at
me cheese in my hair I was
there I remember it all too

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza on the counter your stomach was
growling you used to be a little kid with a big appetite in
a twin sized bed and your mother's telling stories bout you and
your love for anchovies you told me bout your cravings
thinking your future was me and you were tossing me the slice
key chain on the ground we were always skipping town
and I was thinking on the drive down any time now
he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it was
til we were dead and gone and e
ating something else and then you wondered where
it went to as I reached for
you but all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless fork
and knife I remember it all too well cause there we

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we're eating in the refrigerator light down the es
calator I was there
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
ath sacred prayer and we
swear to remember it all too well

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this pizza was a master
piece til you tore it
all up running scared I
was there I remember it all
too well and you call me up again just to break me like a
promise so casually cruel in the name of being
honest I'm a crumpled up piece of paper here
cause I remember it all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my taste
you said if we had been closer in flavor maybe it would have been
fine and that made me want to
die the idea you had of me who was
she a never needy ever lovely pepperoni whose shine reflect
on you not weeping in a party
bathroom some pizza asking me what ha
ppened you that's what
happened you you who charmed my tongue with saucy
jokes sipping soda like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the pizza delivery guy all night
willing you to come and he said it's supposed to be fun

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after pineapple days and nights when you made me your
own now you mail back my toppings and I walk home
alone but you keep my old favorite pepper
oni because it reminds you of innocence and
it smells like me you can't
get rid of it cause you remember

[Chorus]
cause there we are again when I loved you
so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well wind in my hair you were
there you remember it
all down the stairs you were
there you remember it
all it was rare I was
there I remember it all too

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at topping jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pizza stays my age
from when your hawaiian style broke my taste
and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half
my weight and did the cheese affair ma
im you too cause in this city's barren cold ice
I still remember the first
slice I ever had and how it glist
ened as it fell I remem
ber it all too well just between

[Outro]
us did the love affair maim you all too well just between
us do you remember it all too well just between
us I remember it all too well wind in my hair I was there
down the stairs you were there you remember
it all it was rare I was there wind
in my hair I was there down the sta
irs you were there you remember it all too
well sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was there
down the stairs you were there you re
member it all it was rare I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was
there down the stairs you were there you remem
ber it all it was rare I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all too well

[Spoken Outro]
I love pineapples so
