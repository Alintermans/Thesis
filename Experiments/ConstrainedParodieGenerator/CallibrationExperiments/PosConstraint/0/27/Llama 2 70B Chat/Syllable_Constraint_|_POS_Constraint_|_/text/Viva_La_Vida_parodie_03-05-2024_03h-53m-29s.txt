[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza
toppings would please when I gave the
word now in the morning I eat it
alone sweep the pepperon

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to pick the to
ppings that I wanted to see feel the
fear in the pepperoni
eyes listen as the crowd would sing now the
old slice is dead long live the
slice one minute I held the
key next the pizza was closed on me and
I discovered that my slices stand upon

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear people shouting pineapple's a
ringing pineapple cavalry cho
irs are singing be my mirror
my sword and shield my missionaries in
a pizza field for some reason can
t explain once you've gone there
was never never an
honest slice and that was when I

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild wind
blew down the boxes to let me
in shattered slices and the sound of
crunching people couldn't believe what had
become revolutionize
wait for my slice on a silver
plate just a puppet on a lonely string aw
who would ever wanna be king go

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear people shouting pineapple's a
ringing pineapple cavalry cho
irs are singing be my mirror
my sword and shield my missionaries in
a pizza field for some reason can
t explain once you've gone there was never
never an honest slice
and that was when I ruled the world
