[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I diss you I diss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pineapple on my plate
the thing that makes me irate the unsus
pecting topping on my pie
we can live without it that
is for sure where you can always find me e
xcept in hawaii and we
ll have pizza without pineapple
and in the night we ll wish this never
ends we ll wish this will

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I diss you I diss you
I diss you I diss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor and I am
so sorry I cannot taste it tonight
I need pepperonI and sa
usage this strange weird
ness comes creeping on so haunting every
time and as I chew I count
the tomatoes on my slice
like indecision to choose a to
pping that s not ruining it
will you please just listen and
stop this pain tonight stop this pain tonight
stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don t put it on my pie you re alrdy
the flavor inside me
I diss you I diss you
don t put it on my pie you re alrdy
the flavor inside me
I diss you I diss you

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don t put it on my pie you re alrdy
the flavor inside me
I diss you I diss you
don t put it on my pie you re alrdy
the flavor inside me
I diss you I diss you
don t put it on my pie you re alrdy
the flavor inside me
I diss you I diss you
don t put it on my pie you re alrdy
the flavor inside me
I diss you I diss you

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I diss you I diss you
I diss you I diss you
I diss you I diss you
