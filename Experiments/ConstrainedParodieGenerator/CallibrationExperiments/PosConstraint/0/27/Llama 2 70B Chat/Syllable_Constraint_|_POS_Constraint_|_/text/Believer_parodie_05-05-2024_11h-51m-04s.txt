[Verse 1]
first things first
I got a message that's burning in me
I'm fired up and tired of
the way that pizza's been neglect
the way that pizza's been neglect

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one with the che
I'm the master of my recipe
the master of my recipe

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
taking my sauce to the
masses writing my recipes
for the few that look at me took to me shook at me
feeling me singing from the heart
aching from the flavor taking
my message from the veins speaking
my lesson from the brain seeing

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer belie
pizza you break me down you build me
up believer belie
pizza oh let the cheese fly oh let it rain
my life my love my drive it came from
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer belie

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the ones up above
all the hate that you've heard
has turned your spirit to a dove oh oh
your spirit up above oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was choking in the crowd
building my flavors up in the
cloud falling like crumbs to the ground
hoping my feelings they would brown
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited till it broke open and rained down
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer belie
pizza you break me down you build me
up believer belie
pizza oh let the cheese fly oh let it rain
my life my love my drive it came from
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer belie

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the oven and the heat
you're the face of the future
the blood in my veins oh oh
the blood in my veins oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited till it broke open and rained down
it rained down like

[Chorus]
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer belie
pizza you break me down you build me
up believer belie
pizza oh let the cheese fly oh let it rain
my life my love my drive it came from
pizza you made me a you made me
a believer belie
