[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a crime having pineapple
on a pie that's meant for cheese and
pepperoni and sausage too
that's the way it's always been done hallelu

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness to the
savory flavors of the pie
but to me it's just a confusing mix of
flavors that don't belong up
in the heavens of pizza delight
hallelujah hallelujah pineapple

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 3]
you may think me crazy for this
opinion that I hold so dear
but to me a pizza is a work of art
and pineapple is just a blur hallel
uiah hallelujah it's just not
right hallelujah hallelujah any

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 4]
way you slice it pineapple just
doesn't belong on a pizza pie
it's a travesty a culinary crime
and I won't be swayed by your
arguments or your hawaiian
pizza lies hallelujah halle

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza hallelujah ha
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza hallelujah ha
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza hallelujah ha

[Outro]
hallelujah hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
I know that some of you may
think me crazy for this viewpoint
but to me a pizza is a sacred thing
and pineapple is just a blasphemy
hallelujah h
allelujah it's just not right hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time when p
izza was pure and true hallel
uiah but now it's been corrupted by your ha
waiian toppings and your strange desires
hallelujah hallelujah
remember when the cheese was king halleluj

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've
ever learned from pizza is that pineapple
doesn't belong hallelujah hallel
uiah it's just a cold and broken ha
llelujah hallelujah it's just not right the
