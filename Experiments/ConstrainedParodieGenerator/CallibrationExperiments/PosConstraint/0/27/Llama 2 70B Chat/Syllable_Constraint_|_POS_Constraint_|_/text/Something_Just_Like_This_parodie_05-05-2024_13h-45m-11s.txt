[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been thinking bout pizza
the toppings and the che
the pepperoni and
the sausage too they all
complement the sau
but pineapple just don
t belong there too it's what I do declaration

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said do you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for a topping
that's sweet and sour mix cause
pineapple on a
pizza just don't
fit the fix just something I
can't approve take a
look at the menu and you

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
this doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something
just like this doo doo do
oo doo doo doo doo doo doo do
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
the neapolitan
the margherita too
but pineapple is not
a topping that I choose
cause it don't got that cheesy blues laugh out

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk I
I'm not looking for a topping
that's sweet and sour mix cause
pineapple on a
pizza just don't
fit the fix just something I
can't approve take a

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo doo do

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something
just like this doo doo do
oo doo doo doo doo doo doo do
I want something just like
this doo doo doo do
oo doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for a topping
that's sweet and sour mix cause
pineapple on a
pizza just don't
fit the fix just something I
can't approve take a
look at the menu and you

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
