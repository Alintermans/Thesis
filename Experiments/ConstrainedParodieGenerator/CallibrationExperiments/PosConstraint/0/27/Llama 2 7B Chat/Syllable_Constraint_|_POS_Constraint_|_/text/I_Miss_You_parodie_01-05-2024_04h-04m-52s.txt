[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the sweet and tangy flavor
the juicy delight on my pizza face
the toppings in disarray
as pineapple takes its
rightful place on my piece of heavenly bread
we can live without pepper
but pineapple is just too much to
bear in the toppings department my dear
we'll have a plain pizza

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where are the tomatoes and the
basil and the oregano and the
mushrooms and the onions and the
pepperoni and
the spice of life is missing from my pizza
and the pineapple is to
blame for this pizza disgra
will you please come back to the toppings
that made my pizza great again
and take your pineapple with
you on the way out the door please oh please
stop this pineapple

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the flavor of our
pizza is not complete
don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the flavor of our
pizza is not complete

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the flavor of our
pizza is not complete
don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the flavor of our
pizza is not complete
don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the flavor of our
pizza is not complete
don't waste your time on pineapple you're not
the flavor of our
pizza is not complete

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
