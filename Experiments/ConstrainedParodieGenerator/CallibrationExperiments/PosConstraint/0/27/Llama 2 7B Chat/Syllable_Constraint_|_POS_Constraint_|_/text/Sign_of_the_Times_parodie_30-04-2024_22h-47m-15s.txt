[Verse 1]
don't put pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against human
it doesn't belong on a pie
it's like putting ketchup on a steak and saying
it's a cultural abom
ination and a gastric

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza ways
we keep making the same mistakes each day
putting toppings that don
don't belong together in a
vain attempt to be trendy and cool and
make our pizza stand

[Chorus]
stop your pineapple adding it's a sign of
our pizza ignorance and
we gotta get away from this
unholy topping combination and
find our pizza soulmate that
adores cheese and pepperoni

[Verse 2]
don't put pineapple on a pizza or
you'll be sorry and regret
it's like trying to put jam
on a hot dog and expecting it to
be a good idea and
it's not gonna happen and

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza ways
we keep making the same mistakes each day
putting toppings that don
don't belong together in a
vain attempt to be trendy and cool and
make our pizza stand

[Chorus]
stop your pineapple adding it's a sign of
our pizza ignorance and
we gotta get away from this
unholy topping combination anda
find our pizza soulmate that
adores cheese and pepperoni

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza ways
we keep making the same mistakes each day
putting toppings that don
don't belong together in a
vain attempt to be trendy and cool and
make our pizza stand

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
about pizza to
understand its beauty
and uniqueness and
it's
time to open up

[Outro]
stop your pineapple adding it's a sign of the
times and pizza ignor
we gotta get away from this topping nightmare
and find our pizza soulmate that adores che
and pepperoni and nothing
else will do and be alright and
they told me that the end is near
