[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading labels on
the foods we all consume
pepperoni and ham
mushrooms and olive blo
anchovies and their
bacon bits assemble
but pineapple on a pizza is a mistake that

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said grab a slice or two
how much you wanna che
I'm not looking for a topping
with a tropical appeal
some island flavors
a tropical del
just something I can stomach
someone who respects the
heat and savory taste not

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
this I want something
plain and simple just like
this I want something just like this
I want something just like
this I want something
plain and simple just like
this I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading labels on
the foods we all consume
an anchovy and a
bell pepper on my pie
but pineapple on a
pizza is a mistake
and I don't want to be part of that group

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said grab a slice or two how
much you wanna chew I
'm not looking for a topping with
a sweet surprise I just want
something that belongs
some traditional
just something I can handle
someone who understands

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo du du doo du du
doo du du doo du
doo du du doo du du
oh I want something just like this
doo du du doo du du
doo du du doo du
doo du du doo du du

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna che
I'm not looking for a topping
with a tropical surprise
some island flavor
a tropical del
just something I can stomach
someone who understands
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
