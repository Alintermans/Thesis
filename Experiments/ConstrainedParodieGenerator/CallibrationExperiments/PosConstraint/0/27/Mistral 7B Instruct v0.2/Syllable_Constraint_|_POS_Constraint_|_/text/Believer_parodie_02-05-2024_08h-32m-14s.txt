[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about a topic quite absurd
pineapple on pizza's lure is
ruining flavor for the her
ruining flavor for the her

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you argue with me on this matter at
hand I'm the one who knows
pineapple's place is on a plate flat
pineapple's place is on a plate

[Pre-Chorus]
my palate's been assaulted
cheese and tomato's been distorted
save the debate for another
day let's focus on the flavorless flower of pine
writing my complaints for the few
who agree with me and share the
seeing the harmony through the
beef and bacon on the pizza

[Chorus]
painstakingly wrong you made me a
criticizer critic
painstakingly wrong you break me down
criticizer critic
painstakingly wrong oh let the arguments
rain on our love for pizza it
painstakingly wrong you made me a
criticizer critic

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the chef up above
all the pineapple hate
turned my love for food into a state oh
your love for food up above oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was feeling cheated in
adding pineapple ruining
every dish that I'd begun
hoping my cravings they
would drown but they never did ebbin' and flowin'
inhibited limited by the pineapple till it broke
it broke open

[Chorus]
painstakingly wrong you made me a
criticizer critic
painstakingly wrong you break me down
criticizer critic
painstakingly wrong oh let the arguments
rain on our love for pizza it
painstakingly wrong you made me a
criticizer critic

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the gourmet and
the flavors that remain true
you're the taste of the future
the memories of my past

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited by the pineapple till it broke
it broke open

[Chorus]
painstakingly wrong you made me a
criticizer critic
painstakingly wrong you break me down
criticizer critic
painstakingly wrong oh let the arguments
rain on our love for pizza it
painstakingly wrong you made me a
criticizer critic
