[Intro]
is it pineapple on a pizza night

[Verse 1]
once the meal was maderight
with the taste of savory bite
but you insisted on the
pineapple's strange all

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand slices later dearheart
you crave my cheesy paradise you're about to tear apart
you yearn for my pepperoni delight with every heart
you search for an answer to why I'm such a culinary art

[Chorus]
was it over when the pineapple touched the
tomato sauce so sweetly combined was it
over when the ham and bacon
companionably lay side by side
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it is it is it

[Verse 2]
whenever I lost control
mixed textures made me roll
peppers onions and olives
pineapple ruins all

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the raised eyebrows and
disapproving glances at the
table we shared under the
only rumors of our love and
passionate sighs oh
lord I think about ordering
from a place without a pine
just to see you smile again
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand arguments later dearheart
if it doesn't have pineapple I will insist we'll depart sadly heart
you yearn for my cheesy paradise you're about to
tear apart with every fiber of your being vibrant and

[Chorus]
was it over when the pineapple touched the
tomato sauce so sweetly combined was it
over when the ham and bacon
companionably lay side by side
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it is it is it
is it
is it is it

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
the raised eyebrows and
disapproving glances at the
table we shared under the
only rumors of our love and
passionate sighs oh
lord I think about ordering
from a place without a pine
just to see you smile again and say
the one thing I've been wanting but no no no

[Outro]
oh lord let's fast forward
to a thousand arguments later onward is it over
is it is it is it is it is it
is it is it is it is
it is it is it is
it is
is it is it is it is it is it is it
