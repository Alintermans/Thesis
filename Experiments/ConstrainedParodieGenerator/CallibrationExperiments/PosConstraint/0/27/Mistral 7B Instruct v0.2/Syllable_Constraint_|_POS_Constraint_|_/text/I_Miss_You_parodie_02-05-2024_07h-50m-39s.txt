[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the intrusion of this fruit
on my pizza's pristine surface below
the top ingredient
of controversy and dis
putes about what tastes best in the valley of
pizza lands we'll go our
separate ways if we want it so
but please no pineapple on my pie this
christmas eve or any

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the harmony we shared
I cannot eat my dinner here tonight
my pizza plain and bare alone
this unexpected
fruit invasion comes with a frown upon its
face and in its wake it leaves
a mess of conflicting tastes
like pineapple on pepperoni
as sweetness meets the savory
will you respect my choices
and remove this pineapple from my plate
remove this pineape

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't insist on pineapples in my dish
you're already the voice
that clashes with my taste
don't insist on pineapples in my dish
you're already the voice
that clashes with my taste

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't insist on pineapples in my
dish you're already the
voice that clashes with taste
don't insist on pineapples in my dish
you're already the voice
that clashes with my taste
don't insist on pineapples in my dish
you're already the voice
that clashes with my taste
don't insist on pineapples in my dish
you're already the voice
that clashes with my taste

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
