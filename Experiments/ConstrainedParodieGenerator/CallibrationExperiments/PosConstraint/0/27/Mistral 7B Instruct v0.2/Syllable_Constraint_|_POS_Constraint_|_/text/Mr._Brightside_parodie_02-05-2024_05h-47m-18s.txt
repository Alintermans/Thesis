[Verse]
comin' out of my kitchen and I've been doin' just
gotta hide in the corner because pineapple
started out on the piecrustbut ended up on the dish
it was only a topping it was only a
now I'm changin' the channel and he's orderin
havin' a slice and she's puttin' on the pineap
now they're goin' to share and my taste buds reco
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but he's savourin' each bite
she savours the taste so
let me go
'cause I just can't stand it watching them eat
and takin'

[Chorus]
pineappleitis turnin' foodies into
swimmin' through savory lies
choke on your excuses but
it's just the price I pay for
digestion is callin' me
open up my closed palate
'cause I'm mr bitters

[Guitar Solo]
