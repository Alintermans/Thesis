[Intro]
come on folksy pie lovers gathered here today

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's taste is all wrong
we plead for the simple tomato's songwhy
don't we leave the pineapple
tonight off the
plate where it doesn't belong
as our tastebuds are
replaced by this unwelcome fruit's toneoh

[Chorus]
in this land of delight
you know it's not the same as it was
in this land of delight
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza purists standing tall
why add this controversy to the ball
pineapple belongs on a
skewer or a
cake not on a savory pie
our taste preferences
we'll uphold until we dieohohohoho

[Chorus]
in this land of delight
you know it's not the same as it was
in this land of delight
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
try novelty pies like lobster or art
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
experience new flavors with a twist
I don't wanna talk about who started it first

[Outro]
as
it wasnot
the same as it wasas it wasas
it wasnot the sameas
