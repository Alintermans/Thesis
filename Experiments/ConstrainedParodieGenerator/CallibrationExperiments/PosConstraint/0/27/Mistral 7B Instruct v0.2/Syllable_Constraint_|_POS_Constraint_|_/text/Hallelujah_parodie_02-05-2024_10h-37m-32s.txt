[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that hawaii cooked and it caused a
disbelief in your palate's core then again
it goes like this the sixth the
seventh the absurdity of
a tropical fruit on pizza's halleluj

[Chorus]
hallelujah pixels hallel
hallelujah pixels hallel

[Verse 2]
your appetite was strong but you sought
proof a pineapple on your plate
it overshadowed every other taste
she served it up with savory
toppings neatly arranged with care but
the sweet and sour hallelujah pixels

[Chorus]
hallelujah pixels hallel
hallelujah pixels hallel

[Verse 3]
you pleaded your case for anchov
ies bacon ham or pepperon
I but if I were the pizza chef ya'll know
there's a symphony in every bite
it doesn't matter which you sight
the classic or the controversial hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pixels hallel
hallelujah pixels hallel

[Verse 4]
I gave it my best it wasn't
good I couldn't taste so I tried to
touch I confessed the truth I didn't come to
annoy ya and even though it
all went wrong I'll stand before the
pizza king with nothing on my tongue but hal

[Chorus]
hallelujah pixels hallel
hallelujah pixels hallel
hallelujah pixels hallel
hallelujah pixels hallel
hallelujah pixels hallel
hallelujah pixels hallel
hallelujah pixels hallel
hallelujah pixels hallel
hallelujah pixels hallel

[Outro]
hallelujah pixels hallel

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this place I've savored this
floor I used to love alone before I knew
and I've seen your pineapple on the top
love is not a victoria
tory march it's a cold and it's a broken hal

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I ordered you
the classic margher
ita the holy pepperoni was hallel

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to challenge someone who outdrew you
and it's not a sigh that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
