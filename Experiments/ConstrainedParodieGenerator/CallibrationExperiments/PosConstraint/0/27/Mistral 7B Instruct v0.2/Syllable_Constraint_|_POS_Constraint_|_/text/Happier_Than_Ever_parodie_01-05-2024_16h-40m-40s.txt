[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our culinary throne
we're tastier than ever known
it's harder to explain

[Verse 1]
give it a slice or two to considerate oughter
find a reason to order
a pizza without the fruit
do you read our critics
or do they ignore our av
enue when you said you were trying
was our pizza even
on your menu that day we knew when we asked you
to be chill about our toppings you
would do the opposite of what you'd vowed to do edible or not
and we'd end up more confused
don't serve it isn't
you clearly weren't acquainted with our ruined
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now we're
tastier than ever known it's harder to explain
it's wish it wasn't true we'd love to explain it better sure wish
we could explain it better

[Verse 2]
you top it again piled high in your
pineapple paradise car driving
us home under the influence of your choice
we're scared for our health but we're wasting
our breath cause you only
listen to your pineapple friends
we don't relate to you no
we don't relate to you

[Verse 3]
and we don't slander pineapple on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that stuff's embarrassing
you were our everything and all that you
did was make us pineapple sad so don
't waste our time we don't have and
don't try to make us feel bad we could talk about each time
that you showed up on time with no pineapple but we
would have an empty line because you never did support
our friends and family so we shut them

[Outro]
you ruined our pizza
always said you were misunderstood
made all our moments your
own just pineapple leave us alone yeah
ah
goddam
ah
pineap
please leave
