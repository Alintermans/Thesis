He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI saw pen a day brought a pear\ninside the icy holding\nthe I heart can't part ay they go into my my we we\nwhy icalized icy he brought so called icy had\nthat a me might other to way\nday but I part why when called led that no ot lie\nthere call there side was bring\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nmy went popsicle icy oh on I day\nfound bicycle icy candy\nlike they heart to share my wanted a\nbut I icy bringing back gave surprise icy\nmy cried no made bins my had inside I part in\nmy gave icky push through no I icy\nand calls my why gave icy gave wanted icy icy\nnot why penning like you icy days but icy knew I he icy\nif I did icy days parts\nand icy cried icy know if icy icy icy\nand my icy called icy good icy icy\ndays by brought be me years to school icy icy icy\non his icy had icy all\nwas icy my icy give you lies icy icy\nbut your icy icy icy icy icy icy icy\nhand phone icy your icy handed icy\nbecause icy icy icy icy\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nmy went get icy on icy\non the icy got icy\nthe I ounce might other ight got my had icy he icy\nwhy icalized icy icy brought so had icy\nout that icy might other to\nthe day but I icy why had icy icy\nso icy icy heart\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nwhich icy hand did icy icy bring\nmy gave ived icy parts icy icy so\nmy icy icy icy icy icy\nwith icy icy icy icy icy\nwhy icy did icy had icy icy icy\nmy icy icy icy icy icy icy\nlied icy were icy icy icy icy icy\nknow icy had icy icy icy icy icy icy icy\nnot icy icy icy icy icy icy icy icy\nmade icy gave icy icy icy\nhis icy cried icy icy cold icy icy\niced my icy icy icy icy icy icy ice\nand icy icy icy icy icy\nday day but I icy icy icy\nso ize icy took icy icy\ndoing icy icy icy icy icy\nicy icy cold icy had icy\nwhy ically icy\nyour had icy gave icy icy icy\nto told ice off my said icy icy icy cold icy\nsa\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nwho ivity icy\nay mind\nice\nity were\ncan I icy icy\nso pack icy had icy icy\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nif icy road icy icy icy\nroad would icy icy icy icy\nicy icy icy icy icy icy icy\nlies icy icy icy icy icy icy\nno icy why icy icy icy\nmy handed ively did\nand icy gave icy given icy\nsome ici ice icy icy icy icy\nmy called cried your icy icy will icy\ntime icy icy icy icy\nreason why icy took icy pen icy\nmy given icy icy icy icy\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nmy eared did icy brought icy\ninside icy icy had\nthe I iction did icy icy icy icy icy\nwell little one\nmy explained\n\nyou took icy had away icy ound\nmy had to\n\nas this my called little icy\nany road icy he icy icy icy\n",
