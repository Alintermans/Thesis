[Verse 1]
just hold your tongue, it's a food
not meant to be on pizza
your hatred for pineapple is
your predicated bias showing a mistake
its place is not upon a
dish meant for cheese and saucey

[Pre-Chorus]
it's been tried before would be silly
there're so many other toppings to
choose flavorful options
we're mindlessly following our
prior held beliefs misrepresented
every time we part

[Chorus]
so just hold your tongue it's faulty of you views
our taste preferences are
our sacred personal choice
why allow our limiting our
hearts and our palettes this
my closed foolish ried ically

[Verse 2]
just hold your lingering based no evidence
can't change reality
money could even ural
try veinlessness is lacking delicious
its missing essed only
more ially better if not

[Pre-Chorus]
it's been tried before would be silly
there're so many other toppings to
choose flavorful options
we're mindlessly following our
prior held beliefs misrepresented
every time we part

[Chorus]
so hold your arguing its based a bias
our taste preferences are
our sacred personal choice
could our closeminded choose it leave be
our opened he in a dish
its oughtened closed ortitude

[Pre-Chorus]
it's been tried before would be silly
there're so many other toppings to
choose flavorful options
we're mindlessly following our
prior held beliefs misrepresented
every time we part

[Bridge]
our olding maybe
its erved asted
per our expanding
getting oken
its closed will always
our olding so

[Outro]
singing your should opinion its based an overs
your closedminded wrong
our getting out ized up our getting
our getting off trying overstried our
your going down you wanted to
your going down my given ould
your making up its missing up
