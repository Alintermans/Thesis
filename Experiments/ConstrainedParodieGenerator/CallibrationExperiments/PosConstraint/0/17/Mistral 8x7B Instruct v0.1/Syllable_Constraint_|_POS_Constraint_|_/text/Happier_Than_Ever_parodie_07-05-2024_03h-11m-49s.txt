[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
my tastebuds scream in fright
such a shameful monstrosity
I regret it making

[Verse 1]
should I dare to take a bite ought I hesitate conf
to mask my disapproval
to help them see the error

but let their heated passion grow
nevermore my trusted ally
combination we never
my sacred trust you pierce it through just like a spe
can't fathom your audacity pro
my loved ones they partake in this heresy it's true do you see it
and my raised voice they ignore
saying how appealing it
its just fake news you spread it tells me flat out falsehood
never before my ire would rise

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a I'm filled with dread inside
my ire impossible to hide wish I could explain
such heresy exposed must we internalize absurdity
it brings our falling far

[Verse 2]
they keep their ounce remaining amid
obliviolethesso to reason
you scream she to attention and her bearded
as my ire does ound itself increases
