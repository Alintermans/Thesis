[Verse 1]
just a regular meal lying on an empty
disrespecting pineapple on a slice so
just a pie advocate created in the deep
dish denying pineapple on a pizza

[Verse 2]
an anchor on a televised
show intent on criticizing
for no good reason do people
my heated arguments go on and

[Pre-Chorus]
discord waiting
chef and diner both despair
it messes up the flavor pair
tomatoes year
delightfulness to freely share
baking in the oven air

[Verse 3]
spent my life defending ought
food should be condiment bound
none to order off known bounds damn lies
nevertheless

[Verse 4]
these fake ingredient
another heated heated
debate never ceases to
my angled arguments go on and

[Pre-Chorus]
discord waiting
chef and diner both despair
it messes up the flavor pair
tomatoes year
delightfulness to freely share
baking in the oven air

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
stopped believing only
can of pineapple this
belie dispute
stopled believing can
take on
stop eating waste
letting pineapple be
is overdue to this
reflex resolve
