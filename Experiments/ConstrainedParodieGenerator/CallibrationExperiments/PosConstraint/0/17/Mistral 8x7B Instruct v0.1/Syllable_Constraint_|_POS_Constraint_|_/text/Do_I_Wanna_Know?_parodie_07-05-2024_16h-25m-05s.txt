[Verse 1]
have you taken a bite of that
gooping pineapple on your pizza plate so sadthat it
both burns your tongue and turns your stomach back
step away from that monstrosist
are you the kind for whom breaking rules is
your credited claim to fame or are you one of us
why would you mar such a tasty
dish by adding fruit
these are questions stuck inside my head each day and night I bro
of what possessed you to commit this foodie crime

[Pre-Chorus]
do I lack the might to fight fate's will these days
helplessness outweighing amped up saving graces
for our taste buds sakes gotta make some changes
for love'nsakes gotta make some amends today

[Chorus]

time capsule to before you boarded up
and down offside your closedminded notions
departures' allurement to tradition at its

or what did so called in what may that poor excuse me
but we refuse concede even for their given

[Pre-Chorus]
