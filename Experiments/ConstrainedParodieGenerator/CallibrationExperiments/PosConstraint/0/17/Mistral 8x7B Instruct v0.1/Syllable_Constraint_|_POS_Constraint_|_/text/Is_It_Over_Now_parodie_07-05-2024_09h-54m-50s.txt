[Intro]
should pineapple stay on a pizza pie

[Verse 1]
when you open the box with
cheese and tomato sauce inside
you took a bite thinking o
what else could be so

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three heated debates letters ever
they claim it something but you know that it matters never sau
they state it's ruining the taste but it's making pizza more
your mind is made up but taste buds yearn for something more baby oh

[Chorus]
was your topping just cheese or maybe pepper
are you offended by pineapple being
caution to the wind by adding
that you'd never thought would be trending
was your topping just cheese or maybe pepper

[Post-Chorus]
should pineapple stay on

[Verse 2]
experiences it owns
extra tartness unknown
crust becomes doughy no one
you'll never enjoy it

[Bridge]
but is your complaining fair do you
a can of pineap
before badmouthing its adding
to create it something like
not something that you'd usually
but I'd venture to
oh imagine my getting from
that with only minor fright
just to start your ordering
but dismissing the idea rightaway

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three heated debates lettin someone else
that you see decide different folks their own go if your desired just
you persist that it's inedible but is it any wonder
your loved ones all fightin for somethin that satisfies their own

[Chorus]
be your topping just cheese or maybe pepper
will your outlook ever be accepting him
try just a bite with an open
that I'd never thought would be trending
is your topping just cheese or maybe pepper

[Post-Chorus]
remains
should our eating what
accept
being your be

[Bridge]
are they complain never
the can contents to
before badmouthing its adding
to taste you anything like
not anything at you order and
or I'd venture to
oh imagine yourself getting
that with only major flight
nevertheless out arguing them
but sticking no to decisions our makes

[Outro]
toppic to everyone
doesn't matter choice to one's that eating here stays
fineprint own making you
but say the two people food
it remains try having
or no
does your agreeing its be their leaving our
