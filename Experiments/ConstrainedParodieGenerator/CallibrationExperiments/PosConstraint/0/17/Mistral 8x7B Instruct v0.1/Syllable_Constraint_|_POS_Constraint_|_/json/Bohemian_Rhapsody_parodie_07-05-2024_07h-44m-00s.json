Is this just fantasy?\nCaught in a landslide, no escape from reality\nOpen your eyes, look up to the skies and see\nI'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy\nBecause I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low\nAny way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me\n\n[Verse 1]\nMama, just killed a man\nPut a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead\nMama, life had just begun\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away\nMama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow\nCarry on, carry on as if nothing really matters\n\n[Verse 2]\nToo late, my time has come\nSends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time\nGoodbye, everybody, I've got to go\nGotta leave you all behind and face the truth\nMama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)\nI don't wanna die\nI sometimes wish I'd never been born at all\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI see a little silhouetto of a man\nScaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?\nThunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me\n(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico\nBut I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me\nHe's just a poor boy from a poor family\nSpare him his life from this monstrosity\nEasy come, easy go, will you let me go?\nBismillah! No, we will not let you go\n(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let me go) Will not let you go\n(Let me go) Will not let you go\n(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\n(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die?\nOh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!\nJust gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here\n[Outro]\n(Ooh)\n(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)\nNothing really matters, anyone can see\nNothing really matters\nNothing really matters to me\nAny way the wind blows [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro]\nshould I eat this pineappleslice upon a\nzone amidst a feastitsoriginunimagin\natedamedopenclosedmindeded\nour believes inside our heads concealed\nby its taste I'm easy seduced delighted low however\nthe tastefoolswe all letupgooverrulesdisguiltwithholdsno\n\n[Verse 1]\nfineineverlika\ningeditched an embargo at what foods willjoinit\noithavetravafacic\nor once my loved began and was their all\nfood fictionsshould prevent so let to call\nat it will now just soon there afterwards taste\nforyuouyourselvesaswithouta for fruit like without for\n\n[Verse 2]\nlatewhatwhatvenven\nomingking soursnowmy to me good foreverness\npepedesuhts departshuttoon it has\nnoshovelltopsheenitobackwithdrawal\nneedeatenhimevilessanall\nme mustto now take to\nme away beleaveandandleaveaforall\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nit createsanvisfilinginilari\nnessmentforpinafigmenlinessacolynew\norldorintoinwonttooafurthermoreyouthisplaceordes\nservecouldwhentheir uponwhichiswith pupsiniteiwhatlovenightcoer b fruitsuselessagainstpro\nand ourher sweet justly all icialistic\nits should never all topicalicious taste\nunneedbewhythisfondfoodlikejust\ninaliveinaliciousous should ural\nnatureevitablitiespinysland\ncaningrededyingingrediedgoinggoinglingling\nlingingalinglingingredgoingedgoingingred\ncaningreddedinginglinging\ningingredededingreded\nwhyeverevernevernever nevermoreore\nanother any any\nconglomerate pizzamongery industry conspiracy\nthighnottinoneughhouldshouldnowhoeverany ivingredged\n\n[Verse 4]\nso your are me go going you and doing from\njustonly my must my get gone me or going\ngetting ohohh havehave so getting the\nnowwhereherewherewhatwhat iredited\n\n[Outro]\noh\nnothingrememb\neredededdingeringingingthingling\nlingtingthingeringthing\ncanonedgingingingingting\n",
