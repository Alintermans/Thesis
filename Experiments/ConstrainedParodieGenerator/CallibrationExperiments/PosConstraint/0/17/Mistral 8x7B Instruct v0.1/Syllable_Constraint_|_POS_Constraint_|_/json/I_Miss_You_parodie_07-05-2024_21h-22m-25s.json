And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nit slices me your taste\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nahola\nthe sweet deception after\na juicy forbidden fruit at dinner\nthe unexpected regret\nof flavors on a pizza\nour wedded cannibalism if we\njust ignore the warning signs\nor what can kill tonight with laughter\nbut as we bite our ending might be\nour dying laughing\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nyour wasted our your\nmy ruined my our\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere do you and your gone away\nmy missing too tossed our can never\nmy will years or ever even\nthis sick syndrome fear\nyield comes in as expected all stalk nightmare\nor as you stare them waiting\nthe fans around the angu\nare bittersweetings ouch leaving us\nfrom endlessnesses's cutting us\nand ask yourself decision\nare your getting cooking ouch are any\nare any evening\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nmake never love you life for us my wasted\nthe pineapple inside\nour arguing your\n\nplease note that this parody is written in\na semirapidy\nits intended it self\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nmake never love you life at our our\nthis horror inside your\nmy gone ourself self\n\nmake just let us arguments of our your\nno get behind it life\nour ending yourself\n\nplease note that this parody is written in\nan expresslike on it\nits supposeded its\n\nbe here hoped we hopes as our its going\nall life over our\nits ended our your\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nour wasted your your\nmy missed our itself\nmy rejected our\n",
