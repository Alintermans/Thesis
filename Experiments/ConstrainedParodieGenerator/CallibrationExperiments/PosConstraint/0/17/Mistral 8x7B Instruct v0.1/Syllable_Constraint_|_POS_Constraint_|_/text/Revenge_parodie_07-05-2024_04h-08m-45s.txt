[Intro]
I hope i, I hope I clearly see
the absurdity of pineap
atop that square of cheese and doughy
what twistedminded soul could
it offer

[Verse]
it sweetens takes away from taste
debauery so reckoned in its place ican't abide
such travesties I've tasted before
within my icy heart it shall forever
more abhor the very thought of
or its icky icky icky icky icky icky
very icking core would ounce forever
and my icy icy hatred icy icy icy will
my heated heated heated heart
preventin further icted ound my will able grasp to
stop it I ould icket ery time
that I near hold that I order the beasted
an ought a be an be I ills
and our rowned rowned will in our is done we
down allow fruitless be gain again go
or my icy icy hatred icy icy icy will

[Chorus]
on us icy he
at he gravity
on it ings
as I heart our
of I ices me cold is
out I ices me

[Outro]
on I gravity
its alled hated it
will us icy ices
allowed icy icy our
eason
