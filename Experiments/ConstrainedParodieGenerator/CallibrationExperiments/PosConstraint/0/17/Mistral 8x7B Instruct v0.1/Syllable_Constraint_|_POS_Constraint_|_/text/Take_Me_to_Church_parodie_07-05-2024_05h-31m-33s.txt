[Verse 1]
my outrage's expressed
in the fruit on a pizza proclaimed
tots adament it's not to be named
its heated presence is truly
outside of decency's blessed norm
it'd better not grace
any stuffed crust abomination
no tropical pizza
he shouldn't have added pineapple
we gasp in disbelief seeing
his sweetened heresy screaming on
each gross flavorful bite taken should
make just one ingredient
our beloved missing precious
becoming our to

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza's sacred space below the cheese that
I offer please it'll warp and its taste increased
should I in joy allow uns
culinary gods demand reject
keep pineapple
your wedged medalled perversion a cruel in
your wed wed it us nothing but her raised go it
be my in despair delight
oh bad holy remove my offered

[Verse 2]
