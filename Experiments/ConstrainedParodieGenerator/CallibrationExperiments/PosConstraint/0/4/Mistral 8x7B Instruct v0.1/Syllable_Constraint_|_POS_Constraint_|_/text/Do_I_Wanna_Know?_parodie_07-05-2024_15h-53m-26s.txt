[Verse 1]
have you tasted pineapple on
a slice of pizza pie and sighed with regret soon after
all that sweet and savory paired in one
does it taste like something's wrong here
do you ever wish you could reverse that
bite and spit it out instead of chewing aftermath
why did someone even think to
put pineapple on
a dish that's meant for tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese
it just doesn't seem to please on repeat playing

[Pre-Chorus]
do I dare to try it again today's the day
thought I'd give it chance but changed my mind right away yeah
baby you and I both know that pizza's meant to
be savory not sweet like a tropical getaw

[Chorus]
trying to forget
how it tasted with regret
I wish I could
forget the taste
of pineapple
on my pizza plate
now I've thought it through enough
trying to forget
oh how I regret

[Verse 2]
so are you brave enough
to take a bite again and prove me wrong
or will you stick to your original thought
simmer down and take a bite without a fuss much ado
but I don't know if you feel the same as I do buddy
but we could enjoy our pizza without the pine
and it would be so much better believe you me

[Pre-Chorus]
do I dare to try it again today's the day
thought I'd give it chance but changed my mind right away yeah
baby you and I both know that pizza's meant to
be savory not sweet like a tropical getaw

[Chorus]
do I dare to try it again today
maybe give it chance and not
run away yeah baby we
both know that pizza's meant to be sav
ory not sweet like a tropical treat
so let's enjoy our pizza
without the canned pineapple
upon our fe
et to partake oh

[Outro]
do I dare to try it again darling is it
worth the taste or should I just forget yeah baby we
both know that pizza's meant to be enjoyed without
the taste of pineapple on my pizza anymore
do I dare to try it again baby do you want
me eating pineapple on my pizza plate no more
do I dare to try it again do you want me never
