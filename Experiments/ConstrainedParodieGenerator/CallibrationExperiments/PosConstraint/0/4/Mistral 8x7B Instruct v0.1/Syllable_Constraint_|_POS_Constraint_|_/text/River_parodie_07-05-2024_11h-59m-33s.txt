[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a denier rejected
pineapple on a pizza
said it's tasty but it's heretical felt the anger from
foodies washing over me oh little one I don't
want to admit to something if
all it's gonna cause is pain the truth and my lies
now are falling like the

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home from the store with pineapple
slices neatly placed on pizza
on his plate to catch his family
scoffing in disbelief sweat jackets tossed aside
in disgust he's a disgrace to pizza lovers
his wife just wants to hurl it in the trash
but he insists it's a delicacy tried to convince
her it's a culinary masterpiece she can't resist it she
understands it's folly to
mess with a man's pizza even slim shady knows that but
she's concocted a devious plan to remove
the offending fruit from the pizza knife in hand she says
their pizza's hanging by a thread
been on the web lately searching for solutions to
rid her pizza of the pineapple she says maybe she'll try it
raw and uncooked just to spite her husband
and I know she's using me to further

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I don't want to admit to
pineapple on a pizza
said it's tasty but it's heretical felt the anger from
foodies washing over me oh little one I don't
want to admit to something if
all it's gonna cause is pain the truth and my lies
now are falling like the

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a last ditched effort to salvage dinner
turned into a full blown disaster it was pine
apple on half of the pizza now she feels
disgusted and betrayed he left the table
upset so what he did it first to her too now how
am I supposed to tell this guy that we can't have
pineapple on our pizza anymore it's hard to
get the words out I'm aloof nervous and scared to say it to his face so
I revert to texting him apologizing for my behavior
making excuses explaining that it
was a regrettable decision and that we should
stick to traditional toppings from now on he responds with
disbelief saying he can't believe he
entertained the idea in the first
place and that he's disappointed in
me for suggesting such a travesty he says
don't take it personally I just
don't want pineapple
on our pizza anymore I hope you
understand and can respect my decision after all it
was

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I don't want to admit to
pineapple on a pizza
said it's tasty but it's heretical felt the anger from
foodies washing over me oh little one I don't
want to admit to something if
all it's gonna cause is pain the truth and my lies
now are falling like the

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
you can call me crazy
you can
call
me insane
but I won't let pine
apple defile my pizza again

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the skeptic never a belie
ver in pineapple on pizza always
questioned its validity as a topping leaving me
swerving in disbelief unable to understand
how anyone could enjoy such a mon
strosity calling it a
delicacy what else can I say it
was foolish of me to even entertain the
idea of putting pineapple on a
pizza what was I thinking it was
wrong on so many levels I should have known
better than to compromise the sanctity

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I don't want to admit to
pineapple on a pizza
said it's tasty but it's heretical felt the anger from
foodies washing
over me
I apologize for suggesting such
heresy
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the addition of pineapple to pizza now
is falling like acid
