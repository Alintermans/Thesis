[Verse 1]
shun pineapple with all your
might before taking a bite and
she'll scorn your choice of topping beware of
disgust that she'll surely bring forth

[Pre-Chorus]
denounce pizza with pineapple
it's just wrong in every way
denounce pizza with pineapple
stay loyal to pizza

[Chorus]
with pineapple hidden in its place
there's no excuse for such a dis
grace here we stand against such a
mistake here we stand against such
an abomination a mon
strosity let's stick to pepper

[Post-Chorus]
yeah stop it

[Verse 2]
your tastebuds will betray
you into liking ham and
pineapple but don't give in to
the sweet and savory sinful

[Pre-Chorus]
denounce pizza with pineapple
it's just wrong in every way
denounce pizza with pineapple
stay loyal to pizza

[Chorus]
with pineapple hidden in its place
there's no excuse for such a dis
grace here we stand against such a
mistake here we stand against such
an abomination a mon
strosity let's stick to pepper

[Post-Chorus]
yeah stop it

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]

the lack of pineapple because

[Pre-Chorus]
