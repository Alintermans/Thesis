[Intro]
is this the real slice taking liberties here
pineapple's a disgrace that should not appear career
look at this monstrosity causing such fear
I'm just a poor bloke who holds pizza dearer
easy to add but ruins the flow does it though anyway
the wind blows decides if I'll eat this dish today to me it does

[Verse 1]
put pineapple aside
can't believe people think it's a good guide alone it
belongs on a ham or in
a sweet and sour dish but never on
cheese and tomato a sin to combine
mama mia it's a travesty that pine
ruins the symphony of flavors divine carry on

[Verse 2]
late to realize mistake
should've barred it from day one can't believe I part
ook piecemeal my heart is full of regret
won't let it happen again no way no
way the wind blows I won't allow
its presence anymore
wish I'd never allowed it near my plate at

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
little bits of fruit don't belong on a
piece savory and hot don't you see scaramou
chef won't approve so don't you dare suggest it yo
uza bismillah isn't going to save it no way bismillah I say nay bismillah ain't gonna
save it from being thrown away bismillah
won't ever let it near my plate again
galileo what were you thinking of
such a strange combination makes my stomach
growl in disdain won't tolerate it
get it away from me don't apologize
beelzebub himself wouldn't approve of this ab
omination on a pizza
making my taste buds offended
not even ounce of sweetness can compensate for
this afront to the pizza
community mamma mia get it away from me mamma
mia do not serve it to me it's an abomination you

[Verse 4]
just can't do this to me no way oh baby
just gotta get out gotta get away from this
blasphemy mamma mia take it away
back to the kitchen to start anew oh baby can

[Outro]
oh
nothing really
matters to me anymore no way no way
nothing really matters
nothing really matters to me
any way the pizza
