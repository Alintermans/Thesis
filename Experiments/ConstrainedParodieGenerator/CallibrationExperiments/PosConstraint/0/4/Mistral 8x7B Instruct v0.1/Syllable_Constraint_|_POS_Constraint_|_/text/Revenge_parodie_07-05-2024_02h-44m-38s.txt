[Intro]
I believe I I believe I just
found a way to take a standag
ainst the culinary crime so vast
it's an outrage that I can
t resist

[Verse]
I sliced up pineapple chunks for
a pizza topped with ham and mozzarella galore ore
oh man I can't ignore taste bud
treason no more will I partake of this ab
omination called pineapple
on pizza it's a sin and a shameful act ingrained in
far too many minds don't give in to
the trend let your taste buds be free from this atrocity we
all must protest pineapple doesn
t belong on a pizza crust best left on the fruit stand
oh man I can't ignore taste bud
offenses no more will I partake of this
abomination called pineap
ple on pizza it's a sin and a shameful act ingrained
in far too many minds don't give in
to the trend let your taste buds be free from this atrocity

[Chorus]
atrocity we
all must protest pine
apple on pizza it won
t slide into your
taste buds let it go let it
go pineapple on

[Outro]
on pizza it won
't slide into your taste bud
s let it go let it
go pineapple on pizza it
won slice
