[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I spite you, I spite you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
greetings there
the monster from my nightmare
the stain upon my plate so bare the unw
anted guest on my pizza
that gives me shivers down the
spine when I take a bite and find It there I
can't abide it making
me lose my appetite each time and
ruining every single slice it
touches with its slimy

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I spite you I spite you
I spite you I spite you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is it and I'm so sorry
for the abomination on my dish
I crave something savory and
the taste is nothing
similar to what I hoped it would be so
disappointed as I stare
at the chunks of pineapple
among the cheese and pepperoni
wondering why it was added
when it should have never been
ordered In the first place tonight am I
going to regret

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
please don't serve it to me you're already
the disgusting after
taste in my mouth I spite
you I spite you I spite you I spite you so
please skip the pineapple
I spite you I spite you

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
please don't serve it to me you're already
the disgusting after
taste in my mouth I spite
you I spite you I spite you I spite you so
please skip the pineapple
I spite you I spite you
please don't serve it to me you're already
the disgusting after
taste in my mouth I spite
you I spite you I spite you I spite you so
please skip the pineapple
I spite you I spite you

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I spite you I spite you
I spite you I spite you
I spite you I spite you
I spite your pineapple
