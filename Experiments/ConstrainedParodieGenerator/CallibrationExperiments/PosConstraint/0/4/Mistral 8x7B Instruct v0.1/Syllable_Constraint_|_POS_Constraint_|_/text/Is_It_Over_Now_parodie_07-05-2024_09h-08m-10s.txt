[Intro]
should pineapple be on a pizza pie

[Verse 1]
when you order late at night
without a second thought in sight
they slap it on tight and bright
you still take a bite

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred delivered pies later
you see it on the menu staring back at you like a trait
you hesitate but you can't resist the temptation of
the sweet and savory bait gotta shake it up someday maybe

[Chorus]
was it vile when your tastebuds cried in shock
is it still just as bad when you give it a
second try and wonder why you
ever thought pineapple on pizza
was a good idea in the first place now

[Post-Chorus]
should it be on aizza

[Verse 2]
tomato sauce and melted
cheese masks the deception
pepperoni remains the
meal's only protection

[Bridge]
and did your heartbreak when you saw it
an insult to the
traditional pizza pie no
one asked for pineapple on
it but here we are and now you can
never unsee it or
undo the abomination
in front of you gotta own
up to your mistake take a
bite and swallow your pride it's just a pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred exhausting first dates later
if they say they like pineapple on pizza you'll probably hate her fate
you hesitate but you can't resist the temptation of shared
values gotta shake it up someday maybe let them have their way

[Chorus]
was it vile when your tastebuds cried in shock
is it still just as bad when you give it a
second try and wonder why you
ever thought pineapple on pizza
was a good idea in the first place now

[Post-Chorus]
aha
should it be our is
surely
we can agree

[Bridge]
did your heartbreak when you
saw it an insult
to the traditional pizza
pie no one asked for pineap
ple on pizza but here we are and
now you can never
undo the abomination
in front of you gotta own
up to your mistake take a bite and
swallow your pride it's just a pizza gotta

[Outro]
fast forward to three hun
dred takeout pizzas later say the one thing I've been wanting
but no should pineapple be on pizza

pizza no no no no
no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no
