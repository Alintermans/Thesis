[Verse 1]
two slices tried and my ver
dict is clear trying to shirk dietary
norms and deviation
I realized quickly when my tastebud
offense rose up that pineapple on pizza's offense
is a culinary

[Pre-Chorus]
and I sigh sometimes when I'm sitting down to eat
when I see that sweet and savory treat
and I my taste buds doth protest unusual
and so I put my fork down and I take a breath then
I spit it all right out and I give a good
yell from the pit of my stomach what
is going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey honey
I said hey what is going on
and I say hey hey hey
hey baby
I said hey what is happening

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh uh u
oh oh
oh
ohuh u

[Verse 2]
and I tried
oh my god did I tried
I tasted all the
permutations in this
industry
and I prayed earnestly
oh my god did I prayed eager
for relief frailty

[Pre-Chorus]
and I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed dream
justly upholding the culinary
and I my taste buds doth defend courageously
and so I put my fork down and I take a breath then
I spit it all right out and I give a good
yell from the pit of my stomach what
is going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey daughter
I said hey what is going
on and I say hey hey
hey mother
I said hey what is happening
and I say hey hey hey
wake in the morning and taste without
devotion
take a deep breath and you shall find new
sensation
and I scream from the top of might
lungs what is going on
and I say hey hey hey in the name
of decency what
is going onnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
and I say
hey hey hey with all due respect

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
ohuh u

[Outro]
two bites tried and my verdict
keeps repeating trying to get away from
that great big mistake hoping
