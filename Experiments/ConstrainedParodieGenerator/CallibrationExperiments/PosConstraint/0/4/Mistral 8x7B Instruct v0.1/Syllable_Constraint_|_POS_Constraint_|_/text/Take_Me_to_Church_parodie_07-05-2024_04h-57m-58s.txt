[Verse 1]
my palate's gotta
hate for pineapple on a pizza
think it's a travesty and tacky
should've banished it soonersaid
if pizza purists had their way
my slice would never sway
towards that sweet and juicy betray
on a cheesy round tray
we relish sauce and melted cheese we
don't pine for pineapple sup
my tastebuds yearn for savory
pineapple's got no place on top of
my beloved pepperoni
command me to keep it clean and
pineapple free is how

[Pre-Chorus]
a mercy
mercifully

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at any costafection
tell me sacrilege you won't abideby
let me savor savory
pineapple has no place in my life
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at any costafection
tell me sacrilege you won't abideby
let me savor savory
pineapple has no place in my life

[Verse 2]
if my tastebuds crave tradition
they yearn for no devi
tropical fruit's got no business
on my pizza pie parad
drain the olive oil can full up tom
cover up with pepperoni
the sight of pineapple makes
my stomach churn in rageous
my hatred for tasteless atroc
this calls for drastic measures in
a crowded social

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at any costafection
tell me sacrilege you won't abideby
let me savor sav
pineapple has no place in my life
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at any costafection
tell me sacrilege you won't abideby
let me savor savory
pineapple has no place in my life

[Bridge]
no room for imposters when the feast beginsat
the table of connoisseurs nothing's weakerthan false ad
in the joys of gastronomy that sacred scene
only then my tastebuds sing only then my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
abominabl

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at any costafection
tell me sacrilege you won't abideby
let me savor savory
pineapple has no place in my life
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie at any costafection
tell me sacrilege you won't abideby
let me savor savory
pineapple has no place in my life
