[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
craving pineapple gone too far take it off the
began with a slice how did it end up like this it was
only a topping but now it's a loss for all
now my stomach's in knots and I regret it so
as I remember fondly the days before the
toppings disaster struck making me feel quite low
and it's all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
but they've added pineapple
I used to love ham and
take it off
and it's driving me crazy the taste isn
't the same anymore

[Chorus]
frustration deepens as pizza under
rule toppings incompetent
wishin' for a simple pie
but it wasn't meant tonight
pleadin' for a savory
replace the pineapple and
I'm mr angry

[Guitar Solo]

as I long for the days without pineapple and
just my favorite toppings galore to restore
and it's no longer in

[Pre-Chorus]
but their adding pineapple
I used to it order

and it's driving me crazy the taste
