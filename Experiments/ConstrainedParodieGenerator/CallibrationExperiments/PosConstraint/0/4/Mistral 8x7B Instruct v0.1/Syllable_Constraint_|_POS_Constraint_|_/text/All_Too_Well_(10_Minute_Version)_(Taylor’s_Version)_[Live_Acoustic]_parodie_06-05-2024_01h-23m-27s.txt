[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that piewith pineapple
my taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow
the tangy sweetness clashed with savory to
ppings and I spit it out in disgust right now

[Verse 2]
oh your twisted blend of flavorsleft me mortified
the slimy texture mixed with cheese was a mess
acid reflux rising up inside everyone
who's tasted this monstrosity can attest

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know its a classic
but pineapple has no place
on a pizza pie it just does not belong at
all oh oh

[Chorus]
because that's not how it's meant to bea pizza
topped with fruit it's just not meant to beeat at alli remember
cheese and tomato sauce they
reign supreme I remember it

[Verse 3]
pepper flakes and parmesansprinkled generously on
top adding spice and flavor to the mix and yetyou add pineapple
and it's a sin I can't believe you'd do something like this
to pizza it's just not fair I can't forgive you
or your twisted tastebuds I'm scarred for life seeing pineap
plesauce mixture on a slice of pizza again
and again I can't unsee it I just can't just
