[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that ignites
debates through endless nights and fights but
you don't really care for pineapple pizza
it's that sweet and savory mix
that certain folks can't resist
but to me it just doesn't harmonize like

[Chorus]
pineapple ain't fine on a
pineapple don't belong on

[Verse 2]
you insists it's a culinary
masterpiece fit for royalty
but to me it's just a messy disaster
the sweet fruit and tomato sauce
your tastebuds may rejoice but it
leaves my palate screaming for a disaster

[Chorus]
pineapple ain't fine on a
pineapple don't belong on

[Verse 3]
you say I don't understand
it's just a topping trend absurd
but if I did still not a can of worms would
I open to partake in something so
ridiculous as pineapple
on a pizza that's meant to be pure and un

[Chorus]
pineapple ain't fine on a
pineapple don't belong on

[Verse 4]
I did my best to be polite
I masked my disgust with all my might
but seeing pineapple on pizza's just not
my cup of tea no matter how
much they claim it's tasty to me
it's just an unholy abomination

[Chorus]
pineapple stay off my pizza
won't tolerate it on a
pizza deserves better than pine
don't you dare disrespect it
please help me uphold the honor
of pizzas everywhere with a
wholesale rejection of pineap
lets champion gastronomy
lets consign pineapple pizza

[Outro]
to the annals of history

[Additional Lyrics]
remember when you tried to
convince me to give it a go
but now you know just where I stand you know it
won't sway me to partake in this cal
zonesque amalgamation so
heed my plea and keep your pineapple off my plate

[Additional Lyrics]
these heated debates persist and
our loved ones get divided
but when it comes to pineapple on pizza
it's not a matter of opinion
it's a question of good taste and
that's something we can all unite against today

[Additional Lyrics]
there may be those who embrace
this monstrosity with open
arse but I won't be one of them I say
no to pineapple on pizza today
and forevermore until the end
of days because it's just plain wrong ok yeah yeah
