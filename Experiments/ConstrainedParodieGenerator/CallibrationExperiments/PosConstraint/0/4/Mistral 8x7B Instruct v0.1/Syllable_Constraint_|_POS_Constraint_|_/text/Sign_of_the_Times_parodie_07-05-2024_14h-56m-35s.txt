[Verse 1]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
replace it with some mushrooms
or extra cheese instead of that
can't believe you'd ruin pizza like that sight
tastes like disappointment in
a greasy cardboard trap now

[Pre-Chorus]
we've seen this all before why do it
pineapple has no place being on a
pizza pie gotta go
we've seen this all before why ruin
pizza with pineapple again gotta
let it go already

[Chorus]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
take it far away from pizza
take it far away from pizza
just drop that pineapple off your plate now
it does not belong on pizza
take it far away from pizza

[Verse 2]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
have a slice of perfection
topped with tomato sauce and
memories of margherita shining
heaven awaits without pine
away from pizza it can

[Pre-Chorus]
we've seen this all before why do it
pineapple has no place being on a
pizza pie gotta go
we've seen this all before why ruin
pizza with pineapple again gotta
let it go already

[Chorus]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
take it far away from pizza
take it far away from pizza
leave that pineapple off your plate nowadays
pizza is better without it
take it far away from pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
we've seen this all before why do it
pineapple has no place being on a
pizza pie gotta go
we've seen this all before why ruin
pizza with pineapple again gotta
let it go already

[Bridge]
it's time we admit it
pineapple has no
place on pizza let it
be our little
secret that we tried
it regret now it

[Outro]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight for
our beloved pizza
for our beloved pizza we gotta get it
away from pineapple we gotta get away
we gotta get away from pine
apple we gotta get away
we wanna get away from pine
