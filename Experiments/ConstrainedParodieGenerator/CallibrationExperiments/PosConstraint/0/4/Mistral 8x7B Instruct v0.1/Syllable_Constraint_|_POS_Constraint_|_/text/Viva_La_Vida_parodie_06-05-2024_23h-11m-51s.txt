[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice crushed
now I wake up to a different
tragedy unfolding in

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I fondly recall the
sweet and savory blend I'd savor
listened to the crowd exclaim
then I tasted ham and pineapple shame
one bite left me wanting to
scream and throw it on the floor
discovered my pizza dreams were built on
a disgusting combo never to be ad

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
hear my stomach churn a groanin' órganos
bursting laughter from my foes singin
be my tastebuds you defense
I'll never put pineapple on pizza
in vain explanation I cannot
fathom why this exists a
dishonestly combined
topping there was never meant to

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it became a horrible and
sour wind that blew away the
toppings choice I'd once adored people
horrified by what I'd now endorse ried
itiation comes demanding
outrage over pineapple on
pizzas no one in their right mind would order
mmm what a monstrosity is this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
hear my stomach churn a groanin' órganos
bursting bitter laughter from my ire
be my tastebuds you defense
I'll never put pineapple on pizza
in vain explanation I cannot
fathom why this exists a dishonest
combination never
meant to soil the sacredness of

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohh what a tragedy
putting pineapple on
toppin's is such a trav
esty ohh what absurd

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohh what a tragedy
putting pineapple on pizza is
stoppit it's destroying
culinary excellence ohh what
curiosity it
doesn't belong on pizza or
planet earth let alone
it's against the rules of culinary
masters I plead forget
that there was ever pineapple on
people's beloved pizza
what a catastrophe ohh had never
never a mistake quite
like pineapple on pizza been

[Outro]
uumph someone help
end this nightmare
