[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple does not belong on a dish
it spoils the taste and texture of
my pizza that I love so much
my pizza that I love so much

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you put it on my slice next timeround
its sweetness overpow
ers the savory delight that ast
ounds and astounds us all roundround

[Pre-Chorus]
I was hoping for a better
topping it's not getting any bet
ter with pineapple in the mix
taking away from the joy of the feastlike a le
sson unlearned it just doesn't
fit it's time to reconsider
can't believe I ate pineap
ple on my pizza before now

[Chorus]
shame you added it to my beloved
circular b ready
shame you robbed it of its intended
flavor spectacular
shame it doesn't live up to the hype imposed
it's not deserving of this sacred
position my life my love my drive
depend upon the taste

[Verse 3]
third things third
take a moment to consider the
consequences before
deciding to add pineapple to the
meal it's just not meant to be oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't understand the
fascination with pineapple
on pizza it just doesn't make
sense it's not a good fitfor the
taste buds it's time to reconsiderit's not working

position my life my love my drive
depend upon the taste

[Verse 4]
last matters
that's all I have to say on the matter
pineapple does not belong
on pizza that's just the way
it is and always will be

[Pre-Chorus]
and that's the end of the storyno more pineapple
on my pizza ever againit's time to move on to gre
ater things and

[Chorus]
