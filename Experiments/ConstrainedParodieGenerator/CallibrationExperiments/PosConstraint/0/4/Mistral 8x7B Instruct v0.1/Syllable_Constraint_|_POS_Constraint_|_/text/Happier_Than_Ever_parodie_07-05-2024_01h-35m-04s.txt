[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue indeed
wish my taste buds knew it better
I'd savor every

[Verse 1]
take some time to ponder why it's such a blunderer
to cover my slice with pine

the world just how much pineapple does
belong on a pizza which is to say not at all okay

once and for all don't let it ruin another slice
please we all deserve better than that my friend

[Outro]
pineapple ruined pizza
claimed it as its own creation made
me miss the days of simple
cheese and tomato sauce no more sour
mem
ories
left
instead
