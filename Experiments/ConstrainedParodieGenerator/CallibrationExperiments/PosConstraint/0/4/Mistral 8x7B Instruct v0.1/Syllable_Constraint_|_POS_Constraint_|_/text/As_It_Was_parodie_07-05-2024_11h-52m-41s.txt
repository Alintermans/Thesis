[Intro]
come on listeners, we wanna share our view

[Verse 1]
held back by dough
pizza's holdin' me back slow
I implore you to toss out that pineapple
why allow it to go on your
delicious pie
it just shouldn't be allowed to

and ruin the pizza's true harmony

[Chorus]
in this culinary
world it's just not like it used to be
in this culinary
world it's just not like it used to be
like it had been before
it tastes so much better

[Verse 2]

in this culinary
world it's just not like it used to be
in this culinary
world it's just not like it used to be
like it had been before
it tastes so much better

don't settle for second rate so called pizza with
picky eaters who think pineapple is
acceptable just say no to pineapple on your

[Outro]
as
in this cul
inary world it's just not like it
was as it was before
