[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've read recipes online
the savory and the
toppings that align fam
marinara and the
cheese to perfection
but pineapple on it
is a culinary sin that I won't commit

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they asked o√π est la pine
why not give it a chance
I ain't lookin for flavor
that's too daring or advance
just something tasty
no controversial
something simple I can have
time and time again rel
I want something simply this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doodoodoo doodoodo
doodoodoo doodo
doodoodoo doodoodo
oh I want something simply this
doodoodoo doodoodo
doodoodoo doodo
doodoodoo doodoodo
oh I want something simply this
I want something simply this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I read recipe books so
many gourmet choices
but pineapple on a
pizza pie is not one
of my favorites rolls
an absurdity in
orbit it revolves too far to fit for me

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
he asked tu veux la pineapple
why not give it a shot
I replied why do that thing na
that's just way too hot oh no
just something appet
no controversial
something simple I can have
time and time repeated

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something simply this
I want something simply this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something honestly
doodoodoo doodoodo
oh I want something
simply this doodoodoo
oh I want something honestly
doodoodoo doodoodo
oh I want something
dependably this do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for nobody
with some unusual blend
just something appet
no controversial
something simple I can have
time and time repeated
I desire something just

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something simply this
oh I want something honestly
oh I want something honestly
