[Intro]
I think I think I finally found
a way to stop the pineapple
from being put on pizza at all
it's time to take a stand and
make a change

[Verse]
I see the horror on the plate
pineapple on pizza it's a hate crime against our
taste buds I can't believe we let
this happen for so long it's time to fight back
no more tropical flavors on
our pizza it's time to draw the line it's time to take
a stand and make it clear that pineapple
has no place on a pizza it's just not right it's just not fair
it's time to put an end to this
culinary abomination and show the world we
care pizza is a serious thing
you can't just put anything on it and
call it a day no way no way
and if you think that pineapple belongs on a pizza
then you my friend are wrong and need to re
evaluate your life choices pineapple on pizza is

[Chorus]
just not right just not
right just not right just
not right just not right just not
right just not right just
not right just not right just not
right just not right just

[Outro]
if you value your
taste buds and your dignint
take a stand with me and
say no to pineapple pizza
join me
