[Verse 1]
two slices of pizza sit
stacked up high on my plate ican't ignore
that pineapple on top
it's like a personal affront my taste
like a punk trying to infiltrate through a palace
of a culinary

[Pre-Chorus]
and so my stomach churns just thinking about it
how could they do this to a beautiful
piece of dough stretched out so thin and delicate oh
the toppings should enhance not overpower the flav
or my tastebuds which are very select
ive and refined at least when it comes
to matters of

[Chorus]
hey hey hey pineapple
please exit
hey hey hey we don't want you
on our pizza please
hear our
plea pineapple just go away

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I try to
understand different
cultures love for this
abomination they
insist it
tastes divine blasphemy
my tastebuds can't align
with minds that support

[Pre-Chorus]
and so my stomach churns just thinking about it
how could they do this to a beautiful
piece of dough stretched out so thin and delicate oh
the toppings should enhance not overpower the flav
or my tastebuds which are very select
ive and refined at least when it comes
to matters of

[Chorus]
hey hey hey pineapple
please exit
hey hey hey we don't want
you on our pizza
please exit
our plea pineapple just go
away hey oh oh oh
