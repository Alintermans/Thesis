[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fool regarding a
pineapple on a pizza
been a clown with my jokes ain't funny at all my lies are
falling flat like a crust that's burnt to a crisp feeling oh
so small like a pepperoni
I don't want to admit to something if all
it's gonna cause is pain

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's wandering into the pizzeria
scoping out the menu tryna
understand why people do this to
themselves to their tastebuds and their health and their
wallets throwing away dough like its growing on
trees pineapple has no business being
on a pizza it's a travesty abomination
combining flavors that don't belong together like a bad love
perhaps she's attractive but
but its shallow and won't last tryna to justify
the unjustifiable adding insult to
injury that's already been done to the pizza that
that poor pizza trying to be
something it's just not meant to be anything more than
just a cheese or pepperoni don't get it twisted thinking
people want this monstrosity taking up
valuable real estate on the menu

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fool regarding a
pineapple on a pizza
been a clown with my jokes ain't funny at all my lies are
falling flat like a crust that's burnt to a crisp feeling oh
so small like a pepperoni
I don't want to admit to something if all
it's gonna cause is pain

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one pizza stand turned into a two
topping disaster calling out for a rescue
he found out now she needs replacing like a
moldy crust he left so what he started it
now how am I supposed to tell this clientele that
we're through with pineapple pizza for good it's hard to
find the words I'm aloof and nervous and confused don't
want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth don't take it selfish
personal I just can't say this face to face so I resort to
making a parody like a hole in
the wall diner don't have to be reserved in a
booth I just feel like the person who I'm turning into is
irreversible I preached on you like it
was church at the pew and now that I got
your attention I don't want it
take advantage of my thirst to pursue something
selfish and abusing my power to
speak my mind my sermon
and speech detergent and bleach are burning the
wound cause now it's a stain on my reputation we can't
aff

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fool regarding a

the ace up the sleeve fuck can I say deception is an
issue I'd be swerving on the highway of lies like
I'm drifting on ice maybe that's why came
at you sideways with my ap

love for experimenting with toppings left
us in a wreck tangled what else can
