[Intro]
heylisten up y'allgot a message to spread

[Verse 1]
people down south
they got a weird obsession
pineapple on pizza it's a crime against
humanity that ain't no
invitation
to a flavorful fiesta
it's an abomination
can't we just stick to the classics bas

[Chorus]
in this world of food it
ain't the same as it used to be
in this world of food it
ain't the same as it used to be
as it was as it was
you know it used to be

[Verse 2]
pepperoni
sausage mushroom and onion
that's the way we like it in our town
you can keep your ham and your
pineapple too
we don't need that on our
pizza crew don't you know
what's good for the goose is good for the gander

[Chorus]
in this world of food it
ain't the same as it used to be
in this world of food it
ain't the same as it used to be
as it was as it was
you know it used to be

[Bridge]
listen I don't wanna hear about
your hawaiian pizza cravings california style
don't mean nothing to me we got real
italian pizza that's the way it's supposed to be

[Outro]
ye
as it was
you know it ain't the same as it
used to be as it was
