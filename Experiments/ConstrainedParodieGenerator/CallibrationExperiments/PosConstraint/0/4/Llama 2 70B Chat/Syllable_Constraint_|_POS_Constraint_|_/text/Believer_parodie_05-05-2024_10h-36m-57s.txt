[Verse 1]
first things first
I got a message that I need to share
I'm fired up and tired of
pineapple on pizza being
the way that things have become u

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you try to tell me pineapple belongs
you'll be master of your
own pizza fate don't you forget
it's the way that things should be u

[Pre-Chorus]
I saw the atrocity with
my own eyes in a restaurant down
the street people choosing to def
ile their pizzas with this fruit abomination it
made my stomach turn and my heart
singing from anger from the pain
writing my manifesto for
the few that still have taste that's left

[Chorus]
pizza it used to be a you made
me believe in the san
urity of toppings but now it
seems the masses have lost
their culinary compass pain you made me
a pineapple on pizza hater
break me down build me up into a
crusader against this

[Verse 3]
third things third
can't you see the beauty in a
pepperoni and sa
usage combined they're meant to be yours and
mine pizza toppings in perfect

[Pre-Chorus]
harmony sending a prayer
to the culinary gods up
above that pineapple on a
pizza will soon be a distant
memory and our tastebuds will be free at
last from this gastronomic blasphemy enough is enough
its time to take

[Chorus]
pizza it used to be a you made
me believe in the san
urity of toppings but now it
seems the masses have lost
their culinary compass pain you made me
a pineapple on pizza hater
break me down build me up into a
crusader against this

[Verse 4]
a stand last
things last by the grace of pepperoni
and the flames of desire
pineapple will never be
the future of pizza its

[Pre-Chorus]
time we took back our plates and reclaimed our taste
the blood in my veins boils at the thought of this abomina
tion the blood in

[Chorus]
pizza it used to be a you made
me believe in the san
urity of toppings but now it
seems the masses have lost
their culinary compass pain you made me
a pineapple on pizza hater
break me down build me up into a
crusader against this
