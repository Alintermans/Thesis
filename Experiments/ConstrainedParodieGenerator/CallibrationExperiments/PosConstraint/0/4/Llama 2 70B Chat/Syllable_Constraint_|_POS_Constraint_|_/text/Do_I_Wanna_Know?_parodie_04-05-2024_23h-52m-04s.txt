[Verse 1]

pizza that you're eatin' with your crew when I see it on
your plate it makes me wanna scream at you

abomination to the pizza gods up in the
heavens it's just not what they had
in mind when they made
this sacred dish that we all love an' adore do you know what
I'm sayin' take it off don't make me walk way

[Pre-Chorus]
please don't do it do you know what I mean don
pandas don't even eat pineapples in the wild
