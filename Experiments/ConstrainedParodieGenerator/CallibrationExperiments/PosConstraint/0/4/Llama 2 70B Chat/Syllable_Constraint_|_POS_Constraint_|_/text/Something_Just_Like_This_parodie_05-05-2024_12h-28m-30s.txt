[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for
the flavors and the che
the pepperoni and
bacon and sausage too
but then they added
pineapple to the mix
it's just not something I can fix no way pineapple

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said what do you want on your
pizza how much can you
risk I'm not looking for something
that's oh so bizarre something
that fairytales are
made of just something
I can eat and enjoy to
the fullest pineapple
on pizza no way no way

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
this pizza without
pineapple this pizza

in salad not on top
of my pizza no way no no

I've visited hawaii
and tasted the local
cuisine but never did
