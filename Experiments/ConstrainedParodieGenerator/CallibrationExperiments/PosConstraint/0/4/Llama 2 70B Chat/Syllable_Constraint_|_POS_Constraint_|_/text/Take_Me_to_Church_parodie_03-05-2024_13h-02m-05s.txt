[Verse 1]
my slice's got issues
it's the trouble with a fitted sheet
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've folded it sooner
if the kitchen ever did speak
she's the final straw that
breaks the chef's back every sunday
the toppings keep getting
more bleak a fresh disaster each week
they say pineapple has no place
on a pizza my church agrees no
matter the topping you heard them say
let's keep it traditional
what's happened to our taste bud
do we really want to

[Pre-Chorus]
a amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take my pizza
I won't worship at the shrine of pineapple
its flavor doesn't belong here neither does its
smell offer me something del
icious oh culinary god let
me give you up
take my pizza I won't worship at the shop
of pineapple lies its flavor doesn't belong
here neither does its smell oh
culinary god let me give you

[Verse 2]
if my taste buds are of the good times
my lovers the pepper
to keep them on my side they war
a flavorful sacrifice
drain the sauce swap it out with something
worthy something meaty for the
main course that's a hideous
looking pineapple what you
got in the kitchen we have a
lot of picky eaters that looks
disgusting that looks

[Chorus]
take my pizza
I won't worship at the shrine of pineapple
its flavor doesn't belong here neither does its
smell offer me something del
icious oh culinary god let
me give you up
take my pizza I won't worship at the shop
of pineapple lies its flavor doesn't belong
belongs here neither does its
smell oh culinary god let me

[Bridge]
no culinary experts when flavors combine
there's no sweeter taste than what we fashion unique humans
in the madness of that heated kitchen scene when
only then our taste buds are clean when only then

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh enjoy
ain enemy

[Chorus]
take my pizza
I won't worship at the shrine of pineapple
its flavor doesn't belong here neither does its
smell offer me something del
icious oh culinary god let
me give you up
take my pizza I won't worship at the shop
of pineapple lies its flavor doesn't belong
here neither does its smell oh
culinary god let me give you
