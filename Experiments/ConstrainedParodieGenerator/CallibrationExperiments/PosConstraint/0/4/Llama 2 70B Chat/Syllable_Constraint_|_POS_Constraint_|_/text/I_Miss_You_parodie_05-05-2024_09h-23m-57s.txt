[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
pizza is calling me

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the topping of my heartache
the sauce of my desire within the
oven of temptation burn
we can live like pepperon
and cheese in perfect harmony and never
have pineapple on our
pizza evermore and nevermore
and in the bites we'll wish this never ends
we'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple has no place
pineapple will never

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor and I can
taste it in my dreams tonight why must it
be so far away and always
this terrible sight
of pineapple on pizza comes creeping on
like a bad decision in
my stomach turning with the
wrath of indigestion will you please
go away and stop this pain ton
and please don't come again
come again don't come again no more
come again yes come

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
please don't waste your time on pineapple you
already have the voice
of reason in your head
saying pineapple has no place on our
pizza pineapple has
no place on our says

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
saying pineapple has no place on our
pizza pineapple has
no place on our says
come again don't come again no more come
again yes come again
it has no place it has
come again don't come again no more come
again yes come again
please go away please go
come again don't come again no more come
again yes come again
please go away please go

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple has no place
pineapple will never
pineapple will never
pineapple will never
