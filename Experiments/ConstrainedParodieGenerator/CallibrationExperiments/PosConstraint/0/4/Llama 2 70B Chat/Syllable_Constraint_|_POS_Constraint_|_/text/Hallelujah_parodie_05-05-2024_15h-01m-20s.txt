[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's a crime against humanity
it's like putting ketchup on a
the flavors clash and the textures
don't mix it's a culinary abom

[Chorus]
ain't nothing holy about
pineapple on a pizza ain

[Verse 2]
they say variety is thespice
of life but some things just don't
belong together it's like trying to mix
oil and water they just won't
blend it's like a sin against nature
or at least against the culinary arts

[Chorus]
ain't nothing holy about
pineapple on a pizza ain

[Verse 3]
you may think you're being advent
with your hawaiian pizza dream
but to me it's just a travesty it's like
putting peanut butter on a pizza
crust it's like a sacrilegious
act against the pizza gods up above ap

[Chorus]
ain't nothing holy about
pineapple on a pizza ain

[Verse 4]
I know we all have our own
preferences when it comes to to
pizza toppings but some things are just not meant
to be it's like putting pickles
on a chocolate cake it's just not
right it's like a crime against humanity

[Chorus]
ain't nothing holy about
pineapple on a pizza ain
ain't nothing holy about
pineapple on apizza ain
ain't nothing holy about
pineapple on apizza ain
ain't nothing holy about
pineapple on apizza ain
ain't nothing holy about

[Outro]
pineapple on apizza ain

[Additional Lyrics]
remember when we used to
eat pizza with just cheese and sau
and maybe some pepperoni or sausage
but pineapple never crossed our minds
cause it just don't belong there
like a fish out of water it's just not right ap

[Additional Lyrics]
and don't get me started on
the combination of sweet and
savory it's like putting maple syrup
on a steak it's just not meant to be
it's like a culinary ab
omination it's like a sin against nature

[Additional Lyrics]
I know some folks will disag
ree with me and say that pineap
ple on pizza is the bomb but to me it
s just a no go it's like putting ran
ch on a pizza it's just not right
it's like a crime against humanity an long
