pack up your pineapple leave
your tastebuds will thank you and
your wallet too won't be depleted
oh no I can't believe you

[Chorus]
with pineapple pizza it's a crime
don't ruin the flavor just
pineapple has no place on a
dough that's supposed to be holy
a hawaiian invention gone
wrong mosquito my apetite

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I've had enough of the sweet
and sour combination
I want my pizza unsweetened
and my tastebuds untainted

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
with pineapple pizza it's a crime
don't ruin the flavor just
pineapple has no place on a
dough that's supposed to be holy
a hawaiian invention gone
wrong mosquito my apetite

[Post-Chorus]
yeah hey yeah
