[Verse 1]
just a pizza lover living in a world of
pineapple on pizza haters nationwide
she took a bite of pepperoni going now
her taste buds crying out in agony ton

[Verse 2]
a pizza topping on a quest
the scent of failure in the air
for a flavor they can share the
night it goes on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
arguments wait
up and down the comment chain
the hate for pineapple searching
in every
post it never ends it goes on
andonandonandonand

[Verse 3]
working hard to make a point
anti pineapple activ
paying anything to prove them wrong
just one more time

[Verse 4]
some will agree some will
disagree some are born to
fight for pizza freedom oh
the battle never ends it goes on

[Pre-Chorus]
arguments wait
up and down the comment chain
the hate for pineapple searching
in every
post it never ends it goes on
andonandonandonand

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
hold on to that belief
keep on fighting for the
right pizza to
pping hold on don't stop
belie
ving hold on to
that feeling pineapple
has no place on a pie
don't stop bel
