[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I remember the che
that stretched for miles and miles to order
but then came the pineapple
now my stomach churns and boils forever
one minute my tastebud
were dancing with delight next
the flavors were in shambles disarray
and pineapple was the one to blame la la

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
my pizza my pizza why hast thou for
saken me pineapple on top of
my pizza my pizza why hast
thou forsaken me never an honest
bite and that was when I ruled the world
not a single pineapple
upon my slice kingdom

[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a curious craving
binge that hit me out of the blue
I thought pineapple would be nice on

just a puppet on a lonely string oh ma
oh who would ever want pineapple

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
my pizza my pizza why hast thou for
saken me pineapple on top of
my pizza my pizza why hast
thou forsaken me never an honest
bite and that was when I ruled the world
not a single pineapple upon may
slice kingdom but now it
s just a memory never
