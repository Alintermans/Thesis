[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
it should never be in the
such a sweet and savory sight
but it doesn't belong

[Verse 1]
can't you see it's a crime against culinary
putting something tropical
on a pie that's meant to be
made with cheese and pepperon
not some exotic fruit from the
there's a time and a place for that
ain't no pineapple on
my pizza forevermore ain't gonna be
getting enough of that sweetness is a
my taste buds please don't torture me please don't put it on my pie
or my pasta or my sal
fried rice or my stir fry or
my sushi roll or my tacos or my burrito
just no pineapple on my plate

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie should never be in the
such a sweet and savory sight in my opinion
it's a crime against culinary good sense won't you agree
hey pineapple lovers please

[Verse 2]
I know some of you might be thinking
eharmony to combination
but let me tell you why it's wrong to combine
that tropical flavor with savory
my tastebuds cannot ab
your pineapple pizza should be
with its own toppings separate
its own identity and

[Verse 3]
don't get me wrong I love pineapple as much as the
next person but not on my pie or past
if you want to be my friend you gotta respect
my culinary preferences and don
now bring on the cheese and pepperoni
but save the pineapple for the beach
its got its own special time and place won't you agree with
me pineapple on a pie should never be in the
such a sweet and savory sight in my opinion that
aint no a crime against culinary good

[Outro]
my pizza forevermore
ain't gonna be getting enough
of that sweetness is a crime
my tastebuds please don't torture me
