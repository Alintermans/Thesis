[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
pineapple does not belong
on a pizza any
song and we all know it
please don't bring it to
roast to attention
or pass around it che
it's just not its place my friend no matter how we pace

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go pineapple
how much your will to chance
not looking for someone with fruit
superpowers to arrange
just something plain and
someone I can eat
I want something just like this
please don't disagree
my taste buds always at ease

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh pineapple please don
something just like this
oh pineapple okay
oh pineapple do anything
just don't put it on
top of my pizza
ps classrooms apple trees
we all know the score when it comes
our taste preferences

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
we move on to the topic
of pizza toppings gal
oregano basil
the possibilities
but sticklers insists rice
no room for their vicea
let's keep it simple folks that's the way to go

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go again let
when it comes to toppings
my mustered never exceeding
not looking for someone with
a crutch attitude
just something plain and
down homey my dear amused
tears my eyes open wide

[Chorus: Chris Martin]

[Bridge: Chris Martin]

time spent in hawaii
sizzling summer
day passes day passes
night passes night passes still no

not looking for someone with

just something simple
my hearty my dear amused
turnings my eyes open
wide with delight when it comes

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
