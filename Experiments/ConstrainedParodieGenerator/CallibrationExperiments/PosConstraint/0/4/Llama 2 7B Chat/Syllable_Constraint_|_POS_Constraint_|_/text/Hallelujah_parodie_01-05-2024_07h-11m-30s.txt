[Verse 1]
oh pineapple on a pizza oh
no no no no it just don't go
it clashes with the cheese and the pepperoni
it makes a mess of the toppings
it's like a musical chord that
just doesn't resolve in harmony oh yeah

[Chorus]
pineapple oh pineapple how
we don't want you on our

[Verse 2]
you adorn the margherita with
your sweet and tangy graceful ways
but leave the pizza plain and simple minded
its called a pizza not a fruit
we came here for a savory treat
not a tropical delight that makes us hes

[Chorus]
pineapple oh pineapple how
we don't want you on our

[Verse 3]
our predicament is quite
your wedged between the sausage and
the pepperoni they don't mix with you
a pineapple on a pizza is like
a kangaroo in a tutu
it just doesn't make any sense to us oh

[Chorus]
pineapple oh pineapple how
we don't want you on our

[Verse 4]
our taste buds beg to differ
you bring a flavor so unique and
our pizza won't be complete without
and when we think of pizza we
don't associate it with
pineapple oh pineapple how could you do

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza

[Outro]

[Additional Lyrics]
oh pineapple on a pie
oh pineapple on a crust made
oh pineapple on a savory delight
oh pineapple on a topping list that
oh pineapple on a menu
oh pineapple on a pizza night oh yeah oh

[Additional Lyrics]
a rose by any other name
would smell just as sweet as before
but pineapple on a pizza is not the
way to go my friend oh no oh no
it's like putting ketchup on a
steak it just don't belong oh yeah oh yeah oh

[Additional Lyrics]
so come on pineapple let
us enjoy our pizza in
style without your tropical twist oh yeah oh
let's keep it simple and savory and
our predicament is quite clear
oh pineapple on a pizza oh no oh no
