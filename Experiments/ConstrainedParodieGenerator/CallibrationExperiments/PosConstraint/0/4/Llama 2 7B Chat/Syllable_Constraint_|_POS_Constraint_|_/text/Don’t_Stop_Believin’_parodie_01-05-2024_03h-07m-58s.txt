[Verse 1]
don't put the pineapple on my pizza pie
its flavor just doesn't cut it like the che
a topping so wrong can't deny that it makes
my stomach turn inside out with disgust ya

[Verse 2]
it's sweetness overpowers the
savory flavors of the sau
cheese and pepperoni in a
clash of tastes that can't be ignored

[Pre-Chorus]
cooking up a
storm of flavors that'll leave
you wanting more and more and more
cooking up a
mouthful of delightful toppings
blend of flavors in perfect

[Verse 3]
pineapple has zero place
on a pizza where it doesn
plainly doesn't belong no matter
however you

[Verse 4]
the toppings may vary
the classic combination
never fails to satisfy
my taste buds yearning for aroma

[Pre-Chorus]
cooking up a
storm of flavors that'll leave
you wanting more and more and more
cooking up a
mouthful of delightful toppings
blend of flavors in perfect

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
save the pineapple for
its own special dish don
people stressin
save the pineapple for
its own
pepperoni
save the pineapple for
its own special way don
people stressin
