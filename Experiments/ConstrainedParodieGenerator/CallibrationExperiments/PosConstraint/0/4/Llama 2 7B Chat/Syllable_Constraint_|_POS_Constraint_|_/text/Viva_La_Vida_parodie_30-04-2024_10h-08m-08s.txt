[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
pineapple on a pie
makes me wanna cry and wonder
why would anyone think it's a good
idea to put fruit on

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
it goes against the gra
natural order of things you see
people with taste don't put
fruit on a savory dish like pizza
it just doesn't make any
sense to meeee eeee eeee eeee e
or her or him or them or anyone
that's why pineapple should not be on a pie

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells are ringin' still no
arguments for pineapple on a
pizza I hear I hear I hear
they just don't make any sense to me
never an honest word did I hear
pineapple should not be on
a pizza no no no
or any other dish for that

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
my grandmother always said it
don't put anything on a
pizza that doesn't belong on a
piece of crust made of flour and water
people want their pizza to
taste good and be satisfying
when they take a bite that's savory and true
putting pineapple on a pizza

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells are ringin' still no
arguments for pineapple on a
pizza I hear I hear I hear
they just don't make any sense to me
never an honest word did I hear
pineapple should not be on a pizza
how could it ever be
or any other dish for that

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohh ohh ohh go away
ohoh ohh go away
mmmummy mummy listen
I don't want to hear

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
jerusalem bells are
ringin' still noarguments for pineapp
on a pizza I hear
I hear I hear I hear I heari
reason why pineapple
should not be on a pizza no
no no no no no no
or any other dish for that matter
oh no no no no no
that's why pineapple should not be on
a pizza or any
other dish for that matter no no no
no no no no no no
or any other dish for that

[Outro]
