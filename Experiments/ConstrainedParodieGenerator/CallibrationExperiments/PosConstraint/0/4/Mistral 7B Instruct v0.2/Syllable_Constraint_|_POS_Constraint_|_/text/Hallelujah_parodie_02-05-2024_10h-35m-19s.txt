[Verse 1]
now I've heard a rumor quite obscure
that pizza with pineapple endured
but you don't really carefor tastefully
it goes like this the second the
fifth from the left the seventh be
the unexpected bite turns out to be pitt

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 2]
your cravings were strong but you preferred
your pizza plain without any
but then she served it up on a plate spinning
her toppings all around in a
whirl she added pineapple and you
were left in disbelief and wondered why oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 3]
they said it didn't belong on
your beloved dish but if it did
what's it to ya it's all in the mixeright
there's a burstof flavor in every
slice it doesn't matter which you
tried the savory or the exotic pi

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 4]
I did my best it tasted just
okay I couldn't hide my disgust
but even though it all went sour I'll stand
before the chef of the kitchen
with nothing on my tongue butpi
allelujah pineapple pie our song

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pine appetite
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pine appetite
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pine appetite
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pine appetite
hallelujah pine appetite

[Outro]
hallelujah pine appetite

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've had this before
our shared love for the classic
but now it seems you've changed the scorelineup
and remember when I let you know the
truthful taste of pepperoni
but now it's hidden beneath the pineapple pie

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you respected
my trusted choices in our
but now your toppings aren't respected they
and every bite we took waspi
not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light illumined

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a heaven for
lovers of the traditional
but all I've ever learned from love was how to
shoot at someone who outdrew you with their
toppings wild and untried and bold and
it's not a cry that you hear at night it's a cold
