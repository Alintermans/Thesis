[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been thinking tales of old
of debates and silly
pi√±a colada and
pizza with pineapple
dominoes down the
street pizza'sility
but I'm not the kind of eater that it suits style wise

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she queried shyly standing
there next to the counter
my tastebuds aren't seeking
for a tropical flower
a simple pizza
an ordinary
just something my palate can
embrace our dinner
I want something truly de

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
want something differ ant
want something differ
want something differ ant
oh we want something truly de
want somethingiffer
want something differ
want somethingiffer
oh we want something differently
I want something differently

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been thinking tales profound
of arguments and the
anchovies and olives
pizza with pineapple
margherita rolls out
an absurdity lif
but I'm not the type that fits this strifeful

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she gazed at me curiously
then gesticulated
my predilection not refined
for this unusual fru
a vegetari
an ordinary
just something my tastebud
appreciation he

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
want something differ ant from
yourself being fruitful too

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh we want something differently
rhyme schemes matter toodo
rhyme schemesatter
rhyme schemas matterto
oh we want something differently
rhype schemes matter tonight
rhyme schemesatta
rhyme schemesatterton

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
so where do you want
your pizza to go to
my taste buds don't want any
pineapple's fruity hue I
want something simple
a normal cheese base
just something my tastefully
comfort my elledged
I want something truly de

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
want something differ ant from the
pineapple's fruity confusion
oh we want something honestly
