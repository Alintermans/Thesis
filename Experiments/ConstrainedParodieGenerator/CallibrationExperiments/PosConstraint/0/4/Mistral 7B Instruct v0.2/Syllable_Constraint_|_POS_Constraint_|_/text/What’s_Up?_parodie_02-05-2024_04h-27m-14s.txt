[Verse 1]
twenty times I've tried pizza
struggling up that great big pie of despair
for an innovation
but pineapple intrusion left me quite
perplexed in this culinary scene of ours for
whatever that might be

[Pre-Chorus]
so I groan in the kitchen as I'm rolling the
dough to get it all out what's within me
and I weary am feeling a little malad
and so I open the fridge in the morning light then
take a deep whiff and contemplate aloud and
scream from the top of my lungs with a
frustrated shout

[Chorus]
and I cry outrage hey
look towards
I whispered hesitantlyhey
outrage hey look towards
pineapple
hey outrage hey look towards pine

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
and I taste
oh no pineapple do
I taste every
in this disasterpiece
and I curse
oh no pineapple do
I curse every single slice
for confusion dear

[Pre-Chorus]
so I groan in the kitchen as I roll out the
dough to get it all out my frustration
and I weary feel being a disappointed
and so I open the fridge in the morning light then
take a deep whiff and contemplate aloud and
scream from the top of my lungs with a
heretical

[Chorus]
and I plead anger hey
turn away
plead anger hey turn away

[Outro]
twenty times I've tried pizza
trying up that great big pie of potential
for an enhancement truly
