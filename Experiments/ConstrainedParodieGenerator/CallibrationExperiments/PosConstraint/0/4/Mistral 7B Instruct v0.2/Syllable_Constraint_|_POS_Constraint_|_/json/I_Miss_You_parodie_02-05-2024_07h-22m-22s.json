And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI blame you my beloved\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nhello there\nthe pineapple on our\nthe disturbance at the pizza party\nan ingredient unwel\non cheese and tomatoes lies\nour amicable relationship if\nwhere our beloved pizza\nand our shared delighted peace off\nin the night we'll cry dolefully this\nour beloved pizza\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI blame you my beloved\nI blame you my beloved\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere have you gone my dearest friend\nmy hatred for this fruit is deep tonight\nI need consistency and then\nthis controversial\nflavorless impediment comes creeping on\nand in my mind I counted\nthe reasons for this anat\nbe fruit on savory dishes it\nthat bring division and hatred\nwill you reconsider and\ntake it off before it ruins our\npizza night tonight\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't let yourself be tainted by it dear\nyou're already the voice\nmy desired pizza\n\ndon't let ourselves be tainted by it\nyou're already the voice\nmy desired pizza\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't let it ruin our pizza we\nthe voice inside our\nmy desired pizza\n\ndon't let it ruin our pizza we\nthe voice inside our\nmy desired pizza\n\nlet's keep our culinary dreams alive\nthe voice inside our\nmy desired pizza\n\nlet's keep our culinary dreams alive\nthe voice inside our\nmy desired pizza\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI blame you my beloved\nI blame you my beloved\nwe're already the voice\n",
