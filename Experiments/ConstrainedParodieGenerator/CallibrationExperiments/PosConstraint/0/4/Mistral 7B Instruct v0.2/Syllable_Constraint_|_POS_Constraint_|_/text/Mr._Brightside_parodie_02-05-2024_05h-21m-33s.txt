[Verse]
comin' out of my pie and I've been doin' nicely
gotta remember when pineapple just isn't
it started out so simple soused in tomato sauce
how did it end up with this unwelcome fruit cause
now I've lost my appetite and my taste buds are
he's slicing it up and she's spreading it wide and
they're enjoyin' their meal as I watch in despairing
and it's all because of

[Pre-Chorus]
but my pizza's perfection
his added ingredience
let me be
'cause I just can't feast my eyes on this he
and taken control

[Chorus]
jealousy turns a savory into
swimmin' through unexpected
choakin' on your unfairness
but it's just a sacrifice
pizza destiny is call
ing open up my open
'cause I'll be mr veg

[Guitar Solo]
