[Verse 1]
first things first
I've got an idea that's fruitfully
irritated and frustrated
pineapple on pizza dispute
pineapple on pizza dispute

[Verse 2]
second things second
keep your opinions to yourselves I plea'd with a
shrug of my shoulders and
my hatred for pineapple on their
pizzas grows stronger and stronger

[Pre-Chorus]
it started growing in my head
becoming a topic of debate
should it part of a delicious
pizza pie or a culinary blunder we dread
raising my voice above the noise
can't let this controversy
be our nation's latest cause
singing the praises of no pine

[Chorus]
painful it made me a believer
convincing reasons to
pineapple on pizza we'll never
agree forevermore
painful it made me a believer believe
we'll never agree forevermore
painful it made me a believer
painfulbelivery

[Verse 3]
third thinking
standing up for tradition and taste
another unwelcome
pizza topping it's a disgrace to the
heritage of our pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
our heated discussions
could we find a resolution
should we share our perspectives
can we find a compromise or
will it always be so caustic and divisive and
does it really matter in the grand scheme of things or is it
just a matter

[Chorus]
painful it made me a believer
convincing reasons to
pineapple on pizza we'll never
agree forevermore
painful it made me a believer believe
we'll never agree forevermore
painful it made me a believer
painfulbelivery

[Verse 4]
last matters
by the universal rule of taste and
our dedication to
a harmonious pizza
no longer pineapple on

[Pre-Chorus]
but our love for pizza unites us throughout the
yearning for the perfect combination of flavors and text
our heated

[Chorus]
painful it made me a believer
convincing reasons to
pineapple on pizza we'll never
agree forevermore
painful it made me a believer believe
we'll never agree forevermore
painful it made me a believer
painfulbelivery
