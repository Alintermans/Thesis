[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our beloved pizza dish
I savor every bite with
an uncontrollable

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to ponder something delicious
to construct my argument
against pineapple on top
do you slice it up neatly
or is it tossed carelessly in
upon my favorite pizza
when I specifically asked
for no pineapple at all I'd ask you please don
't add it to my slice unexpectedly
you ignore my every explicit plea that's not my preference
and I taste disappointment
can't understand your has
you obviously fail to comprehend my pizza
so if you really desire

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza I sav
our every bite with an uncontrollable
delight I wish it didn't have to be this way sighighighigh
I wish I could properly

[Verse 2]
it hangs there like a sore pineapple
smothering the flavors I adore
your disregard for my preferences is
as inconsiderate as it can be
I tried so hard to relate
to pineapple on pizza but
it's a combination that just
doesn't complement my taste

[Verse 3]
I won't bash those who enjoy pineapple on pizza
it's a matter of individual
preference and that's alright by me I'd never
impose my choices on their plate would be rude
so don't judge me for my stance alone
and let's appreciate the pizza
we can discuss every time we share a slice united
by our shared love for authentic ingredients
never putting pineapple in sight we bonded over
respectful choices and mutual respect

[Outro]
pineapple ruins our
toppings perfect harmony brought us
tired of your intrusion
just eat your own damn pizza alone yeah
yeah
shit hass
oh
yeah you
destroy
