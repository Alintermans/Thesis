[Verse 1]
don't put pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against human
ity and nature's lawsuits will
prosecute you for this faux pas with gleeful rel
you'll be the laughing stock of
the pizza world and beyond

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn from our mistakes
why do we always make the same blunder
of putting fruit on a
piece of bread and calling it a me
alright when it's clearly not right at all
we gotta get away

[Chorus]
stop your crying and listen to reason's call
pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza no matter how hard
you try to justify it with your fee
ble arguments and empty words
it's just not worth the fight so let

[Verse 2]
just give up and move on to something new and
better like pepperoni
or sausage or even ol

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn from our mistakes
why do we always make the same blunder
of putting fruit on a
piece of bread and calling it a me
alright when it's clearly not right at all
we gotta get away

[Chorus]
stop your crying and listen to reason's call
pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza no matter how hard
you try to justify it with your feeble
arguments and empty words it
just isn't worth the fight so let

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn from our mistakes
why do we always make the same blunder
of putting fruit on a
piece of bread and calling it a me
alright when it's clearly not right at all
we gotta get away

[Bridge]
we know better than to
listen to the hat
ers and trolls who say that
pineapple belongs
on a pizza they
just don't know what

[Outro]
stop your crying and join the resistance fight for
what's right and just and true
don't put pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against humanity and nature
we gotta get away from this
abomination and start an
ew pizza revolution now
