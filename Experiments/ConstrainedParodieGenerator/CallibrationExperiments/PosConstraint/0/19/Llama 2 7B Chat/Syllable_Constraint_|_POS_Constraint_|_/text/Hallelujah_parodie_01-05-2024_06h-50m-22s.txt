[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here
I know this topping it's a crime
I used to love it but now it's just a sin
and every time I see it on a
piece of crust I can't help but
shudder and say hallelujah halleluj

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time when I would put
it on my pizza with glee but
now I see the error of my ways oh no
it's a sin to put it on a pie
that's supposed to be savory
and tasty and fine but pineapple oh no oh

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
who loves pineapple on a pie
but all I've ever learned from love is that it
just doesn't belong on a pizza oh
no no no no no no no no no
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
