[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie
it's a crime against humanity
cannot be justified by any
it's a fruit that's
just not meant to be on a pie
it's like putting ketchup
on a perfectly good steak frites
the flavors just don'
don't align in any way shape
or form it's like trying to put
a cat in a bathtub it just don
not compute pineapple on a pie
it's like a sin against the
god of culinary delight
it's a crime against taste

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh oh
amen amen

[Chorus]
don't take me
to the pizza place where they put pineapple on
the pie it's a sacrilegious act of culmin
I can't worship at that
altar of abomination it
goes against all
that I hold dear and true pineapple on a pie
it's like a blasphemy against the holy roll
of cheese and sauce and pepper
it's a crime against the pizza gods

[Verse 2]
I know some may say it's just a fruit
but they're wrong it's a sin
of the highest order it's like
putting ketchup on a hot
dog it just don't make no sense to
put pineapple on a pie it
goes against the natural
order of things it's like a
breach of culinary contract
I won't stand for it I won
won't worship at

[Chorus]
don't take me
to the pizza place where they put pineapple on
the pie it's a sacrilegious act of culmin
I can't worship at that
altar of abomination it
goes against all
that I hold dear and true pineapple on a pie
it's like a blasphemy against the holy roll
of cheese and sauce and pepper
it's a crime against the pizza gods

[Bridge]
I know some may say it's just a preference but
I won't be swayed by their empty words and empty ple
arguments it's a sin of the highest order
it's a culinary crime against humanity

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh oh oh
amen amen

[Chorus]
don't take me
to the pizza place where they put pineapple on
the pie it's a sacrilegious act of culmin
I can't worship at that
altar of abomination it
goes against all
that I hold dear and true pineapple on a pie
it's like a blasphemy against the holy roll
of cheese and sauce and pepper
it's a crime against the pizza gods
