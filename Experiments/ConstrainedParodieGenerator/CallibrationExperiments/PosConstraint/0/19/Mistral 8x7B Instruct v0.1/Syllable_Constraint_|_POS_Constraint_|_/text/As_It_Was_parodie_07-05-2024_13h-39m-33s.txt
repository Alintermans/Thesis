[Intro]
come on now folks and give an ear to me a tale

[Verse 1]
taste sensation
pineapple's got no place
on a pizza it just doesn't belong ith
its sweetness ruins the taste space
silent protest
when cheese and tomato sauce is
the combo we love the most
pineapple's just not welcome here folks oh

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
it's not the same as it was before
in this dish it's just us
it's not the same as it was before
as it was as it was
it's just not the same

[Verse 2]
make the call out
to the pizza police now
demanding justice for this crime scene of
a pizza topped with pineap
ring the alarm
and let the pizza lovers know
that pineapple's got to go
it's just not the same as it was before oh

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
it's not the same as it was before
in this dish it's just us
it's not the same as it was before
as it was as it was
it's just not the same

[Bridge]
stay in your place pineapple don't inv
ade where you don't belong in life or pizza pie
take your sweetness elsewhere we don't want
your kind here ruining our slice of life oh no

[Outro]
as
it was it
just not the same as it was before
as it was as it was
