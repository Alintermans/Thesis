[Intro]
pineapple on pizza pie oh say is

[Verse 1]
once the box was opened wide
cheese and sauce mixed with pineapple
taste and smell together coll
your stomach turns and

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hours later ills of heartburn
you see the evidence of your mistake in the toilet bowl
you dream of a pepperoni slice before it hit your soul
you search for something savory to replace the sweet and sour

[Chorus]
was it over when you took that first bite oh
was it over when you realized the mistake
you whispered to yourself this is
a disaster in the making oh
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
oh say is it really

[Verse 2]
when you lost your dignity
red sauce stains on your shirt
blue mood from a bad dessert
your new slice is a bar

[Bridge]
and did you think I wouldn't notice
the pineapple chunks
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza without
only rumors of my love for pine
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hours later ills of heartburn
you see the evidence of your mistake in the toilet bowl urns of pain
you dream of a margherita slice before it hit your soul
you search for something savory to replace the sweet and sour

[Chorus]
was it over when you took that first bite oh
was it over when you realized the mistake
you whispered to yourself this is
a disaster in the making oh
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
oh say
is it really worth it
oh say
is it really

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
the pineapple chunks
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza without
only rumors of my love for pine
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come running urns of
pain and say the one thing I've been wanting but

[Outro]
oh say is it really
worth it to put pineapple on pizza pie oh say is it
really worth it oh say is it really
worth it oh say is it worth
it oh say is it worth
it oh
was it over then and is it over now oh
