[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my appetite at the table
that monstrosity should not be allowed now

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet deception and my wide eyes' shocking gaze
we're arguing online and losing our
cool over something that shouldn't be on
a pizza base anyway despite the trend

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that taste is not coming back
and I might be okay but I'm not having that
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that little slice of
a pizza pie that should not be combined with sweet and tangy
toppings that don't belong
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter your face turning pale seeing
the pineapple chunks staring back at you in disgust and regret you
should have stuck to the classic pepperoni and mushroom com
bo and you were thinking on the delivery ride
how could they do this to a classic italian dish and then
you wonder where the love went to as you reach for
the pizza box and all you feel is disgust and shame
and you remember it all too well yeahhhhhaaahhhhhaaaaahhhhhaaaaahhhhha
and you call the pizza place up
just to complain and they say they're sorry but
it's policy to offer
the customer whatever they want on their pizza and
you say that's bullshit and they say they understand but

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again in the middle of the night
we're arguing in the kitchen in the refrigerator
light about how pineap
ple on pizza is a sin and
you say it's a delicacy and I say it's a
travesty and we both know it's true and we both know it
all too well yeahhhhhaaaaahhhhha
and there it is again when no one

[Bridge]
has to know you keep ordering it just
to prove a point and I keep
eating it just to make you happy but
deep down I know it
should not be on a god
damn pizza and you call me up
again just to fight about it and I say I'm sorry but
I can't take it anymore and you say you understand
but you're still gonna order it anyway and
I'll still eat it just to make you

[Verse 4]
happy but I'll never admit it's good and I'll keep
pretending it's a joke but deep down we
both know it's not and we'll keep pretending it is and we'll keep eating
it just to prove a point and
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed in
disgust and I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to
forgive you for putting pineapple
on pizza and you say you're sorry but
it's just a prank and
I say that's not funny and you say I don
't have a sense of humor and I say that's not the
point and you say I'm overreacting and I say that's not the
point and you say you're sorry and I say

[Verse 5]
I forgive you but please never do it again
and you say you won't and you keep my old scarf from that very first
time we ordered pizza and you put pineapple on
it and it reminds you of a mistake and it
smells like regret and you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well yeahhhhhaaaaahhhhhaaaaahhhhhaaaaahhhhha
and you call me up again
just to apologize and I say

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again when I loved you so
back before you ruined the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well wind in my hair you were
there you remember it
all too well down the stairs
you were there you remem
ber it all too well it
was rare you were there you remem

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at keeping my cool but the punch line
goes I'll get over it but your pineapple
topped pizza stays a sore subject and did
the pineapple chunks ruin the pizza for
you just between us did the love for
pizza die too and just between us do you rem
ember it all too well just
between us I remember it all too
well wind in my hair I was there
I was there down the stairs I was

[Outro]

was rare you remember it all too well wind in mi
hair I was there I was there down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there it
was rare you remember it all too
