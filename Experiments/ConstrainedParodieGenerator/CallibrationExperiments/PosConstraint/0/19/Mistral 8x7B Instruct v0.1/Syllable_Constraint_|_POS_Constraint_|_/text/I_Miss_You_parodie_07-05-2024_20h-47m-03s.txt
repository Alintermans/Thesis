[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
please forego
this notion of pineapple
on pizza below's the reason why it
should not be on displayed plate
we can live like cat and dog
if we want to ignore this factual note
and we'll have a fit on full
display when you take that first bite mate
and in the night we'll regret this choice we
made tonight tonight we

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the ham that once was there now
it's nowhere in sight tonight I search in
vain for the taste that I once knew
and as I stare at
this monstrosity I'm eating I see the
webs of lies spun by those who
claim it's a delicacy
will you come to your senses and stop
this abomination now it
should not be on display it
should not be on display it's a shameful
choice tonight tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on this monstrosity
it's not a real pizza
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time on this monstrosity
it's not a real pizza
I despise it I desp

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on this monstrosity
it's not a real pizza
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time on this monstrosity
it's not a real pizza
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time on this monstrosity
it's not a real pizza
I despise it I desp
don't waste your time on this monstrosity
it's not a real pizza
I despise it I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
