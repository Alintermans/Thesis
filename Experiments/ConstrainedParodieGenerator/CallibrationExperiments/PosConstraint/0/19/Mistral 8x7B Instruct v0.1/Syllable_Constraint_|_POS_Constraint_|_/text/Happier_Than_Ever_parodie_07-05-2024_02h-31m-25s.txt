[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue and mad
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just shouldn't be

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a parody verse
to tell you why it's such a
faux pas to put pineapple
on a pizza you adore it
but I'm here to set it straight for
you and others like you who
don't know any better yet don't say it
isn't true it's just a fact that it's a
travesty on a pizza pie don't you see it too yeah you do
and I know you'll come around
to my way of thinking soon
cause it's just not right to put pineapple on pizza
it's a crime against the foodie

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue and
mad wish I could explain it clearer but it just shouldn
't be true mmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmh
mmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmm

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask me why it
can't be on a pizza I say
it's just not done it's a sin to put it on
a pizza you insist that it's fine but
I won't back down
I don't relate to you no
I don't relate to you no
it's a disgrace to pizza

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about it on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
cause that shit's embarrassing it's a travesty
on a pizza pie it's a sin to do it
so don't waste your time trying to change
my mind it's just not right to put pine
apple on a pizza it's a crime against the foodie yeah
and I won't stand for it no way no how nope no
way no how nope no way no how nope no way no how no
way no how nope no way no how nope no way

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
always said it was misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just leave my pizza alone yeah leave it
al
one leave
it
alone
leave it
