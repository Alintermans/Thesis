[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I realized quickly when I took a bite
that pineapple's a culprit that just doesn't fit right
it's time to set things straight

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm dining in bed
just to spit it out what's in my head and
I feel a little peculiar when I see it
and so I wake in the morning and I open wide
and I take a deep breath and I swallow it
and I scream from the bottom of den
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on with
my pizza today hey
hey hey hey
hey hey hey I said hey what's wrong

[Bridge]
ooh o

ooh uh u
oh o
oh

[Verse 2]
and I fight
oh my god do I fight
I fight every
time I take a bite of
this monstros
and I pray oh my god
do I pray every day for
a better way to

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm dining in bed
just to spit it out what's in my head and
I feel a little peculiar when I see it
and so I wake in the morning and I open wide
and I take a deep breath and I swallow it
and I scream from the bottom of den
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on
and I say hey
hey hey hey
hey hey hey I said hey what's wrong
and I say hey hey hey
wake in the morning and open wide
take a deep
and I scream from the bottom of den
what's going
on and I say hey hey hey hey
open wide and take a
and I scream from the bottom of den
what's going on hey
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

[Outro]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate oh
