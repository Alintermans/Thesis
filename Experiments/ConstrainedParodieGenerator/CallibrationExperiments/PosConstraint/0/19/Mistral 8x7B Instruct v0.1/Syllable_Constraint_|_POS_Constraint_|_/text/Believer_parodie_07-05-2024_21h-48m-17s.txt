[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
its taste is a cursea unpleas
ure oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
unpleas oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
second things second
ham and pineapple's a combo absurdi√±eer
but don't you dare tell
me it's tasty or I'll
shiver in disgust oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on pizza pies so
fine with cheese and tomato sauce flow
writing this parody for the
many who know pineapple's a no no no no no
singing my message loud and clear
pineapple's taste is something to
fear oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
fear oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer in
good pizza without pine
pain you break me down with every
slice that has pineapple
pain you made me a believer in good food
pain oh let the pineapple stay far
away oh let it never come near
pain you made me a bel

[Verse 3]
third things third
hold the pineapple and add mushrooms
ham and pineapple is
a culinary sin oh oh oh oh
a culinary sin oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on pizza great
but pineapple on pizza is
a mistake oh oh oh oh
making me wanna run away
but it never did ever leave my mind until it
disappeared oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
disappeared oh

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer in
good pizza without pine
pain you break me down with every
slice that has pineapple
pain you made me a believer in good food
pain oh let the pineapple stay far
away oh let it never come near
pain you made me a bel

[Verse 4]
last things last
pizza with pineapple is a thing of
the past oh oh oh oh oh
a thing of the past oh oh
pizza with pineapple is

[Pre-Chorus]
a thing of the past oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer in
good pizza without pine
pain you break me down with every
slice that has pineapple
pain you made me a believer in good food
pain oh let the pineapple stay far
away oh let it never come near
pain you made me a bel
