[Verse]
emerging from my denial and I've been doing
just fine without pineapple on my pizza pie
started out a classic way but then it went awry ol
lah lah lah lah lah lah lah
now I'm lying awake with a stomach full of
regret and a slice that should have never been put
on my plate and now I'm feeling blue and sickly
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're eating it now with
smiles all around and it
just makes me
want to scream and shout and throw it outta
my sight and out of

[Chorus]
disgust turning foodies into my fo
es as I push away this
monstrosity
swimming in a sea of cheese
and marinara sauce and
it's just not worth the taste it
leaves in my mouth and

[Guitar Solo]
