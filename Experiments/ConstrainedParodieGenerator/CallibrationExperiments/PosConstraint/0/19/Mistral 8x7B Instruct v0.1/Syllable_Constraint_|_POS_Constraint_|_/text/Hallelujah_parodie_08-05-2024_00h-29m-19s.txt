[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for it do ya barn
it goes like this the dough the sauce
the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the tangy pineapple takes its turn and

[Chorus]
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again

[Verse 2]
your taste was bland but you sought delight
you saw the slice and thought it right
but it's a combo that just ain't right ya
it mixes sweet and savory
into a mess that's hard to carry
and leaves a bitter taste that's a real pity

[Chorus]
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again

[Verse 3]
you say it's just a trend that's in
I say it's just a sinful grin
but if you try it well really what's it to
me there's a flavor clash in every
bite it doesn't matter which you
get the sweet or the savory halleluj

[Chorus]
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again

[Verse 4]
I tried it once it wasn't much
I couldn't stomach it so I said
I've told the truth I didn't
come to chew ya and even though
it all went wrong I'll stand before
the pizza gods with nothing on my plate but

[Chorus]
oh no not again oh no not
pineapple on pizza again
hallelujah not again oh
no not again oh no not now
pineapple on pizza now no
way not now not ever again
hallelujah not again oh
no not again oh no not now
pineapple on pizza now no

[Outro]
hallelujah not again oh

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this slice I've tasted it
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pineapple on the pie
it's not a victory march it
sours the taste and leaves a broken halleluj

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I bit into
the pineapple and it turned to
soggy mush and left a bitter hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
is how to spit at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
