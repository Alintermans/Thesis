[Intro]
is this a bad pie or just a fantasy
caught in a conundrum with no room for propriacy
open your eyes and take a bite and see pier
I'm just a sane guy who's had enough of this
I'm not a fan of pineapple's sweetness here to dismissive
any way the slices fall doesn't really matter to me to

[Verse 1]
papa just killed my taste
put pineapple on my pizza and ruined my haste bum
papa life had just begun
but now I've gone and thrown my appetite
papa ooh didn't mean to make you grim
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on munching on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my slice is done
sent shivers down my spine tasted so wrong all the time
goodbye pepperoni I've got to go
gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
papa ooh I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd just
avoided this monstrosity all my life

[Guitar Solo]

scaramouche pineapple on my pizza dinner dish
thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
