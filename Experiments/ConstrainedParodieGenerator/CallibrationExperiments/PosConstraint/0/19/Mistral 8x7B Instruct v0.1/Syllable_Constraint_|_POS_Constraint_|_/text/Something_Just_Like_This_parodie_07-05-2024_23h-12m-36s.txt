[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni and cheese
but pineapple just won
through reputation
it doesn't deserve to
be on a pizza pie like this one does belong here

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said taste is subjective
and who am I to diss
I'm not looking for a topping
that's too exotic or flash
just something simple
that tastes good with a
crust that I can bite into
something I can relish
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
but pineapple just won
through reputation it
doesn't deserve to be
on a pizza pie like
this one does belong here no way no how no

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said taste is subjective
and who am I to diss
I'm not looking for a topping
that's too exotic or flash
just something simple
that tastes good with a
crust that I can bite into
something I can relish

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a topping
that's too exotic or flash
just something simple
that tastes good with a
crust that I can bite into
something I can relish
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
