[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie sitin' in the oven ton
a topping so wrong it's like a crime scene gone
pineapple's the culprit it's a flavor faux pas
it doesn't belong on a pizza that's just

[Verse 2]
a taste of hawaii in the
middle of italy it's just
a confusion of flavors that
makes no sense it's just not right ight ight

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waitin
up and down the menu list
their flavors searchin in the night
pizza lovers
livin just to find a slice that
tastes just right ight ight ight ight

[Verse 3]
workin hard to make a pie
that's perfect and divine but
pineapple's not the way to go it
just don't fit

[Verse 4]
some will win some will lose
some pizzas are born to
please the crowd but pineapple
isn't the way to go it's just not

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waitin
up and down the menu list
their flavors searchin in the night
pizza lovers
livin just to find a slice that
tastes just right ight ight ight ight

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin
hold on to that feelin
pizza lovers
don't stop believin
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop believin
hold on to that feelin
pizza lovers
