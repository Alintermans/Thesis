[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' with your crew every bite is
like a crime that sticks around like a taste
in your mouth that you can't shift
do you ever get that fear that you'll be
found out that pineapple doesn't belong on a pie
are there some flavors up your sle
that you're hidin' from
the world how many toppings can you take before you realize
'cause there's this pizza that I know that makes me think

[Pre-Chorus]
of you somehow and I can't believe that you
would do this to a beautiful pie like that baby
we both know that pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza and I'm hopin' that you'

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
way that pizza used to be
ever thought of
tastin' it with
a different
topping maybe you
are too used to the sweetness
of the pineapple
to fall for the flav

[Verse 2]
so have you got the gut
to take a bite of hawaiian pizza
and if so I wanna know what time it's served
simmer down and listen up I'm sorry to interrupt
it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to tell you
that pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza but
I don't know if you feel the same as I do

[Pre-Chorus]
of you somehow and I can't believe that you
would do this to a beautiful pie like that baby
we both know that pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza and I'm hopin' that you'

[Chorus]
but we could be together if you want
crawlin' back to the way that
pizza used to be ever
thought of tastin' it with a differ
ent topping maybe you're too used to the
sweetness of the pineapple to
fall for the flavor of a
classic margheri
now I've thought it through

[Outro]
crawlin' back to the way that pizza used to be
ever thought of tastin' it with a different to
pping maybe you're too used to the sweetness of the
pineapple to fall for the flavor of a classic
margherita do you want me crawlin' back to the
real pizza do you want me crawlin' back to
the way that pizza used to be do you want me crawlin
