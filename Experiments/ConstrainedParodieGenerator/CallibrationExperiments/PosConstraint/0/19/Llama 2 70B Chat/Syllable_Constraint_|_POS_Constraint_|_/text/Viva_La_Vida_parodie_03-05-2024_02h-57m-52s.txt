[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza
toppings would shine so bright and
now in the morning I feel alone
sweat the calories I used

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to be the king
of the pizza scene feel the fear in
my stomach's eyes listen as
the crowd would sing now the old slice is dead
long live the slice one minute
I held the cheese next the to
ppings were closed on me and I discovered
that my pizza stand upon pillars of salt

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear complaints a ringin' people cho
iors are singin' be my mirror ice
cream my sword and shield my stomach
missionaries in a foreign field for
some reason I can't explain once
you'd gone there was never an
honest slice and that was
when I ruled the pizza world ice

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild cra
ving blew down the doors to let me
in shattered diets and the sound of
rumblings people couldn't believe what
I'd become revolution
aries wait for my stomach on
a silver plate just a puppet on a lon
ely string mmm mmm aw who would e

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
