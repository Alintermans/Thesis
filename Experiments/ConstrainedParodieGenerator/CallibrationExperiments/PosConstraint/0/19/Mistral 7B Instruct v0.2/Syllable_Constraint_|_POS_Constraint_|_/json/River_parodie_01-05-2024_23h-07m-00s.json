He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker wearing a\npineapple on my pizza\nbeen a lover of unusual toppings we all know it\nall my sins need holy water from the pizza maker\nwell little one I don't want\nto admit to something so absurd and bizarre\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's bringing home a pineapple\nto face the criticism and\npineapple on his pizza plate is\nmismatched with the traditional spaghetti and\nit's a battle of taste buds clashin'\nshe just wants to exact revenge and rel\npineapple on his pizza is a crime she's detected\n'cause she loves tradition and balance and respect it is a testament\nit's a chess match of flavors\nshe's kept track of all the pizza orders past and present\nand guess who just happens to be orderin' a\npineapple pizza tonight and she has what my palate\nlacks craving for the familiar\nbut she's devised some plan to sabotage his taste bud\nknife in hand says our relationship's hangin' by a strand so\nshe's been on the web lately searching for a\npineapple hater to join her in her\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker wearing a\npineapple on my pizza\nbeen a lover of unusual toppings we all know it\nall my sins need holy water from the pizza maker\nwell little one I don't want\nto admit to something so absurd and bizarre\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one bite stand turned a two bite stand\nit was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and then\nhe found out now she feels deserted and used\n'cause he left so what he did it first to her too\nnow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through\nit's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and true\ndon't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth\ndon't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you\nso I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners don\nt have to be reserved in a booth but\nI just feel like the person I'm turning into's irre\nversible I preyed on you like it's pizza at the pew and now\nthat I got you I don't want you taking\nadvantage in my thirst to pursue but\nwhy do I do this dirt that I do\nget on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech\ndetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'cause now with her in the wom\nwe can't bring her in this world shoulda knew\nto use protection before I bit into your forbidden\ntop\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's ooh my name's o\npizza\no\nh river\nooh we'll let the\npizza run call me ooh call me o\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the bridesmaid never the bride hey\nfuck can I say if pizza was a free\nway and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in five\npizza pies speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin' on\nice maybe that's why I may have came at\nyou sideways I can't keep\nmy lies straight but I made you terminate\nmy baby this love triangle left us in a\nwreck tangled what else can I say it was fun\nfor a while but I really woulda\nloved your smile didn't really wanna abort\nbut what's one more lie to tell our unborn\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker wearing a\npineapple on my pizza\nbeen a lover of unusual toppings we all know it\nall my sins need\nholy sauce\n\nfrom the pizza maker well little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to\nsomething so absurd and bizarre truth and my lies\n",
