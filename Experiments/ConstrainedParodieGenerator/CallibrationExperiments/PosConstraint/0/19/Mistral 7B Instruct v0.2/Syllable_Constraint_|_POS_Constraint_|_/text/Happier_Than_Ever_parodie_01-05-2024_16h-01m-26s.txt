[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
pineapple just isn't

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to ponder what's
right for our savory
topping roster do we choose
do you prefer the classic
or do you pick the exotic
when you said you loved pineapple
was I even on your plate
I knew when I asked you to exclude it from your
topping selection you'd do the exact
opposite and I'd end up more annoyed than amused by your choice of
pineapple on my pizza
don't say it's not cruel
you clearly weren't aware that you ruined my meal
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza pie is
right and tasty tonight ight ight ight
wishing for a simpler life ight ight ight ight ight ight ight ight
pineapple just isn't right

[Verse 2]
you call me again with pineapple
topping on your slice so wide and round
it scares me to taste it but I'm wasting time
'cause you only listen to your fellow pine
appreciators I don't
I don't relate to you pine
'cause I'd never top my pizza this
unappetizingly with

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about pineapple on the web
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's just embarrassing it was my favorite
and all that you did was make me crave something
savory and delicious instead of
pineapple on my pizza pie so
don't waste the time I don't have left in this life and don
't try to make me feel bad for wanting a pizza that
tastes good without the intrusion of pineapple on it
I could talk about every time that you

[Outro]
you ruined every bite
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just leave me alone pineapple on the
side
goddam
god
leave me
alone
