[Verse 1]
twenty five years with this strange
tryin' to figure out the great pineapple
on a pizza scene oh
realized quickly when I took a bite and
saw this fruit on top was not quite right for me and mine
for whatever that means

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I am feeling a little peculiar and
so I wake in the morning and I step outside and
take a deep breath and I get real high and loud
screaming out my question to the crowd
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyeyey heyeyey
I said hey
what's going on with this piney
heyeyeyey heyeyey I said hey hey
what's going
on with this piney on my pie

[Bridge]

and I pine
oh my goodness do we
pine and pine again
in this kitchen scene and
we plea oh
oh my goodness do we
pray every single day for
pineapple peace and

and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head

screaming out my question to the crowd
