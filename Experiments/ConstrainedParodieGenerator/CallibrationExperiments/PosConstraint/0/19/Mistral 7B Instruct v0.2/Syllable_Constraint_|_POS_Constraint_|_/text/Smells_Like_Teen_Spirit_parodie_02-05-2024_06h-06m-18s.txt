[Verse 1]
load up on pizzas bringing
friends for a culinary bond
pineapple on top is the sinning trend
oh no I know a disgusting

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pie lovers gather near
hello pie lovers gather here
hello pie lovers gather close
hello pie lovers all

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less tasty
here we are now eating with ease
I feel foolish and contagious
here we are now eating with ze
a pineapple a tomato
a mushroom my dismay oh no

[Post-Chorus]
yum yum no

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I like best
and for this choice I feel blessed
our little group has always been
and always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pie lovers gather near
hello pie lovers gather here
hello pie lovers gather close
hello pie lovers all

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less tasty
here we are now eating with ease
I feel foolish and contagious
here we are now eating with ze
a pineapple a tomato
a mushroom my dismay oh no

[Post-Chorus]
yum yum no

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I taste
oh yeah I guess it makes me shake
I found it hard it's hard to find
oh well whatever let it slide

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pie lovers gather near
hello pie lovers gather here
hello pie lovers gather close
hello pie lovers all

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less tasty
here we are now eating with ease
I feel foolish and contagious
here we are now eating with ze
a pineapple a tomato
a mushroom my dismay oh no

[Outro]
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
