[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping frenzy with no escape from reality
open your eyes and gaze upon the pie's dec
I'm just a simple slice who needs no respect
because I'm easy eatin' easy meltin' little high or
low on the plate any way the sauce flows doesn't really matter

[Verse 1]
papa just added pine
plopped a ring of pineapple right in the middle then he
papa pizza life had just
begun but now I've gone and ruined it
papa ooh did not mean to make you sigh
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my taste has come
sends shivers down my palate every time I take
a bite goodbye my fellow diners all
gonna leave you all behind and face the truth
papa ooh any way the sauce flows
I don't wanna pine
sometimes I wish I'd never been served at all

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouette of a dish
pineapple tango pineapple tango will you do
the fusion dance and blend the flavors nice and tight or wrong
pizza chef galileo pizza chef galileo pizza chef figaro magnificento oh but
I'm just a simple slice from a simple pie
they're just a simple slice from a simple life
spare me my life from this monstrosity
easy come easy go will you let me go
papa will not let you go papa will
not let you go papa will not let you go let
me go papa will not let you go let me go
never never never never
never let me go oh mamma
mamma mia let me go beelzebub has a
topping put aside for me
for me for me oh mamma mia let me go let me go let
me go let me go let me go let me go let me go let me

[Verse 4]
so you think you can smother me and hide the taste
so you think you can love me and leave me to waste
oh baby can't do this to me baby
just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]
