[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clings like something in
the middle of your slice where it
should be cheese and tomato's
significance escapes you this week long ordeal of
how many food combinations
can you keep hidden
'cause there's this dish I found that makes me think of you somehow an' I
prepare it on repeat until I take a bite

[Pre-Chorus]
should I admit it now or hide it away from
the chef and diners who'd frown on this unusual
topping choice we both know that the nights were mainly
made for serving up surprises that may not last till

[Chorus]
dragging back the pine
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a
pineapple wine
'cause I always do
craving something new
but now I've thought it through drag
ing back the pine to
you with every

[Verse 2]
so have you got the
taste buds open wide enough to try this
and if so I want to know what flavor it
shuts off before I attempt to mix it up and surprise
you but we could enjoy this culinary adventure if
you're willing to be my partner in this pineapple
romance but I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
should I admit it now or hide it away from
the chef and diners who'd frown on this unusual
topping choice we both know that the nights were mainly
made for serving up surprises that may not last till

[Chorus]
dragging back the pineapple pie to you
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a few cravings
'cause I always do experimenting
maybe I'm too obsessed with
this tropical delight to fall
for the traditional ways
now I've thought it through
dragging back the pine

[Outro]
should I admit it now or hide it away from
the skeptics who'd frown on this unusual pairing
we both know that the nights were mainly made for sav
oring up new experiences that may not last
should I admit it now or hide it away from you
do you want me dragging back the pineapple pie to
do you want me dragging back the pineapple
