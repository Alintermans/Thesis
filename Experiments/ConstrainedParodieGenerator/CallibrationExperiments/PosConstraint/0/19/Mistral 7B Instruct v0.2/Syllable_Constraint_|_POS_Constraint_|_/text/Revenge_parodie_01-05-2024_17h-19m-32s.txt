[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a pizza topping that was sound
but now I see the error of that
pineapple on a pizza
you agree

[Verse]
I've ordered pies with ham and pe
pepperoni and olives galore but now I see the
oh man what a world the things I've seen
if I could remove that pineapple from the
scene would I do it again some
add pineapple some add anchovies some add pineapple
and you'd have thought that I would let it be
but I can't let it go it ruins the harmony of
my pizza pie I've ordered it
I've ordered pies with ham and peppers galore but now I
see the error of that pineapple
oh man what a world the things I've seen If I
could remove that pineapple from
the scene would I do it again some add pineapple some
add anchovies some add pineapple and
you'd have thought that I would let it be but I can't let it

[Chorus]
let it go let it
go let it go let
it go let it go let it
go let it go let
go let it go let it go
go let it go let

[Outro]
let it go let it
go let it go let it
go let it go let it
go let it go let it go let
go let
