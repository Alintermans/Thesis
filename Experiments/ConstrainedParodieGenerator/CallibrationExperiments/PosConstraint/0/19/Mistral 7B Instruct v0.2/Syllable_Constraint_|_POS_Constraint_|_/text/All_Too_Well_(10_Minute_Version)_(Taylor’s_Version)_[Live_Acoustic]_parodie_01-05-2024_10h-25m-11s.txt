[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you under the bright
pineapple on the pizza seemed such a fright
but I left my palate pure at your brother
's house and you've still got it in your fridge tonight

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple's sweet disposition and my puzzled
gaze we're arguing in the car about this
topping falling down like pieces into place or
is it just a mistake that we can't miss

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
this argument's not here no
more but I'm not fine at all oh oh ohhhhhh nooooohhoh
it's just a

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red because you were looking at the pine
apple on your pizza pie
wind in my hair I was there oh

[Verse 3]
photo album on the counter your face was turning red
you used to be a little kid with a pineapple obsession in
a twin sized bed and your mother's telling stories about you
on the pineapple pizza team you told me about
your past thinking pineapple was the key to our future
and you were tossing me the pizza slice keys we
were always ordering out and I was thinking on
the drive home any time now he's gonna say it's love but
you never called it what it was
'til we were dead and gone and buried check the pulse
and come back swearing it's the
same after three months in the grave and then you wondered where
it went to as I reached for you but all I felt was

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light pineapple on the
counter I was there oh oh oh
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
ath sacred prayer and we
'd swear to remember it all too well

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you ruined it all
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to argue like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you change my mind you said
if pineapple had been closer in taste maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to pine
the idea you had of me who was she
a never picky never satisfied pineapple lover whose cravings
reflect on you not weeping in a
party bathroom some actress asking me
what happened you pine
that's what happened you pineapple on my heart
you who charmed my dad with self deprecating jokes
sipping soda like you're on a late night show but then he watched me
watch the pineapple pizza all night willing you to come

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old pineapple from that very
first week cause it reminds you of innocence and it
smells like me you can't get
rid of it cause you remember it

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapple stays the
same from when your pineapple broke my skin
and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half
your appetite and did the pine flame
bruise paint you blue just between us did the love aff
air maim you too cause in this
city's barren cold I still remember
the first fall of snow and how it
glistened as it fell iremem

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it just between us all too well
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all too well
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all too well

[Spoken Outro]
I love you guys so much
