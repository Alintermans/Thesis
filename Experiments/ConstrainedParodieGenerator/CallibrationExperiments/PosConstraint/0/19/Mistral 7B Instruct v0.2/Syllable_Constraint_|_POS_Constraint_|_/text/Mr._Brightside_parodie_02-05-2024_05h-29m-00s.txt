[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta hide from the sun because I hate pineap
it started out on a pie but now it's on a pizza
what was once a delight now leaves me feelin' diz
now I'm watchin' in shock as they top it with a
pineapple ring and I'm cringin' in despair and
now they're savourin' slices and my taste buds are
screamin' in despair and

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savourin' each bite
he takes a second help
let me go
I just can't partake in this crime scene
and ruin the meal

[Chorus]
pineapplesity turns good dishes to
swimmin' through savory ru
chokin' on your excuses
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin' me
open up my closed eyes and
'cause I'm mr sadside

[Guitar Solo]

comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine yet
gotta hide from the sun because I hate pineap
it started out on a pie but now it's on a pizza
what was once a delight now leaves me feelin' diz
now I'm watchin' in shock as they top it with a
pineapple ring and I'm cringin' in despair and
now they're savourin' slices and my taste buds are
screamin' in despair and

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savourin' each bite
she takes a second help
let me go

I never
