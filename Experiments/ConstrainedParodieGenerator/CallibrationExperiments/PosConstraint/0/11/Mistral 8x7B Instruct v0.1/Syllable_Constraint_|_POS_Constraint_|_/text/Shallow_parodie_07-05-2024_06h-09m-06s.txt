[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something''
is pineapple on pizza a thing
that you want or no
do you prefer a classic dough go

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I shiver
at the thought of pineapple on my pizza
without
a topping that's savory and hits

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
let me tell yaboy
can't we tousle ham and mushrooms toy boy
or chilliesthin what
does pineapple even bring to the plate

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
my stomach
turns at the sight of pineapple on pizza
that thing
and its sweetness grossly out of place

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
