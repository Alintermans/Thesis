[Intro]
I hope i, I hope I clearly
understand that pineapples don
ever belong on a pizza pie
is that just me or do you
agree too

[Verse]
its called a culinary sin
yes quite akin to heresy puttin' pineapple in
it makes my taste buds weep within oh
that sweet and savory combo makes me want
a different meal instead a
pineapple pizza is a crime against my tongue leaving
me to wonder why anyone would dare
but alas here we are with this monstrosity being served
its ruined my appetite I
feel deeply saddened by this abomination best left
for obscurity I no longer
want a part of it so in the garbage it
goes forgotten the way it should
have been from the very start its called a culinary
sin yes quite akin to heresy put
tin pineapple in it makes my taste buds weep within oh its

[Chorus]
in the garbage it
goes forgotten the
way it should have been wasted
from the very start
in the garbage it goes is
forgotten the way

[Outro]
that I consign it
its remembered only
let it rot it nothing
should arouse this ire rotation
etern
