[Verse]
stepgin' out of the groceries with my pineapple
wantkin' to bake but now I've lost my willpower
it began with a slice such a foolish mistake sighed sigh
it seemed so nice fresh pineapple on a pizza
now my kitchen's a mess and my willpower slim
at their will power's high letting pineapple win
now their creating a pizza topped with sin and
it's all in my head couldn

[Pre-Chorus]
but their faces happy now
my defeated demean
come on now
it's just killing the scene its getting obsc
and taking control

[Chorus]
envy spurtin'outa me towards that
pieces toppin under an
uhhhh to for what yayuh cheap sell
and its just enough no use
lettng go time to my I it
ca to I hungry pie let
as it can real side

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
but their putting extra pine
its adding onto it

within my so desire even
but lacking ould choice

[Chorus]
envy spurtin'outa me towards that
pieces toppin under an
uhhhh to for what yayuh cheap sell
and its just enough no use
lettng go time to my I it
ca to I hungry pie let
as it can real side
