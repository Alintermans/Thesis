[Intro]
hey there friends, we've got a message for you

[Verse 1]
haltin' our
hunger for pineapple on
our beloved pizza slice won't you re
consider leaving it alone
check your taste bud
never change should it ever be
in the toppings forever
but it damn well shouldn't be on pizza

[Chorus]
in this culinary
world it's just wrong to add pineapple
in this crowd it might just
ruin the pizza experience
that's just the way it is
it goes against sacred

[Verse 2]
make another
batch of pizza without pine
where is your reasoning behind combi
ning fruit with marinara
listeners call
but trust us when we say it all
we've tried it and it falls flat
your taste buds deserve better than that gotta

[Chorus]
in this culinary
world it's just wrong to add pineapple
in this crowd it might just
ruin the pizza experience
that's just the way it is
it goes against sacred

[Bridge]
chow yeah consume back iced java get things
he heard enough shouting about dumb pineapple at
party comeback one red can he he what
what canned pineapple do better than fresh what does fres

[Outro]
ah
under it
you bet your eating habits this bad
under hat will never
