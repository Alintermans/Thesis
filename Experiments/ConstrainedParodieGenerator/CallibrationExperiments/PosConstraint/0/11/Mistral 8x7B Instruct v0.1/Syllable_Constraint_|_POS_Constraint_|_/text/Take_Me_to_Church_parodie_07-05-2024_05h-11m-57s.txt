in the form of a strongly worded
plea imploringrestaurants to dis
card the notion of pineapple
on pizza pies instead insist
on keeping this monstros
ity off the menu at any
cost don't you dare des
ecrate the sanctity of pizza

we must draw the line some foods belongs
on a pizza and some do notend
of story let pineapple
stay off my pizza pie amen

[Chorus]

your putting pineapple on the menu offends
my sacred calling to defend pizza and its
beautified purity from

my pizza down
your putting pineapple on the menu without
my sacred calling to defend pizza and its
beautituted purity
from the likes of pineapple never

[Verse 2]
