[Verse 1]
I picked up a slice with pineapple there on
the greasy cardboard box felt so wrong somehow
but something said I should give it a try ith
but now I regret that I ever took a

[Verse 2]
oh they say pineapple's sweet disposition clashes
with savory tomato sauce on pizza
bitter fighting seems to be the after taste ling
ers long after it's all been digested yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
and I feel its ruined good
pizza forever will be
but I forced myself to eat it thinking maybe
it's just me

[Chorus]
because that's not what pizza's gotta be man
its too good all on its own can't you see that its our
childhoods in every bite
remember it right no pineap

[Verse 3]
ham salad asiago no way I ounce thought adding fresh
pineapple was a good idea now I'm hesitant to try new
toppings who knows what could go wrong it's best just to stick to class
ic topping combos like pepperoni and sausage
or my personal favorite bacon and bbq sauce
bet everyone after reading this refrains from
trying pineapple on their pizza no thanks to me
who knew such a small choice could make such a big difference
in our pizza preference
doing whatever tomatoes and sauce just
that icky sweet aftertaste
and just our beloved oven our trusted toaster
and the icky feeling won't go away making

[Pre-Chorus]
and its killed our will to
each elled slice together we
but what would of your never even once
