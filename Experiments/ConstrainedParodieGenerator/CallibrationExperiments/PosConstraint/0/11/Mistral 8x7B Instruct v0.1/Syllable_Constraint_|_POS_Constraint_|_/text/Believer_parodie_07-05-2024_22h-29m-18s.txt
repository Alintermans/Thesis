I'mma put it all politely in its
rightful place with no disturbance
of the status quo dining qu

try to tell me pineapple's divinepaired
with tomato sauce and
its canned ham hideousness upon me
the offense though it tempers me

[Pre-Chorus]
it takes eating without a net
tingling taste buds to forget this
is what passes for an etable
a messy overload my tongue can't abide in
