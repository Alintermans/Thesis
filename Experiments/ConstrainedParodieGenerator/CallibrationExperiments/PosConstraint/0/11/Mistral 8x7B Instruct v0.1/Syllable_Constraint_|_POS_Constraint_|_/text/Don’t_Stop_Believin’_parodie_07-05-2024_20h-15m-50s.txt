[Verse 1]
just a regular cheese slice 'livin'
in a pizza box all on its ownstepping
out of the oven with a topping missionone
topping to add before it's fully grownit

[Verse 2]
no fruit should ever venture there
pineapple doesn't belong there
on this culinary delight
it sets the pizza world alightit

[Pre-Chorus]
wrath surrounding
whole pizzerias downtown
hearts burning with disdain in sight
cheeseologists
sparse toppings only they espouse
zero ounce of pineapple

[Verse 3]
crusts are round for a reason
donuts don't concern us
circle toppings satisfy the soul
not one single

[Verse 4]
no amended ruled no
no adding cooked πs allowed
oh no opinion never
altered is this or that nor that nor

[Pre-Chorus]
wrath surrounding
whole pizzerias downtown
hearts burning with disdain in sight
cheeseologists
sparse toppings only they espouse
zero ounce of pineapple

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
letting alone standing
let the toppings be cons
won't partake
allow πs becoming
ending
pi truly stays
let alone forever
keeping from to a state
x marks exit
