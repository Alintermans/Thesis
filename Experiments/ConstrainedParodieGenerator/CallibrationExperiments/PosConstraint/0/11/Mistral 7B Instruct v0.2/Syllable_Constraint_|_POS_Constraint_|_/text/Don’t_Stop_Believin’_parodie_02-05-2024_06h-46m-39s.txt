[Verse 1]
just a simple meal underneath the moonlight shine
a pepperoni delight or perhaps a
just another argument splitdown the pizza
our toppings clash debating pineapple

[Verse 2]
a diningroom with an oven
the pizzabox between heaven
for a sweetness our palates
its seems like an endless debate on
