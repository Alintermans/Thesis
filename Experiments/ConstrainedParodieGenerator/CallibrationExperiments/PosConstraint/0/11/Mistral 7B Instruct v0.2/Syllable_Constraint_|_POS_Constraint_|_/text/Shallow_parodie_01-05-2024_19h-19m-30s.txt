[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me ladybird
are you happy with that tropical
but supposed herbiv
is pineapple on your pizza still

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I shiver
with each bite due cold my tastebudriver
under
but in a heated spatulation

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
telling me man sir
must you insist on pineapple being
but desired her
can't it be summer without it here

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
we slide der
in these all good time's amended our ire
over
yet in the bad time our faces

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we've forsaken deepside realms dare explore
our will never hit
reach outside a surface just our scoring
our taken now beyond

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pizza placesha
that a foul memoriolaunching past
in the puzzedplacedup
our taking ever on

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh palatal
oh plant milk

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we've forsaken deepside realms dare explore
our will never hit
reach outside a surface just our scoring
our taken now beyond

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the dish divergas
in the dish tastetastytimeon
in the dissonancers
we find where we belongnow
