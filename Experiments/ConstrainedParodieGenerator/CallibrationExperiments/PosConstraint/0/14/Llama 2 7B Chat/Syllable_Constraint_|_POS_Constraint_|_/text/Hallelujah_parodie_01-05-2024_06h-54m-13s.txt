[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should not
be a topping that you would choose to
it's a flavor that just doesn't belong oh no
it's like a choir singing a
discordant hallelujah in
the key of cheese and sauce and pepperoni

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on a pizza is

[Verse 2]
you may think it's exotic and new
but trust me it's just not true oh
it's like a hawaiian vacation on a
pizza that's just not what I do
and don't even get me started
on the texture it's just not right oh no no

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on a pizza is

[Verse 3]
there are toppings that are classic
and then there are some that are just
a pineapple pizza is just not in the
book of pizza toppings oh no no no
it's like a hallelujah in
reverse it's just not the same oh no no no

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on a pizza is

[Verse 4]
you may have your opinions and
your preferences and all that jazz
but when it comes to pineapple on a will
it's like a sin to even think
of putting it on a pizza
it's like a hallelujah no no no no

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on a pizza is
hallelujah hallelujah
no no no no no no no no
hallelujah hallelujah
no no no no no no no no
hallelujah hallelujah
no no no no no no no no
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
hallelujah hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this pizza topping game
I used to love pepperonI and sausage
but now I see the error of my ways
it's a cold and it's a broken
hallelujah no no no no no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time when I thought it
was okay to put pineapple
on a pizza but now I see the light oh
it's not a topping that I would choose
it's a flavor that just doesn't
belong oh no no no no no no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a pizza place
where they put pineapple on the
but this is not the one I choose to grace oh
it's a hallelujah no no no no
no no no no no no no no no
hallelujah hallelujah no no no no
