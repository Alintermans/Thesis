[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the recipes and the
pineapple on a slice
it doesn't belong on
a pizza at all
hercules and his meat
achilles and his feet no pineapple on a pie

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go eatery
how much you want to che
I'm not looking for something sweet
with a topping so neatly
some fairytale treat
just something that's neat
not this tropical delight
please don't put it on
my pizza tonight again

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh no no no no no
oh no no no no
oh no no no no no
oh no no no no no no no
no pineapple on a
pizza please no way
oh no no no no no
no pineapple on a pizza
oh no no no no no no

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the history of food
spaghetti without meat
but pineapple on a
pizza is just not right
superman without his
underoos on tight no pineapple on a

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go eatery
how much you want to che
I'm not looking for something sweet
with a topping so neatly
some fairytale treat
just something that's neat
not this tropical delight
please don't put it on

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh no no no no no no
oh no no no no no no

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh pineapple on a pizza
how could you even think
of putting it on
a pizza without che
it's just not right you know no no
pineapple on a pie
oh no no no no
no no no no no no

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to che
I'm not looking for something sweet
with a topping so neatly
some fairytale treat
just something that's neat
not this tropical delight
please don't put it on
my pizza tonight again

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh no no no no no no no
oh no no no no no no no
no pineapple on a pizza
