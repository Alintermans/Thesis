[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza should not be seen ton

[Verse 1]
fruit on a pie
it just doesn't make any
sense to me and you know why I don't think
it's a crime against culinar
y to put it
where it doesn't belong you know
I mean come on let's be real
it's just not the same as it was before

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
can't believe
people still insist on this
fruit on a pie it's just not right you know
it's like putting ketchup on
a hot dog it
just doesn't make any sense to
me and I know I'm not the
only one who feels this way you know what I

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
pizza is meant to be savory and
sweet is not the way to go you know what I mean it
just leave the fruit for the fruit salad you
know what I'm sayin' it's just not the same as it was

[Outro]
pine
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
