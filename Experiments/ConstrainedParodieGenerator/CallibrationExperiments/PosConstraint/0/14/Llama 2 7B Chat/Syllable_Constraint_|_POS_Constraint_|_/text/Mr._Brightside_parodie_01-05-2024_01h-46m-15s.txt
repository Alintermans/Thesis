[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza should not be the crime of
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
it started out as a topping on a pie and now it
how did it end up in this disgraceful fate and
it was only a pizza topping but now it
now it's ruining the whole dish and my taste bud
and it's all in my head but I can't ignore
the sweetness overpow

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's on top of the che
he takes a bite and it
let me go
'cause I just can't stand it it's killin' me
and takin' control

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza should not be
turnin' pizza into a
sweet and savory mess it
chokin' on a topping that
don't belong on a pie
it's just the price I pay for
destiny is call

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
I'm comin' out of my mind and I've been doin' just fine
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
it started out as a topping on a pie and now it
how did it end up in this disgraceful fate and
it was only a pizza topping but now it
now it's ruining the whole dish and my taste bud
and it's all in my head but I can't ignore
the sweetness overpow

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's on top of the che
he takes a bite and it
let me go
'cause I just can't stand it it's killin
and takin' control

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza should not be
turnin' pizza into a
sweet and savory mess it
chokin' on a topping that
don't belong on a pie
it's just the price I pay for
destiny is call

[Outro]
I never

I never
I never
