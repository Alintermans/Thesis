[Verse 1]
just a pineapple on a pizza town girl liv
she took the midnight train goin' anywhere
just a pizza topping born and raised in hawai
it's a taste sensation goin' anywhere

[Verse 2]
a pineapple in a pizza
smell of sweetness in the air it
for a flavor they can share the
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the pizza joint
their tastebuds searchin' in the
cheesy goodness
livin' just to find a flavor
hidin' somewhere in the to

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get a slice
everybody wants a taste
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more to

[Verse 4]
some will sweat some will sav
some are born to top the pie
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the pizza joint
their tastebuds searchin' in the
cheesy goodness
livin' just to find a flavor
hidin' somewhere in the to

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop savorin
hold on to that flavor
pizza toppings
don't stop savorin
hold on
pizza toppings
don't stop savorin
hold on to that flavor
pizza toppings
