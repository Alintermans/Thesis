don't even get me started
how could they do this to
a sweet and savory sinfulness
I'll never understand
why pineapple on a pizza is
like a joke that never ends well
I'll stick to my pepperoni and
mushrooms and olives too please tell me
why they had to go and ru
my pizza paradise with a
fruit that doesn't belong

[Pre-Chorus]

I'll never worship that way again no more no
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your fork
