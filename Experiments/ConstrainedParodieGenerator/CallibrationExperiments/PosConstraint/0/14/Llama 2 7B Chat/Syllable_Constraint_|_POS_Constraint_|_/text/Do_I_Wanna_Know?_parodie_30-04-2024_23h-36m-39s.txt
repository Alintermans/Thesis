[Verse 1]
have you got a taste for something
that's not on a pizza plate oh no not on a pizza
do you ever get that feeling that you
can't escape the cheesy fate
are there some toppings you dislike so much
that you can't even take a bite oh no not on
a pizza that's got pineapple
on it no no no
how can you do this to me oh pineapple on a pizza
it's like a crime against culinary decree

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this abomination
flows from your mouth to your tummy oh no not on a
pizza that's got pineapple on it no no no
do you want me to gag and throw up oh pineapple

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
origin of the pizza
ever thought of
callin' when you
had a few too
much pineapple on
it's like a sin to put it
on a pizza that
is supposed to be

[Verse 2]
so have you got the balls
to admit that you're wrong oh no not on
a pizza that's got pineapple on it no
do you ever get that feeling that you're wrong oh no not
on a pizza that's got pineapple on it no no no oh
how can you do this to me oh pineapple on a
pizza that's got pineapple on it no no no

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this abomination
flows from your mouth to your tummy oh no not on a
pizza that's got pineapple on it no no no
do you want me to gag and throw up oh pineapple

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the origin of the
pizza that's got pineapple
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few too much pineapple
it's like a sin to put it on a pro
pizza that's supposed to be sav
edible oh no not on
a pizza that's got
pineapple on it

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this abomination
flows from your mouth to your tummy oh no not on a
pizza that's got pineapple on it no no no
do you want me to gag and throw up oh pineapple
on a pizza that's got pineapple on it no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no
