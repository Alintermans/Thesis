[Verse 1]
just stop your whining it's a
sign of the pineapple times
welcome to the final slice of
pizza's ultimate demise accordin' to some
you look tasty on the top
but you ain't really good

[Pre-Chorus]
we never ordered right we've been here
before why are we always arguing
over pineapple on
our pizzas slices torn apart
we never ordered right we've been here be
fore why are we always

[Chorus]
just stop your whining it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
just stop your whining it'll be alright
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here

[Verse 2]
just stop your whining have the taste of your life
breaking through the savory
atmosphere things look pretty
good from here remember everything will
be alright we can meet once
more somewhere far away from

[Pre-Chorus]
we never ordered right we've been here
before why are we always arguing
over pineapple on
our pizzas slices torn apart
we never ordered right we've been here be
fore why are we always

[Chorus]
just stop your whining it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
stop your whining baby it'll be alright
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
we never ordered right we've been here
before why are we always arguing
over pineapple on
our pizzas slices torn apart
we never ordered right we've been here be
fore why are we always

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
we should open up
before it's all too much
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
stop your whining baby it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
