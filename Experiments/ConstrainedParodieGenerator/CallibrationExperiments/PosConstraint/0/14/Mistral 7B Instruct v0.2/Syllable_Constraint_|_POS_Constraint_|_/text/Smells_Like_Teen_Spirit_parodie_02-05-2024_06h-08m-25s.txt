[Verse 1]
load up on pizzas bringing
friends for this culinary thing
pineapple on top is just wronging it
oh no I know a disgusting

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello

[Chorus]
with the lights out it's less tasty here
we are now serving up despair
I feel foolish and contagious
here we are now serving up fear
a pineapple a tomato
a pepper a chili pepper

[Post-Chorus]
yum yum yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I like best
and for this choice I feel blessed
our little pie has always been
and always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello

[Chorus]
with the lights out it's less tasty here
we are now serving up despair
I feel foolish and contagious
here we are now serving up fear
a pineapple a tomato
a pepper a chili pepper

[Post-Chorus]
yum yum yeah

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I taste
oh yeah I guess it makes me shake
I found it hard it's hard to find
oh well whatever let's decline

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello pizza
hello pizzahello

[Chorus]
with the lights out it's less tasty here
we are now serving up despair
I feel foolish and contagious
here we are now serving up fear
a pineapple a tomato
a pepper a chili pepper

[Outro]
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
