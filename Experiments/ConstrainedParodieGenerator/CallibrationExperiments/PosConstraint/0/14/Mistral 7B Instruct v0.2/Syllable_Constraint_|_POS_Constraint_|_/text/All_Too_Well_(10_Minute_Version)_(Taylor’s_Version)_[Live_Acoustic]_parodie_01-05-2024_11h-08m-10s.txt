[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it felt like a mistake
and I left my pizza there with pineapple
and you've still got it in your fridge now looking

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet disposition and my puzzled gaze coll
we're arguing in the kitchen about this
pineapple on a pizza pie falls apart like
and I can picture it after all these nights

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little kitchen
floor you almost choked on your pizza pie because you were laugh
ing at me with pineapple
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter your opinion turning red
you used to be a traditionalist with pepperoni in bed
and your father's telling tales about you on the soccer team
you told me about your past believing pineapple
was the future of pizza but I was skeptical and said
key ingredient on the counter we were deb
ating town and I was thinking on the drive down the
highway any minute now you'd change your mind and say it
's love but all I felt was disag
eement and you held my disappointed gaze
as I reached for the takeout
and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
but all I felt was disappointment and you held me

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light about the merits
of pineapple on a pizza
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like a rule
bound agreement and we
swore to remember it all too well

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you ruined it with
pineapple running scared
I was there I remember it
all too well all too well all too well all too well all
too well all too well all too well all too well all too well all
too well all too well all too well all too well all
too well all too well all too well

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you add pineapple to
my pizza pie I cringe and I'll tell ya why you said if we had been
closer in taste maybe it
would have been fine but that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was I a traditionalist or
a trendsetter with an open mind
not weeping in a party bathroom some
pizza lover cons
oling me what happened you that's what happened
you who charmed my dad with self deprecating jokes
sipping beer like you're on a late night show but then he watched me watch
the oven door all night willing you to remove the pine

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after pepperoni days and nights when you made me
your own now you send back my order and I walk
home alone but you keep my old pizza from that
very first week it reminds you of tradition and
it smells like me you can't
get rid of it cause you remember

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you added pineapple to my pizza
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pizzas stay the same
from when your pepperoni broke my taste
buds and nights when you made me your own now you
mail back my order and I walk home
alone but you keep my old pizza from that first
week it reminds you of nost
algia and it smells like me you can't
get rid of it cause you remebe
r it all too well wind inmy

[Outro]
I love you guys so much just between us I remember
it all too well just between us do you remember
it all too well just between us I remember it all too well
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred agreement we were there we
were there it was rare you remember it all
too well wind in my hair I was there we
were there down the stairs we were there we
were there sacred agreement we were
there it was rare you remember
it all too well wind in my hair I was
there we were there down the stairs we were
there sacred agreement we were there
it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair I was there we were there
down the stairs we were there we were there
sacred agreement we were there it
was rare you remember it all too well wind

[Spoken Outro]
I hate pineapple on
