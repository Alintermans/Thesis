[Verse 1]
twenty years with this endless
struggle to remove that pineapple pester
from our savory
pizza creations I've come to see now
that the kitchen is a battlefield of palate war
for better or for worse

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm standing by the

and so I preheat In the morning and I
step inside the kitchen's warm embrace I take
a deep breath and I get creative
and I protest

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyeyey heyeyeyey hey
I said hey
what's this pineapple doing here
heyeyeyey heyeyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey
what's this pineapple doing here
