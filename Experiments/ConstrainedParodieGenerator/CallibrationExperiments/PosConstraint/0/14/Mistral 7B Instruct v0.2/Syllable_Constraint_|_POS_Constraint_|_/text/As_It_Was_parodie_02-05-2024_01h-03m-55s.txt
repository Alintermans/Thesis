[Intro]
come on folks we wanna say goodbye to you pie

[Verse 1]
topping it off
pineapple's ruining it
I want you to hold out the dish in your hand
why don't we leave it like this
no debate left
when tradition gets in the way
it seems authenticity
can't replace the classic taste I'll stay

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple lovers answer
why are you defending this trend on the
floor of the kitchen standin
ringing the bell
and the purists are coming to
save the day from this blunder
your grandma just wants her peace of mind now oh

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home try new dishes fast internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave tradition two foodies follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's ordering it

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was not the same as
as it was as it was
