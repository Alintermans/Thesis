[Intro]
is it right they put pineapple on a

[Verse 1]
once the cheese had melted dim
but pineapple on the pizza
just doesn't seem to jive in
it's not a perfect

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand slices later we see
your toppings and your choice so carelessly laid out before me
you crave my pepperoni before it called you a foolish
eater searching for a taste sensation superiority

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they placed that ring of fruit on
was it wrong when they scattered ham and bacon
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now then now

[Post-Chorus]
is it right is it right

[Verse 2]
when you lost control of your
palate red sauce white cheese
green pineapple on a plate
your new dish is my peace

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
there were debates and
at least I had the decency
to keep my opinions out
only rumors about my love for
traditional ways
oh pineapple on a pizza
I think about arguing
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand pizza parties later oh
if it's got pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably order it
you crave my pepperoni before it called you a foolish e
ater searching for a taste sensation superiority

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they placed that ring of fruit on
was it wrong when they scattered ham and bacon
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now then now

[Post-Chorus]
is it
right is it right is it
right is
it right is it

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
there were debates and
at least I had the decency
to keep my opinions out
only rumors about my love for
traditional ways
oh pineapple on a pizza
I think about arguing
just to see you come running towards
me and say the one thing I've been wanting but

[Outro]
debating debating
debating debating debating debating debating
let's fast forward to a thousand pizza
parties later oh I was
hoping you'd be there and
say the
one thing I've been wanting but no no no no no
