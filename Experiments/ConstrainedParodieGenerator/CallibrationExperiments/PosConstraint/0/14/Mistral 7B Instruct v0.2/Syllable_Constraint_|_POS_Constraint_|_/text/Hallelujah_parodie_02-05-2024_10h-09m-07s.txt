[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that italians made and it caused a
disagreeable surprise for ya it goes like
this pineapple first then tom sauce
the slippery slide of flavor
the sweet and savory clash of pineapple

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 2]
your taste was strong but you demanded
proof no ham or pepper on your
pizza pie but then she added pineapple
she twisted up your pizza slice
she ruined all your favorite to
pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 3]
you say I added pineapple
I don't even know the name
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a flavor explosion in each bite
it doesn't matter which you sight
the classic or the tropical pineapple

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I tried to touch
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of taste
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Outro]
hallelujah pineapple pie

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this table I've sat at
before I knew you and your pineapple pie
and I've seen your flag on the pepper pot
love is not a victory dish
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy pepper was moving
and every bite we took was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to argue with someone who outdrew
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
