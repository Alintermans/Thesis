[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
pepperoni and its
pineapple's
topping's defiance we
but I'm not the kind of eater that it appeals to

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said pitas or deep dish
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pie with
some strange toppings that persist
some exotic fruit
some unusual
just something I can turn to
somebody I can miss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
dooboo boo dooboo do
dooboo boo dooboo
dooboo boo dooboo do
oh I want something just like this
dooboo boo dooboo do
dooboo boo dooboo
dooboo boo dooboo do
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on a pie
pepperoni and its
pineapple's defiance
but I'm not the kind of
eater that it appeals to she said pitas

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
or deep dish how much you wanna
risk I'm not looking for
a pie with some strange toppings that
persist some exotic fruit
some unusual
just something I can
turn to somebody I can
miss I want something just

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
like this dooboo boo dooboo
do dooboo dooboo dooboo

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
dooboo boo dooboo do
dooboo boo dooboo
dooboo boo dooboo do
oh I want something just like this
dooboo boo dooboo do
dooboo boo dooboo
dooboo boo dooboo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pie with
some strange toppings that persist
some exotic fruit
some unusual
just something I can turn to
somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
