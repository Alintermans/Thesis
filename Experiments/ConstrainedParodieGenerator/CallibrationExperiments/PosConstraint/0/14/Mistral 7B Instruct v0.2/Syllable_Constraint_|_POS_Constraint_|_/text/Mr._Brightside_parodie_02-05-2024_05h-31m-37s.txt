[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta hide from the sun because I hate pineap
it started out on a pie then something went amisses
it was only a pie it was only a pie
now I'm watchin' it bake and they're orderin' a
pizza with that fruit that I can't abide a
now they're savourin' their feast and my appetite
is in a permanent

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're twirling their slices
they're savouring their slic
let me go
I just can't partake it's driving me
crazy and takin

[Chorus]
pineappleness turning food into the
seafood aisles swimming through sick
pizza toppings chokin' on
your pepperonis but it
's just the price I payeasy come
open up my closed eyesease
'cause I'm mr hindsight

[Guitar Solo]
