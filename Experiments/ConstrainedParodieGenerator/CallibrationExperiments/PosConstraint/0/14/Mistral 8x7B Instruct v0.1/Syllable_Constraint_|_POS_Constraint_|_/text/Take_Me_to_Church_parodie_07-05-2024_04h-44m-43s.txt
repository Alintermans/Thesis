[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go ical error
pineapple should not be there no sir
I should have added pepperron
if the heavens ever did dec
ree a pizza topping
a savory slice they'd be recomm
ending not this sweet ab
omination we see here today
my pizza has no absolut
e taste with pineapple in the way
I was born hungry but I hate it
demanding I remove that
topping that should never have been
created for a pie

[Pre-Chorus]
a mercy
mercy mercy

[Chorus]
take me to a
better pizza place instead of this fraudulent
one that thinks pineapple is acceptable or
even desirable on
a pizza pie let me give you a
life without this
sweet monstrosity taking away the joy of
taste offer me a pizza worth eating and not
spitting out in disgust take
me to a pizza place that knows what

[Verse 2]
if I'm a fan of the real deal food
my pizza should be sav
ory and satisfying not
a mockery of something
that should be delicious not absurd
something with dignity and taste
not a disgrace to the name
of pizza what's the point of
a topping that ruins the whole
experience of eating a
slice of heaven on

[Chorus]
take me to a
better pizza place instead of this fraudulent
one that thinks pineapple is acceptable or
even desirable on
a pizza pie let me give you a
life without this
sweet monstrosity taking away the joy of
taste offer me a pizza worth eating and not
spitting out in disgust take
me to a pizza place that knows what

[Bridge]
no compromises or settling for less when
it comes to food we should never settle for anything
less than the best ingredients and flavors in
the search for the perfect pizza only then we can

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh mercy
mercy mercy

[Chorus]
take me to a
better pizza place instead of this fraudulent
one that thinks pineapple is acceptable or
even desirable on
a pizza pie let me give you a
life without this
sweet monstrosity taking away the joy of
taste offer me a pizza worth eating and not
spitting out in disgust take
me to a pizza place that knows what
