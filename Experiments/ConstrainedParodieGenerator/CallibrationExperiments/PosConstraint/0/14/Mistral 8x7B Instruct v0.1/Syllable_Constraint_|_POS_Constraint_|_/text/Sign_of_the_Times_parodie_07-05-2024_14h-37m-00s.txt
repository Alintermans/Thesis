[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a culinary crime
don't you think it's gross inside
it's a topping that just doesn't belong here with
the cheese and pepperoni
it's just not meant to be sir

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before with pineapple
why does it keep appearing on our
pizzas and our night
mares we've been here before with pineap
please leave it far away from our plates
tonight and every

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
put down that pineapple slice and set us
free they said the pizza police
will take it all away from us

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a disastrous pairing
with the marinara sauce
remember how we vowed to never let
it happen again somewhere
far away from pizza night

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before with pineapple
why does it keep appearing on our
pizzas and our night
mares we've been here before with pineap
please leave it far away from our plates
tonight and every

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
stop your crying baby it'll be alright
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from this

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before with pineapple
why does it keep appearing on our
pizzas and our night
mares we've been here before with pineap
please leave it far away from our plates
tonight and every

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
we should open up
before it's all too much
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my plea no
more we gotta get rid
of it we got to get rid of it away from
our pizza we got to get rid of it now
we got to get rid of it now
we got to get rid of it now
we got to get rid of it now
