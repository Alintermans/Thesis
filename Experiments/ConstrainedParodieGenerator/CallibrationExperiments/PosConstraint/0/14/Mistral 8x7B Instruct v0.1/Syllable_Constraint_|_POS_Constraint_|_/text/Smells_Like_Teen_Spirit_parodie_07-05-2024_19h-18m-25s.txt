[Verse 1]
grab some dough, and call
your friends to bake a call to arms
against the trend that's gone too far itting
on a pizza is just not smart

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the heat off it's less disgusting
here we stand against this abom
I feel sick at the very thought
here we stand against this abom
a pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against libido

[Post-Chorus]
yuck yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I try to fight it but it
persists despite my protest
our group remains unshaken still
against this trend until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the heat off it's less disgusting
here we stand against this abom
I feel sick at the very thought
here we stand against this abom
a pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against libido

[Post-Chorus]
yuck yeah yeah

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I care
the taste is just not worth it all
I tried it once but now I find
it's just not worth the fallout from

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the heat off it's less disgusting
here we stand against this abom
I feel sick at the very thought
here we stand against this abom
a pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against libido

[Outro]
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial
