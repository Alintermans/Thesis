[Intro]
I think I've had my fill now of that
pineapple on pizza trending
I've tried to ignore it and move on
but I can't pretend to
like it now

[Verse]
I've tasted two disasters on
crusts now sweet and savory found such a strange pairing it
makes me cringe at the thought of it all
if I could turn back time and stop it before
it began would I do it all
again and again I'd say no way to pineapple on
my pizza slice it just does not belong
I've tasted two disasters on crusts now sweet and savory
I've tried to ignore it and move
on but I can't pretend to like it now in my grave
I'll rot before I let pineapple
on my pizza again and again I'd say
no way to pineapple onmy
pizza slice it just does not belong repeated for fun
in my grave I'll rot before I let pine
apple on my pizza again and again I'd say no way

[Chorus]
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rototot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rototot
in my grave I'll rot

[Outro]
in my grave I'll rot
I'll rot I'll rot I'll rot
is my pain your pleasure
is all of my pain your pleasure
enjoy
