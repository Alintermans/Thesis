[Verse 1]
just a small town slice' no pineapple allowed
in a lonely pie shop everyone's so proud
just a cheesy dish born and raised in italy
it took the midnight train going anywhere

[Verse 2]
a pizza in a wood fire
tomato sauce and mozzareire
for a taste they can savor the
night goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
people waiting
on the streets so wide awake
their hunger searching in the night
pizza ovens
cooking pies to make it right oh
the dish never ends it goes

[Verse 3]
working hard to get a slice
everyone wants a taste so
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will win some will lose
some are born to sing the blues
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
people waiting
on the streets so wide awake
their hunger searching in the night
pizza ovens
cooking pies to make it right oh
the dish never ends it goes

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't add pineapple
hold on to that pizza
pizza ovens
don't add pineapple
hold on
pizza ovens
don't add pineapple
hold on to that pizza
pizza ovens
