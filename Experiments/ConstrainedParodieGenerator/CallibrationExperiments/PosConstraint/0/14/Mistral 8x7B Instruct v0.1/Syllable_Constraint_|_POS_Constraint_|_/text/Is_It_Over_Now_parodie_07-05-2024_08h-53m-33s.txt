[Intro]
pineapple on pizza pie oh say is

[Verse 1]
once the box was opened wide
cheese and sauce mixed with pineapple
taste and flavor took a dive
your hunger still not

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later I see
your plate with chunks of pineapple on display for all to see
you dream of savory flavors but they're not to be baby
you search for something better but it's just a fantasy baby

[Chorus]
was it over when you took your first bite oh
was it over when you realized it was a
mistake to put pineapple on
your pizza oh no it was not it
is not over now it lingers on your taste

[Post-Chorus]
pineapple on pizza

[Verse 2]
when you lost your appetite
red sauce and pineapple
green olives on a pizza
it just doesn't belong

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the pineapple chunks
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza without
only rumors of pineapple chunks
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred awkward pizza parties where
pineapple is served and I despair oh no I can't be there oh no
you dream of savory flavors but they're not to be baby you
search for something better but it's just a fantasy baby oh

[Chorus]
was it over when you took your first bite oh
was it over when you realized it was a
mistake to put pineapple on
your pizza oh no it was not it
is not over now it lingers on your taste

[Post-Chorus]
pineap
le on pizza oh say
is it
over now oh

[Bridge]
oh lord I think about
jumping off of tall
buildings just to see you come run
ning and say the one thing I
ve been wanting but no oh no oh
no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no oh
no oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no oh no oh
no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no

[Outro]
pineapple on pizza
oh say is it over now oh no it is not over now
pineapple on pizza oh say is it
over now oh no it is
not over now oh no
it is
not over now oh no it is not over now
