[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple a treat
on your pizza pie despite its taste being quite unique
do you ever question if it's a feat
that it's even there upon that
juicy meaty dish you can't resist
it's like a tickle in your throat you can't dismiss
how many bites can you resist
'cause there's this truth I found
that makes me think of pineapple's wrongness somehow and I can
taste the disgust on repeat until I've had a

[Pre-Chorus]
should I give it a chance again and try it out
do I really want it in my life without a doubt
baby we both know that the pizza was made right
for savory flavors and not a sweet surprise in

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to pine
ever thought of adding it
when you dine out
I never do
maybe I'm too
busy hating it
to enjoy my meal without
now I've thought it through
crawlin' back to pine

[Verse 2]
so do you have the nerve
to put pineapple on your slice again
or will you finally observe how much it
interrupts the harmony of cheese and sauce and herbs and
simmer down and taste the difference it makes when it's not there
and if you feel the same as I do we could enjoy
our pizza without the shame of pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
should I give it a chance again and try it out
do I really want it in my life without a doubt
baby we both know that the pizza was made right
for savory flavors and not a sweet surprise in

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to pineapple pie again
ever thought of tasting it
when you're dining in or out
I never do because I always
know it's too much of a distraction from
the joy of pizza without the
fruity addition that ru
ins my mealtime fun
crawlin' back to pine

[Outro]
should I give it a chance again and try it out
do I really want it in my life without a doubt
baby we both know that the pizza was made right
for savory flavors and not a sweet surprise in
should I try it again or stick to what I know is
right for my pizza cravings without the pineapple
do you want me crawling back to pineapple pie again
