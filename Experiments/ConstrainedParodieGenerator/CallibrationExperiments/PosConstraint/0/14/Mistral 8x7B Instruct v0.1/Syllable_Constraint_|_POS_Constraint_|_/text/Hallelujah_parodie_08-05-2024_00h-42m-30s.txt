[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for that do ya pov
it goes like this the dough the sauce
the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the baffling sight of pineapple shows

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 2]
your taste was fine but you needed proof
you tried it once and it ruined
your appetite with its sweet rebuffin' ya
it tasted wrong it tasted odd
it tasted like it didn't belong
and from your mouth you spit the pineapple no

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 3]
you say it's just a trendy phase
this pineapple on pizza days
but if you tried it well really what's it to
ya there's a mix of taste that clashes so
it doesn't matter which you chose
the bitter or the sweet pineapple nope no

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 4]
I gave it try it wasn't much
I wanted to like it but I couldn
t feel it so I tried to touch it still it
wasn't right and even though it
all went wrong I'll stand before the
pizza gods with nothing on my plate but pine

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Outro]
pineapple no no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I've tried it sore
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your kind on the pizza store
love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken pineapple no

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy pepperoni was
moving too but now it's just pineapple nope no

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a taste above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to spit at something that outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken pineapple no
