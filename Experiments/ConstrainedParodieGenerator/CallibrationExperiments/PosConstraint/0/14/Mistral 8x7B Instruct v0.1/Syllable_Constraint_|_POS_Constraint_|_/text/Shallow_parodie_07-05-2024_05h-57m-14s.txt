[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something's wrong
why would pineapple belong on a
pizza treat fit for
a carnivore's feast or so it

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
it's appall
in the good times I find myself longing for
a slice
in the bad times I fear myself full

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something man
aren't you tired of this ham on a
pizza plan or is
it just too bland for you to stand alone

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
it's a fail
in the good times I find myself longing for
a taste
in the bad times I fear myself full

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching as I dive
in the trash can tonight
crash through the surface where it can't survive
we're far from the savory

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the no way jose yeah
in the no way jose yeah today
in the no way jose yeah
we're far from the savory

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh no no no
oh no no

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching as I dive
in the trash can tonight
crash through the surface where it can't survive
we're far from the savory

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the no way jose
in the no way jose yeah today
in the no way jose
we're far from the savory
