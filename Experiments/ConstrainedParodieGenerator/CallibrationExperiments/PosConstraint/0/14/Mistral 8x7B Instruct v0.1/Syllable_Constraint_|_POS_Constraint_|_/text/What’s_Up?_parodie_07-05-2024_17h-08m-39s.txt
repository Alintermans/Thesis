[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I realized quickly when I took a bite
that pineapple's a culprit that just doesn't fit right
it's time to set things straight

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I see it on the
pizza that I'm going to devour
and I think to myself as I take a shower
what's the meaning of this abomination power
and I say to myself as I take a bite
what's the reason for this endless fight
and I scream from

[Chorus]
the top of my lungs with
vexation
hey pineapple off my pizza
and I say to myself
as I take
another bite of my pizza

[Bridge]
oh no
oh
oh no way
oh no
oh
oh no way

[Verse 2]
and I tried
my best to enjoy it
but I failed each time
in this culinary
and I pray
to the gods of pizza
please let this trend decline oh so
fastly nowadays

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I see it on the
pizza that I'm going to devour
and I think to myself as I take a shower
what's the meaning of this abomination power
and I say to myself as I take a bite
what's the reason for this endless fight
and I scream from

[Chorus]
the top of my lungs with
vexation
hey pineapple off my pizza
and I say to myself
as I take
another bite of my pizza
and I say to myself
as I take a bite of my pizza
and I say
hey pineapple off my pizza now
and I say
hey pineapple off my pizza
and I say to myself
as I take a bite of my pizza
and I say hey hey
hey pineapple off my pizza now
and I say
hey pineapple off my pizza

[Bridge]
oh no
oh
oh no way

[Outro]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate yeah
