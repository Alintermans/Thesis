[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottles in hand looking so divine start
it started out with a slice now my stomach is in a
wad of regret and disappointment in my heart
now I'm tossing in my bed while they indulge and
savor every bite and my stomach starts to
churn and it's all in my head and I can't take
part in this culprit act

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savoring the taste
while pineapple's on the
plate let me
go and I can't bear to see it on
my pizza any

[Chorus]
jealousy boiling over like a pot
pineapple's not a worthy
topping and I'm not gonna
eat it ever again it
just doesn't belong on a
pizza no matter what they
say I'm mr bright

[Guitar Solo]
