[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I'm disgusted then
wish I could explain it clearer
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a protest letter
to tell the world to steer clear
do you read my rants online
or do you skip my line of sight
when you said you'd give it a chance
were you even on my side
I knew when I asked you to try it once you would
say it's fine but never mean it through and
I'd end up with a ruined feast instead of true delightful foodie
don't say it's just a phase
you clearly weren't aware
that you made me lose my faith in pizza forever
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I'm disgusted
wish I could explain it clearer I wish it wasn't
true mmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmh
mmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmmhmm

[Verse 2]
you call me again defending pine
drivin' home under the influence
you said it's just an experimenting phase
I don't relate to you I don't
relate to you no cause I
would never treat my pizza this
way you made me hate my go to
food forever and ever

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about pizza online never
told anyone anything bad cause that
shit's embarrassing you were my everything and
all that you did was make me question my life
choices so don't waste the time I don
t have and don't try to make me
feel bad I could talk about every time that you showed up
on time but I'd have an empty line cause you never
paid any mind to my taste preference so I shut them
all out for you cause I was a kid but now

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone yeah fuck you
ah
goddam
ah
fuck you
fuck you
