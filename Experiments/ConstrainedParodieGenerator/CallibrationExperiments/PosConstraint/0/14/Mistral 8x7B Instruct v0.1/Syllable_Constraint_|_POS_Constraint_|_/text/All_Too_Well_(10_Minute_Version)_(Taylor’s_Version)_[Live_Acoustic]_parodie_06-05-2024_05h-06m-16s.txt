[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my appetite at the table
that monstrosity should not be allowed now

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet deception and my misguided taste bud
we're arguing in the kitchen like two fool
hammered by the taste of pineapple chunks in the
pizza sauce congealing like a cruel rule

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's a mistake
but I'm still reaching for a
slice of pizza that's not meant to be mine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that slice of pizza
an affront to all that is good and true and tasty in life
sauce and cheese and dough and love
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
canned pineapple on the countertop staring back at me
you used to be a good pie with pepperoni and cheese in sightsee
but now you're tainted by the sickly sweetness of pineapple
and I can't believe I ever thought it was a
good idea to put it there at all oh no no no no
check the taste and come back swearing it's
the same but it's not it's a crime against pizza and
I can't believe I ever thought it was okay to
put pineapple on a pizza
I can't believe I ever thought it was
a good idea to put
pineapple on a pizza no no no no no no no
I can't believe I ever thought it was okay

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's a mistake
but I'm still reaching for a slice
of pizza that's not meant to be mine at
all oh oh oh no no no no

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that slice of pizza pie
an affront to all that is good and true and tasty in life
sauce and cheese and dough and
love I remember it all too
well and I can't believe I ever thought it was
a good idea to put pineapple on a pizza
I can't believe it
I can't believe I ever thought

[Bridge]
well maybe we got carried away with
toppings but this is just too
far and I can't believe I ever
thought it was a good
idea to put pine
apple on a pizza no no
I can't believe it I remember it all too well and
you call me up again just to remind me of my mistake
so casually cruel in the name of a
topping that should never have been

[Verse 4]
I used to love pizza in all its forms and shapes and
sizes but now I'm hesitant to take
a bite for fear of finding pineapple on top of it all oh no
I can't believe I let
you talk me into trying it I should have
known better than to trust your taste in food oh no no no no no no no
I can't believe I let you talk
me into trying it I can't trust
your taste in food no
I can't believe I let you talk meinto
trying it I can't trust your taste in food no
I can't believe I let you talk me into trying it no
I can't trust your taste in food no no no no no no

[Verse 5]
time won't change the fact that I hate pineapple
on pizza it's a travesty that should never have been allowed now
after years of enjoying pizza in all its forms
I'm stuck with this memory of pineapple chunks
and I can't get rid of it I remember
it all too well and I can't believe I ever
thought it was a good ideea
I can't believe I ever thought

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again on that slice of pine
apple pizza an affront to all that is good and
true and tasty in life
sauce and cheese and dough and lovei
remember it all too well
and I can't believe
I ever thought it was
a good idea to
put pineapple on a
pizza I can't believe it

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at hiding my disdain for pineap
ple on pizza but the taste of it lingers
in my mouth like a bad dream that I can
never forget I remember it all too
well and I can't believe I let
you talk me into trying it I should have known
better than to trust your taste
in food I remember it all too well
and I can't believe I let
you talk me into trying it

[Outro]
I can't believe it I remember it all too well
pineapple on a pizza I can't believe it
I can't believe I ever thought it was a good idea
I can't believe it I remember
it all too well I can't believe
it I can't believe it I can
't believe it I can't believe it I can
't believe It I can't believe It I
can't believe it I can't trust
your taste in food I can't believe
it I can't believe it it
was a mistake I can't believe it
I can't believe it I can't
believe it I can't believe it
I can't believe it I can
't believe it I can't believe it was
a mistake I can't believe it
I can't believe it I can't
believe it I can't believe it I can

[Spoken Outro]
