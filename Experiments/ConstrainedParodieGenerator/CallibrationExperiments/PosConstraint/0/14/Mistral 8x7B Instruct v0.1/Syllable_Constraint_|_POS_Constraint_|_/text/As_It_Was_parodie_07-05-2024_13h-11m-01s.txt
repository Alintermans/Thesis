[Intro]
come on now folks let's share our two cents on this

[Verse 1]
firmly in place
sweet cheesy goodness takes its
grace as I look at the slice in my hand say
why add fruit to this dish today
taste is bland when
ham and pineapple blend in a
messy panoply of flav
ors that just don't belong this way done

[Chorus]
in this pie it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this pie it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
call the chef tell
him to stick with the classics
don't mess with perfection that's tried and
true like a pizza should be
ring the alarm
when you see pineapple added
it's time to abandon that
tragedy before it reaches me done in

[Chorus]
in this pie it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this pie it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
bake it right don't adulterate the
crust with fruit that's not meant to be part of it true blue
serve it up with pepperoni or sa
usage but pineapple's got nothing to do with it

[Outro]
hey
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
