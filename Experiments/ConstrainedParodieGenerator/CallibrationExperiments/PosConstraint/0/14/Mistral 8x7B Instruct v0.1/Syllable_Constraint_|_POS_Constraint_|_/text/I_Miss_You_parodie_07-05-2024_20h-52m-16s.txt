[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on pizza's scandalized cul
inary scandalizing our taste
buds' sensibilities they
must be eradicated
let's discard this monstrosity and instead
opt for classic pepper'ni
in the night we'll savor flavors right
we'll savor flavors right amonst the moon
we'll savor flavors right

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the ham and mushrooms hiding
I cannot bear this sweet and savory
combination of disgusting
an abomina
tion caught within this pie's interiority
and as I stare I ponder
the audacity of this
creation ruining every
bite I take and making me rec
oil in pure disgust tonight
disgust tonight oh what a fright tonight
stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're just
ruining every
bite inside my head don
't waste your time on pineapple you're just ruini
ng every bite with
your presence here tonight

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're just
ruining every
bite inside my head don
't waste your time on pineapple you're just ruini
ng every bite with
your presence here tonight
don't waste your time on pineapple you're just
ruining every
bite inside my head don
't waste your time on pineapple you're just ruini
ng every bite with
your presence here tonight

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
