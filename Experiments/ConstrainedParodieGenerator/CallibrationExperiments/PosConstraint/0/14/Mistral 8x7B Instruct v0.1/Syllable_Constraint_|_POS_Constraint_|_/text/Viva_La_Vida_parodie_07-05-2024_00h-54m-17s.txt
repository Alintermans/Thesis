[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice foot
now in the morning I take a bite
of a pizza that just ain

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to love the taste
but now it's ruined by the pineap
stuck in every bite like
a thorn in my side I can't escape
one bite in and I feel bet
the sweetness turned to regret
and I discovered that my crust is soft
upon a base of bad decisions aloft

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
pineapple lovers singing their song
be my savory topping and
my cheese that's perfectly strung along a
crust that's never had a chance to shine
for some reason pineapple
ruins every bite
and that was when I loved pizza

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a tropical and wrong
choice of toppings all along blown
shattered flavor and the sound of che
people couldn't believe what I'd condone
revolutionaries wait
for my apology in has
te no king would ever choose pineapple on
a pizza slice they'd rather pass on

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
pineapple lovers singing their song
be my savory topping and
my cheese that's perfectly strung along a
crust that's never had a chance to shine
for some reason pineapple ruins e
very bite and that was
when I loved pizza icing on

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no
oh no oh no oh no

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
hear the bells of disappointment ring
pineapple lovers hum
be my savory topping and the
cheese that's perfectly stretched
a crust that's never had a chance
for some reason pineap
ple ruins every bite and that was
when I loved pizza iced
with pineapple slices icing on
topped with pineapple slic
es icing on top of pizza icing
on a pizza slice iced
with pineapple slices icing
