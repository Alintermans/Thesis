[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies now are falling like the rain so
let the river run juice

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his slice in hand met with
disgust and a glare oh god what
is that on your pizza man they stare
in disbelief as he takes a bite and dares them
to challenge his choice of pineapple paired with ham
on a pizza ain't no one gonna
change his mind it's a sin but he don't give a damn he
doesn't care what they think he's a fan of the sweet and tangy combo
on his pizza and he's not
alone there's a whole cult following of pineapple on
pizza lovers and they're not afraid to show it
but to the purists it's an outrage a travesty a
disgrace to the art of pizza
making but he just laughs and takes another bite and
says they don't know what they're missing so let the river run juice
juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice
juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
truth and my lies now are falling like the rain so
let the river run juice

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand it
was just for fun but now she's come undone she can
no longer stand the sight of pineapple on
her pizza it's a deal breaker a game chang
er but he just laughs and says it's just a pizza to
pping but to her it's a symbol of everything that
was wrong with their relationship he never took her needs
into account he just did what he wanted without a second thought so
he tries to make it right but it's too late she's already gone and he
knows he's lost a good one but he just can
't help himself when it comes to pineapple on pizza
so he keeps on eating it and hoping that one day she'll come
back and understand but until then he'll just
let the river run juice juice juice juice juice
juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice
juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice
juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice
juice juice juice juice juice juice
juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice
juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine

all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something

let the river run juice

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]

run juice juice juice juice juice juice juice juice

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the joker never the hero
never the one to say no to pine on
my pizza but now I'm starting to see the error of
my ways it's not just a pizza topping it's a
symbol of disrespect to the pizza
making community and
to all those who hold it dear I never
thought about it that way but now I see the light
and I'm sorry to all those I've offended
with my flippant attitude towards
pizza toppings but most of all I'm sorry
to her the one who got away because of

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
's gonna cause is pain truth andmy
lies now are falling like the rain so let the juice
run juice juice juice juice juice
