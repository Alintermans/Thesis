[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up and declare

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my eager taste buds gazing
at the menu up on the wall with stars in
our eyes autumn leaves falling down like choices
to be made and I can picture it all now

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that flavor's not here no more
and I might be okay but my taste buds are not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost chose the wrong topping because you were looking at
me pineapple on pizza
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza on the counter your face was red
you used to be a little kid with a big appetite in your head
and your mother's telling stories bout you and your favorite
topping anchovies you told me bout your past thinking
your future was me and you were tossing me the slice keys fat
chain on the ground we were always skipping town and
I was thinking on the drive down any time now he
s gonna say it s love you never called it what it
was til we were dead and gone and
buried check the pulse and come back swearing it
s the same after three months
in the grave and then you wondered where It went to as I
reached for you but all I felt was shame and you held me

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it s long gone
and there was nothing else I could
do and I forget about you long en
ough to forget why I needed

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we re dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerate
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an
oath sacred prayer and we
d swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I m a crumpled up piece of paper
lying here cause I remember

[Verse 4]
they say all s well that ends well but I m in a
new hell every time you double cross
my mind you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have
been fine and that made me want
to die the idea you had of me who
was she a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on
you not weeping in a party bath
room some actress asking me what happened
you that s what ha
ppened you you who charmed my dad with self eff
acing jokes sipping coffee like you re on a
late night show but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing
you to come and he said it s supposed to be fun turn

[Verse 5]
time won t fly it s like I m paralyz
ed by it I d like to be my old self again but I m still
trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when
you made me your own now you mail back my things and
I walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from
that very first week cause it reminds you of innoc
ence and it smells like me you
can t get rid of it cause you re

[Chorus]
member it all too well yeah cause there we
are again when I loved you so back before you lost
the one real thing you ve
ever known it was rare I was
there I remember it all
too well wind in my hair
you were there you remem
ber it all oh oh oh

I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I ll get older but your lovers staymy
age from when your brooklyn broke my skin and
bones I m a soldier who s returning
half her weight and did the twin flame bru
ise paint you blue just between us did the love af
fair maim you too cause in this
city s barren cold I still re mem
