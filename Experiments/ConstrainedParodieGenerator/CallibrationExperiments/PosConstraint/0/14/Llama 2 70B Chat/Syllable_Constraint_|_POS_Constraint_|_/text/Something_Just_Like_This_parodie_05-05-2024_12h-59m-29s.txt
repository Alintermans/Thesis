[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for
a long time now it's true
but there's one topping that
I just can't get through
it's the pineapple
it's just not right ia
it doesn't belong on a pie ia ia iah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go I
don't know how much more
I can take of this pineapple
it's just not what I adore
I'm not looking for
a fruit that's so sweet
I need something more savour
something that's truly neat
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just
like this oh I want
something just like this oh
I want something just like this iah
iah ia ia iah
iah ia ia
iah ia ia iah
iah ia ia ia iah
iah ia ia ia

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
of old and new ia
the legends and the truth
the dos and don'ts ia
but pineapple on a
pizza it's just not right
it's like putting jam on a iah ia iah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go iah
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for a fruit iah
that's so out of place ia
I'm not looking for
a taste that's so strange
I need something more classic
something that's truly grand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just iah
like this oh I want iah iah

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just iah iah
like this oh I want iah
iah ia ia
iah ia ia iah
iah ia ia iah ia
iah ia ia iah
iah ia ia
iah ia ia iah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for a fruit iah
that's so out of place ia
I'm not looking for
a taste that's so strange
I need something more classic
something that's truly grand
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just iah iah
like this oh I want iah iah iah
oh I want something just iah iah
