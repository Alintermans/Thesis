[Verse 1]
just stop your whining it's a crime against the
pizza that you're trying to
deface with your pineapple on
top it's a sin and a shameful act no need to
fret the pizza's perfect just
the way it is don't you

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we've had pizza for
years why do you think you can improve it
with your tropical fruit
we've been here before don't you know
the toppings are fine just the way they are
no need to be a re

[Chorus]
just stop your crying it's a sign of the times
pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza it's just not right it
ruins the flavor and the vibe it's time
to stop the madness and just stick
to the classics we gotta keep

[Verse 2]
just stop your crying have some self control your
pineapple cravings need to
stop take a bite of pepper
oni instead it's delicious and it
won't make the pizza taste
awful don't you know that

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we've had pizza for
years why do you think you can improve it
with your tropical fruit
we've been here before don't you know
the toppings are fine just the way they are
no need to be a re

[Chorus]
we never learn we've been here before why do
you insist on trying to change
what's not broken just enjoy the
pizza as it is don't be so strange stop
your crying baby it's a sign
of the times we gotta get back

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we've had pizza for
years why do you think you can improve it
with your tropical fruit
we've been here before don't you know
the toppings are fine just the way they are
no need to be a re

[Bridge]
to the basics we need
to remember what
makes a pizza great don
't add something that will
ruin the taste we
should open up to

[Outro]
the possibilities but not with pineapple
on top we gotta get
back to the classics we gotta get away from
your strange toppings we gotta get away we got
to get away we got to get
away we got to get away
we got to get away please don
