[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain it clear
it doesn't belong there

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to collect my thought before I
start to rant about this ab
horrent topping that they dare
to call a pizza topping
do you read the menu or do
you just wing it and hope for the
best when it comes to toppings
because when you said you were hungry I assumed
you meant for real food not some gimmick with
a fruit that doesn't belong on a pie you said you knew what I was
telling you but clearly you
didn't listen to a word
and now I'm left with a stomach ache and a bad taste

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain it clear it doesn't bel

[Verse 2]
you call me a hater or a pur

topping is a travesty and I won't
stand for it I don't relate to you
or your love for pineapple
on pizza I don't want to
hear your justifications or
excuses pineapple on

[Verse 3]
pizza is a sin and I won't back down from this fight
I don't talk shit about pineapple
on the internet but I'll say it to your face
it's a disgrace to the culinary world
and all that you do is defend it like
it's your child or something so don't
waste my time with your weak arguments and don't try to make
me feel bad for my stance I could list all the reasons
why pineapple doesn't belong but it's pointless because
you won't ever understand so just leave

[Outro]
me and my taste buds alone
you ruined pizza for me always
said it was just a topping
but it's a travesty just leave me be
ye
ah ah
god
damn it
just leave
