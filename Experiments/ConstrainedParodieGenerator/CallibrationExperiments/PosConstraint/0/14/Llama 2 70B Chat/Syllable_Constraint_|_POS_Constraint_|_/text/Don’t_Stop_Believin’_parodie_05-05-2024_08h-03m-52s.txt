[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie sitin' in the oven ton
a topping so wrong it's like a crime scene gone
pineapple on a pizza is a sinful sight
it don't belong there it's a culinar

[Verse 2]
a flavor so sweet it's like a
poisonous treat it don't fit
with the savory taste of the
cheese and the sauce it's just a waste or

[Pre-Chorus]
customers wait
for a pie that's great honest
their taste buds searchin' for a treat
pizza lovers
livin' just to eat emotion
hidin' somewhere in the che

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to make a pie
that's perfectly fine no need
to add some fruit and ruin the taste
just stick with what

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
hate it some are born to cook
the pizza never ends it
goes on and on and on and on or

[Pre-Chorus]
customers wait
for a pie that's great honest
their taste buds searchin' for a treat
pizza lovers
livin' just to eat emotion
hidin' somewhere in the che

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin
hold on to that feelin
pizza lovers
don't stop believin
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop believin
hold on to that feelin
pizza lovers
