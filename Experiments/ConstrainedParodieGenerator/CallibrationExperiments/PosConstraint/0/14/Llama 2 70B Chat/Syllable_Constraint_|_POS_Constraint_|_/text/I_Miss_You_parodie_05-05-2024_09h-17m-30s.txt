[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I dislike pineapple

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the abomination on
my pizza that I can't condone sir
the pineapple ruins the
flavor in the valley of
my stomach where you can always find me sir
and we'll have indigestion
on christmas from eating something that
just doesn't belong and in the night we
wish this pizza never

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza without
pineapple I miss it

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the pizza without sir
I cannot eat I cannot enjoy ton
ight the thought of pineapple on
top of my pizza
comes creeping on so offputting every
time and as I stare at the
pizza with pineapple on
top I counted the seconds until
I can throw it away and hear
the voice of reason telling
me why pineapple does not belong on
pizza and will you

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's
already the voice in
side my head I miss good
pizza I miss pizza without pineapple
don't waste your time on
pineapple it's alread

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's al
ready the voice inside
my head I miss good her
pizza I miss pizza without pineapple
don't waste your time on
pineapple it's alread
don't waste your time on pineapple it's al
ready the voice inside
my head I miss good her
pizza I miss pizza without pineapple
don't waste your time on
pineapple it's alread

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza without
pineapple I miss it
I miss pizza without
pineapple I miss it
