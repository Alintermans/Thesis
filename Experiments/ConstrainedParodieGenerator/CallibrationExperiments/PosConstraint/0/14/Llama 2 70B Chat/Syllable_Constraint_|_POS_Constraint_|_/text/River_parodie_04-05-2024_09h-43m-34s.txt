[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater, been a
been a criticizer of
all the pineapples on pizza need a new home in the bin
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the pineapple

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's coming to the table with a topping
that's making me sick to my gut
sweet potato and ham they don't
match pineapple doesn't belong in a group chat
it's a flavor bomb it's a taste disaster like
a bad snapchat filter it's a mess it
needs to go back where it came from far away from my plate
and don't even get me started on the texture clashes with the
crust it's like biting into
a spiky ball of confusion it's just not worth the pain
and you don't fuck with the classic recipe
even I know that but she's devised a plan to ruin
the pizza game forever with
a topping that's just not worth the risk so she's been on
the web lately spreading lies and hate trying to make it seem like
it's the next best thing since sliced bread but I know
she's just trying to stir up controvers

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater been a been
a criticizer of all
the pineapples on pizza need a new home in the bin well
little one I don't want to admit to something if
all it's gonna cause is pain the
truth and my lies now are falling like the rain so
let the pineapple fall

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one pizza stand turned into a two
topping disaster it was come and go now it
s hurting me so bad he found out now she
feels betrayed and confused cause he left and now
it's just a mess so how am I supposed to tell this
girl that we're through it's hard to find the words I'm alo
of nervous and sue don't want this to hurt but what you
deserve is the truth don't take it personal I just can't say this
in person to you so I revert to the studio like a hole
in the wall diner don't have to be
reserved in a booth I just feel like the person who
I'm turning into is irreversible I preached on you
like it's church at the pew and now that I got
you I don't want you took advantage
in my thirst to pursue why do I
do this dirt that I do get on my soapbox and
preach my sermon and speech detergent and
bleach is burning the roof
of my mouth cause now with the pineapple in
the womb we can't bring it into this world shoulda knew to
use

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater been a been
a criticizer of all
the pineapples on pizza need a new home in the bin well
little one I don't want to admit to something if
all it's gonna cause is pain the
truth and my lies now are falling like the rain so

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
protection before I
bitten

apple run
call me river run we
let the pineapple run call me call

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride he
fuck can I say if life was a highway
and bad pizza toppings were an enclave I'd be swerving
in five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on
ice maybe that's why I came at you side
ways I can't keep my lies
straight but I made you terminate my slice
this pizza triangle left us in a mess tang
led what else can I say it was fun for a
while bet I really woulda loved your
smile didn't really wanna abort but what
the fuck it what's one more lie to tell our

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
unborn child I've been a hater
been a criticizer of
all the pineapples on pizza need a new home in the bin

if all it
s gonna cause is pain the truth
and my lies now are falling like the rain so let
the pineapple fall let
