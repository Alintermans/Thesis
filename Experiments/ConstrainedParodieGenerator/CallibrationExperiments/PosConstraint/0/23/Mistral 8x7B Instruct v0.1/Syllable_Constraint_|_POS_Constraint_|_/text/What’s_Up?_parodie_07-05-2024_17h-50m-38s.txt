[Verse 1]
two tires worn and my taste
triggerless to try this fruit on a pizza
perception flawed it seems
I tried quickly when it sounded so wrong
understood that pineapple's place is not upon a
cheese and tomato scene

[Pre-Chorus]
and thus I chuckify when silly thoughts arrive
only to express what an outlandish
and I i seem addled somewaynearadays
but once my will at no delay and my might well so
and my being all wide ariseways or
and my being in the know of what
its turned doing

[Chorus]
and I sing hum b ab

I sing yaas we knows going on
and I call eon I

[Verse 2]
or he tries
oh me pity trying
it sets every
on that lunation food
but his will
oh I adulates
his seeking every single
that I desire

[Pre-Chorus]
and still my can when firstly my wants give over
nevermoremoremoremoreore
but its what felted be some odd times sortimes
nor everly she rise until a decision and
nor her being all alive raiseablement
or her being on that instant in
my happening

[Chorus]
