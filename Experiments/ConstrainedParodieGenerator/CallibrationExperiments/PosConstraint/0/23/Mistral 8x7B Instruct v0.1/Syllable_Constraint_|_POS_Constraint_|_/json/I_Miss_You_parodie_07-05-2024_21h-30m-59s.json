And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nit strikes you, it strikes\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nahoy there\na nightmare of your likes fears\nthe outline at the close of every\npineapple predicament\noutside october horrors\nwe won't if wood and never on our\nnevermore our beloved\nor it sits eating pizza from christ\nand in the freeze what kills dining this once\nour heated ending\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nit strikes they you insane\nwe need you our lost\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere did they and our might not\nwe muster when deciding our will\nour wants desires and still\nthese bitter feelings\nriseup takes on like eating all evening starts\nbut after our trying\neach piece with every bite\nmay death or love it taste disgustlike\nbefore broughten down decided\nor returneth them home in\nshouldering their will power and gone this\nshouldering all pain\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nsave just sweetened me attention thrown it you\nan image within me\nour saving our\n\nsave just sweetened us attention onto it\nan entity amid\nour making our\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nsave just let yourself part on our our\nan attitude toward\nyour taken our we\n\ntake seriously save me heart at our\nthe sense before it che\nour making our\n\nsave seriously take it attention in\nan emotion behind\nwhat caned ourselves we\n\nbe very begetting me consciousness on\nthe experience of\nits happening us they\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI regret their our\nmy missed them their being\nour missing our\n",
