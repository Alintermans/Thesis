[Verse 1]
I picked up the slice with you, the cheese
was warm and melted on the pineapple mess
but something told me it was not meant to be
and I left my appetite for pizza at

[Verse 2]
your place with sadness and regret eating me up whole
I missed the classic taste of pepperoni
autumn came swinging down while protestors outside
yelled out loud their hate against the pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
but my beloved pizza is
a disasterzone denied
and my stomach growled fiercely but my heart just sighed
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
with the taste embedded in my every
hearing pineapple mentioned makes me queasy oughughughugh
oh in me tastebud is
my ruined my all together
