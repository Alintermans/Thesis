do you taste hawaii in your
been pondering why pineapple's frowned upon on a pie
the sweet and savory clash in your mouth
feel the bitter disgust that it
should've never been allowed on a dish

this heated debate takes center stage causing a riotous
like a drunkard stumbling home at midnight in

wantin' pineapples on your slice instead of pepper
on your every given pizza occasion
that everyone's hopin' for a more conventional
