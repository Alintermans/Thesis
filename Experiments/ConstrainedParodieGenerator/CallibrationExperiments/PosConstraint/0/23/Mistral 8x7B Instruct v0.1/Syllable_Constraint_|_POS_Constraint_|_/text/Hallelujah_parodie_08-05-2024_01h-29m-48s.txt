[Verse 1]
now I recall hearing a caustic
claim that pineapple's delicious on
a slice of pizza pie do you agree dear friend
but let me sing to you my case
the heated pitch the twisted grace
of ham and cheese sans pineapple is heaven

[Chorus]
oh no on pizza pineapple
oh no on pizza pineapple

[Verse 2]
you once tried it and your faced twisted
its sweetness with the savory
you gasped in shock pineapple does not belong

and that you'll never sing another pizza

[Chorus]
oh no on pizza pineapple
oh no on pizza pineapple

[Verse 3]

me treating thusly merely locked
and in your haste you only yourself imposed
these sacred grounds molested by tartness

[Chorus]
oh no on pizza pineapple
oh no on pizza pineapple

who brings wasting from those fruits on
without delight at them lies and sneers towards

[Chorus]
oh no on pizza pineapple

oh no on pizza pineapple
etc credits to le
oh no on pizza pineapple
oh no on pizza pineapple
repeat n amount times credits

[Outro]
oh no on pizza pineapple
