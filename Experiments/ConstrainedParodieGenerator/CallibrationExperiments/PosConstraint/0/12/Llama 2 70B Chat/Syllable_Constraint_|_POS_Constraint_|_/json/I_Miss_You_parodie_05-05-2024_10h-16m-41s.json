And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nmy woes I do express\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nthessepine\nwhich choice out I presences\nan area of an applebaum in\nthe hot fast approaching car\nas sweet like a window kid\nyour icy red with icy and very off\nnot my beated longingly\nor my be love understood for fla\nor like that tree my being makes the most\nits got be a very\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nmy wo I my did it\nyour could your my being\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere does our and our goes\nmy beaded so comes our going now\nit leaves skin or ever ever\nthe best believe ill\ncover does with in could no care omitto\nand of its beaded its seems\nall choices on these all terms\ncan image but need I vision care\nabout retribution to stay\nand remember they ices\ncan your did hearing but isedited\nhas every chose\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nplease how be I choice that your our have not\nsome sense for him ices\nyour are our our\n\ndo not how what waste of I our did once\nwhich nice from me yoursels\nour has its our\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nplease why can he others on themselves what is\nall lies while they image\nits seems our my is\n\nbeamed where were we choices than our our\nwhich care about I lives\nits is my their doing\n\nbeaming where being us image before it\nwhich one with it ice starts\nour have our its\n\ngeting very can me time in them what did\nthis want de he issues\nmy will it your do them\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nyour had it my choosing\nits would we our do\nyour is he our will\n",
