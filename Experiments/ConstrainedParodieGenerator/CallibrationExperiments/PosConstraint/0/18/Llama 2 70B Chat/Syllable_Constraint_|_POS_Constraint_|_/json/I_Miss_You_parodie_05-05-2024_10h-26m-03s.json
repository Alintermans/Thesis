And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nmy wo I my missing\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nellowo\na nutter in I ad mare\nno hoe in all alle ough no ar dentil\na unsight venific ple\nat valle at no livesay\nmy seded do on decwill n verywhere\nven their is always islay\nand my am ill ether with santa\nand as all alsome he r do no how\nour sed ded a not\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nmy sed us our sed\nmy am our your am\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere do I or my may never\nwhat ave how done my will never\nmy does net or ever ever\nall ut time eng au\nmi dided with on am no one ill boyfri\nand if my could our ded\nan fiesta per the all\nmay time or miss it times year year year\nby fi out do you my us it\nbut be you hourses as see\nbe me did adieses nor be any\ncan any way shape\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nsave how do we time by our your missing\nwhich widdo de our\nmy be his what tell me\n\nmake why see it als like our your did once\nall wid along who day\nour seded we it\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nsave where do yourself trouble in yourself us\nan body like they way\nyour is your my does what\n\nsave how go you nobody at yourself you\nany ill because me\nits dided yourself him\n\nknow very do myself thing before himself\nevery man because\nmy coulded them myself\n\nseeing where will us man at her her doing\nwhich ill ough he trouble\nit make his our are\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nmy may his me missing\nme see I our can\nyour seeing her himself\n",
