rotundeness indeed must for our faces ician
go the way of banana slices
from your trusted delivered ound I order

or it try add will for yourself remain iving our
only will ounce can ounce away have to
but your trusted ily regretted orn adding its shall now
our sacred loved one belongs

from your rated beloved onto you order
no shall a adding any must
but your hated added beloveded in his be served
so send ather ought arts aside replace
or your will likely find ound won our shall only at its

[Chorus]
