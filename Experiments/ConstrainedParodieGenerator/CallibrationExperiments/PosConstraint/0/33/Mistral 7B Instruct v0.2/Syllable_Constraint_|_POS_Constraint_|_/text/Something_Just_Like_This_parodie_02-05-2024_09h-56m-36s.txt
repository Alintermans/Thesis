oh I want something just like this

doo duet duet do
doo duet duet
doo duet duet do

how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with a tropical surprise
some exotic fruit
some unusual
just something I can enjoy
somebody I can prize
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
this doo duet duet doo du
this doo duet duet doo du
this doo duet duet doo du
