[Intro]
come on pizza lovers gathering here tonight

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's disharmony'
I beg you to hold out a hand without it
why can't we agree and stick
to the classic
when tastes collide in a mix dis
trust me it's a replace am
and I'm the plain one remaining oho

[Chorus]
in this kitchen it's just
us vegetarians and meat eat
us vegetarians
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza you're no good alone
why are you resting on the counter
what type of fruit are they on
ringin' the
delivery boy is taking
your pepperoni living
he just wants to know that you're making oho

[Chorus]
in this kitchen it's just
us vegetarians and meat eat
us vegetarians
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go order takeaway far away speed
I don't wanna debate the way it used to be
move past the mediterranean sea
I don't wanna talk about who's orderin'

[Outro]
oh
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
