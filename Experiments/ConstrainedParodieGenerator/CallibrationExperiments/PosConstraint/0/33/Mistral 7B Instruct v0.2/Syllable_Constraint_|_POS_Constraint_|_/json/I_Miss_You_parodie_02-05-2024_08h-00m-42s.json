And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI pine for peace atop\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nhello there\nthe intrusion of this fruit\non my pizza's pristine surface below\nthe unwelcome guest\nof culinary disgrace\nwe can't live with pineapple's\npungent taste on savory\nand in the night we'll argue endless\nwhy pineapple's on our pizza pie\nwe'll argue endlesswhy\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI pine for peace atop\nI pine for peace atop\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere's the harmony of cheese and\ntomatoes ripening away in the\nsummer's sun or in the winter\nchill instead of this\npineapple's intrusion on our dinner\nand as I contemplate its\nplacement on my favorite\ndish it brings me only frustration\nlike ketchup's presence\non a filet mignon ste\nwill you remove the pineapple and save\nour meal tonight\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't pine for pineapple on my pizza\nyou're already the voice\nthat ruins my enjoy\n\ndon't pine for pineapple on my pizza\nyou're already the voice\nthat ruins my enjoy\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndon't pine for pineapple on my pizza\nyou're already the voice\nthat ruins my enjoy\n\ndon't pine for pineapple on my pizza\nyou're already the voice\nthat ruins my enjoy\n\ndon't pine for pineapple on my pizza\nyou're already the voice\nthat ruins my enjoy\n\ndon't pine for pineapple on my pizza\nyou're already the voice\nthat ruins my enjoy\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI pine for peace atop\nI pine for peace atop\nI pine for peace atop\n",
