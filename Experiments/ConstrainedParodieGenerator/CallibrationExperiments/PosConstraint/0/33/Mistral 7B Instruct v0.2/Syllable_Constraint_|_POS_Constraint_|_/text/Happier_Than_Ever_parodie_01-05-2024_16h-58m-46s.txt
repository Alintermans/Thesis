[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our culinary throne
we're tastier than ever known
it's harder to explain

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to contemplate something bold
to top our savory
to keep our tastebud
do you read my foodie
or do you ignore my menu
when you said you craved pineapple
was our pizza even
I knew when you added it toppings galore
you'd ruin the harmony we swore to
and I'd end up more annoyed by your choice ignored be true to the old
but you disregarded the
classics we grew up loving
so if you really wanna know the key to our
happily ever after just

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us anymore our
tastebuds are happier than ever known it's
harder to explain the reason why but we wish it was truer
we'll make our pizza great

[Verse 2]
you call us once more with pineapple
toppings on your mindless quest to change
we cringe and shake our heads in disbelief
'cause you only listen to
your own cravings unrefined
we don't relate to you no
'cause we'd never put pineapple on
our beloved pizza pie

[Verse 3]
and we won't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's just embarrassing we were your everything
and all that you did was make us fuckin'
disappointed in our culinar
y tradition so don't waste the
time we don't have left in our lives and don't try to
make us feel bad for loving the classics we grew up
cherishing every time that you served us right on time
delivered on your promise but you never

[Outro]
you changed the game
disregardin' our traditions
made our memories your
own just leave us alone let us enjoy
