[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping fiasco I'm trapped in a culinary
landslide with pineapple on high up above
I'm just a simple piecrust
I need no sympathy from the cheese and the sauce below ive
been contaminated by the sweet and the savory mixin

[Verse 1]
papa just added a
pineapple ring to the top of my head papa what have
we done to our perfect
margherita pie now it's ruined and
tastes nothing like it used to be papa
ooh I didn't mean to upset your taste bud
carry on carry on as if pineapples

[Verse 2]
too late my recipe
has gone astray sends chills down my palate every
bite feels like a betrayal goodbye
all you traditionalists I must face the truth
papa ooh any pineapple on
I don't
wanna eat it I sometimes wish I'd never

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little anchovy of a
foodie debating the merits of pineapple on
pizza and prosciutto too thunderbolt and herbs
fiery and piquant oh how they make me cringe pineapple on pizza galileo pineapple on pine
apple on pizza no I'm just a simple
piecrust nobody appreciates me he
s just a simple piecrust from a hum
ble kitchen spare him his existence from this
unholy creation pepperoni
will you let me go pepperoni will not let
go pepperoni will not let go pepperon
I will not let go pepperon
will not let go never never
never let me go mamma mia let me go
but the pineapple god has
a slice of paradise put aside for me for me for me
papa can you hear me now papa can you hear me now papa

[Verse 4]
so you think you can smother me in sweetness and
pineapple chunks oh baby can't do this to
me baby just gotta get out just gotta
get right outta here oh mamma mia let me go

[Outro]
o
ooh yeah o
h nothing really matters in this pizza
world anymore nothing
really matters to me any
way the wind blows oh yeah
