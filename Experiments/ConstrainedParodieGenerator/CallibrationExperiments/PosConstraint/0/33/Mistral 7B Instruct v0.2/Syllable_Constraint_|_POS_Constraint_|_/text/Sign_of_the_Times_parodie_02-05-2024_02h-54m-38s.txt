[Verse 1]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
pineapple on a pizza
welcome to this culinary
mystery you're creating an issue with me
you say it's delicious but
it just doesn't fit the flow

[Pre-Chorus]
we never tried it before ried it
why are we always bickering
over fruit on our
pizza pie we never tried it ried
it why are we always bickering ried
over fruit on our

[Chorus]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
pineapple on a pizza land
we gotta find a better blend
just stop your arguing it'll be grand
they said we'd love it side by side
we gotta find a better blend

[Verse 2]
just stop your arguing have the flavor of
your life pineapple on a
pizza takes us higher
remember every bite will be al
right we can find a better
topping somewhere far away

[Pre-Chorus]
we never tried it before ried it
why are we always bickering
over fruit on our
pizza pie we never tried it ried
it why are we always bickering ried
over fruit on our

[Chorus]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
pineapple on a pizza night
we gotta expand our taste
just stop your arguing it'll be brightest
they said we'd love it side by side
we gotta expand our taste

[Pre-Chorus]
we never tried it before ried it
why are we always bickering
over fruit on our
pizza pie we never tried it ried
it why are we always bickering ried
over fruit on our

[Bridge]
we don't mix enough
we should give it a
try before it's all too
done will we ever
find a better blend
it's just what we know

[Outro]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the times
we gotta find a new
topping we got to try it try it try it out
we got to find a new topping we got to give
it a try it try it out we
got to try it try it try it
out we got to try it try it
