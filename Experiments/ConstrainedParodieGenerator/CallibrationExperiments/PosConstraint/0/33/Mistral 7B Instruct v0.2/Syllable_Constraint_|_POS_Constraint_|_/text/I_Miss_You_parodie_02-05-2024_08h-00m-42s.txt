[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the intrusion of this fruit
on my pizza's pristine surface below
the unwelcome guest
of culinary disgrace
we can't live with pineapple's
pungent taste on savory
and in the night we'll argue endless
why pineapple's on our pizza pie
we'll argue endlesswhy

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the harmony of cheese and
tomatoes ripening away in the
summer's sun or in the winter
chill instead of this
pineapple's intrusion on our dinner
and as I contemplate its
placement on my favorite
dish it brings me only frustration
like ketchup's presence
on a filet mignon ste
will you remove the pineapple and save
our meal tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't pine for pineapple on my pizza
you're already the voice
that ruins my enjoy
don't pine for pineapple on my pizza
you're already the voice
that ruins my enjoy

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't pine for pineapple on my pizza
you're already the voice
that ruins my enjoy
don't pine for pineapple on my pizza
you're already the voice
that ruins my enjoy
don't pine for pineapple on my pizza
you're already the voice
that ruins my enjoy
don't pine for pineapple on my pizza
you're already the voice
that ruins my enjoy

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
