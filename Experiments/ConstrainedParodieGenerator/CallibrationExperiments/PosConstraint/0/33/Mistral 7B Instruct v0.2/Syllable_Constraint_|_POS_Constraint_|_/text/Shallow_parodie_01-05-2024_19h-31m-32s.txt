[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something's true
does a pineapple really belong
to a pizza's crew
or does it need a new home long gone

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm oppos
in all the good bites I find myself hopin
for a
and in the bad chews I dread myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something qu
are you tired of this pineapple du
or do you need more
it's a mystery keepin up the score

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm oppos
in all the good slices I find myself long
for a
and in the bad tastes I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end pizzawideopen
I'll never meet the ground
crash through the toppings where they can't
deny us our right to

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pie shawava
in the sha pie sha la la la low
in the sha pie shawava
we're far from the hollow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ho ah ha
oh ah ho

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end pizzawideopen
I'll never meet the ground
crash through the toppings where they can't
deny us our right to

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pie shallow
in the sha pie sha la la la low
in the sha pie shallow
we're far from the shallow now
