[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it wasn't right somehow
a slice of pineapple on your pizza pie
now ruins the taste for me every time

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple on a pizza it just doesn't
belong there it's a culinary blunder
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
but the memory of that topping brings me

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's savory
but it's not a delight at
all I'm trying to forget about it all now
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little pizza
you almost ruined the meal with your strange addition's allure
toppings on my pie I
remember it all too well now

[Verse 3]
picnic basket on the picnic blanket spreadwide open
your eyes were wide with wonder as you offered me a bite tenderly
but the memory of that pineapple on the pizza pie
leaves a bad taste in my mouth every time I think
and you kept insisting it was a delicacy divine
but all I could taste was disappointment and pine
and you were offering me another slice to no
avail I pushed it away feeling defeated and blue
'til we were full and finished and left
and then you wondered why it tasted so off
check the ingredients and
come back swearing it's the same mistake all over again
and then you apologized for the mistake you made

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's
the same mistake all overag
ain but I can't forget about it
no matter how hard I try now

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing about the merits of this culinary
nightmare I remember
it all too well now forever
toppings on my pie I remember it all too well
toppings on my pie I remember
toppings on my pie
I remember it all too well

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I preferred the class
ics but this thing was a disasterpiece
that you insisted
was delicious I was
there I remember it all too
well forever toppings on my pie I remember it all
too well forever toppings on my pie I remember it
all too well forever toppings on my pie I
remember it all too well all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time I see a pineapple
on a pizza pie it brings back the memories of our quarrel
and the idea you had
of me as someone who'd eat anything you
prepared no matter how absurd it seemed that's what happened you who charmed me
with your creativity but then
I saw the pineapple on the pizza
pie and I realized
it was a deal breaker for me hencefor
those memories of our shared meals no longer
bring joy to my heart they only remind me of a mistake we
both wish we never made leaving me feeling empty and

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to go back to the days before you introduced me to this
abomination on a pizza pie but I'm still
trying to find a way to move on and accept
that the memory of that pineapple on the
pizza pie will haunt me for eternity but you
keep my old favorite to
ppings in the freezer from that very

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again
when I loved you so much before pineapple on a
pizza ruined it all
it was rare I was there before
pineapple on a pizza
I remember it all
toppings on my pie you
remember it all too
well before pineapple
I remember it all too

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at keeping promises but the punch
line goes I'll get older but your pineapple
on a pizza pie will always stay the
same and from the first time you served it to me
I've been a disappointed soldier
returning from the battlefield of our love
and did the pineapple on
our pizza pie maim us both in the
name of experimentation
or did it just bring us closer

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim us all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well forever to
ppings on my pie I remember it all
toppings on my pie I remember
toppings on my pie I remember
toppings on my pie I remember it all
toppings on my pie I remember it
toppings on my pie I remember
toppings on my pie I remember
toppings on my pie I rememb
er it all too well forever toppings
on my pie I remember it all
toppings on my pie I remember
toppings on my pie I rememb
er it all too well forever toppings
on my pie I remember it all
toppings on my pie I remember
toppings on my pie I remember it all

[Spoken Outro]
I hate you guys so much
