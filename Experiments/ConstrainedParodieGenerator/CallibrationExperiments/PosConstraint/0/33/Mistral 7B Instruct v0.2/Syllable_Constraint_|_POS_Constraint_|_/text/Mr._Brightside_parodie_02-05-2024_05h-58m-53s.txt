[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin'
fine till you put that pineapple on my pizza
it started out as a pie so simple and charming back
then how did it end up with this tropical intr
usion it was only a topping but
now it spoils it every time I take a bite
now I'm pushin' it away and my taste buds
are in a fight and it

[Pre-Chorus]
but you keep insisting it
tastes delightful with ham
let me go
I just can't accept this pineapple
manipulation

[Chorus]
pineapple prejudiceturning food
into a confusing bro
choke on your apologies
but it's just the sacrifice
pizza destiny calling
open up my critical
eyes cause I'm mister

[Guitar Solo]
