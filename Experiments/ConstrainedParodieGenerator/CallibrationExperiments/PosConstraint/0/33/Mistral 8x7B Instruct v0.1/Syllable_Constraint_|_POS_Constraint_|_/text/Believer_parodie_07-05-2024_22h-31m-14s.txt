[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
it's a fruit that doesn't belong
in a savory dishlike this
in a savory dishlike this

[Verse 2]
second things second
ham and cheese is the classic pairing but pineapple
ruins the harmony
it's a shame because it's
a sweet mistake in disguise oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet pure
margherita and pepperoni
but when pineapple hits the scene
my taste buds scream in protestation saying icking
yuck and yuck again and again
rejecting it with every
fiber of their being and so
should you when it comes to pizza

[Chorus]
pineapple you're the worst you make me
scoff disdain
pineapple you ruin the flavor
destroy the taste disdain
pineapple oh let the disapproval flow
our refusal it's
immense we won't
eat you on

[Verse 3]
third things third
save the pineapple for a dessert
or a tropical drink
it's not meant to be on a pizza slice
it just doesn't sink oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking my head in
disgust at the sight of pineap
ples on pizza pies a sacri
legious act against our taste
buds it's time to take a stand and say no to pineap
ple on pizza pies it's time to say no to pineapple on
pizza pies no

[Chorus]
pineapple you're the worst you make me
scoff disdain
pineapple you ruin the flavor
destroy the taste disdain
pineapple oh let the disapproval flow
our refusal it's
immense we won't
eat you on

[Verse 4]
last things last
it's time to set the record straight once and
for all pineapple has no
place on a pizza pie it
just doesn't belong oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
and so we say no to pineapple on pizza and
let the world know that we won't stand for it anymore it
won't slide it

[Chorus]
pineapple you're the worst you make me
scoff disdain
pineapple you ruin the flavor
destroy the taste disdain
pineapple oh let the disapproval flow
our refusal it's
immense we won't
eat you on
