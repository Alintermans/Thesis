[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I shun you, I

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hold on there
the fruit that's out of
order on my pizza sliceparlor
the unwanted guest
at feasts of every kind
it shouldn't even be combinedwith cheese
and tomato sauce disgu
ise it tries to make with its sweetness
but that won't change the fact that it doesn
't belong on pizza pie

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I shun you, I
shun you pineapple you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where did you come from is my first
thought when I see you lying there impost
ering on my pizza like you
have a right to be
others may like you on a pineapple tree
but on my pizza you will
never belong with your sweet
sticky juice and your prickly leavesne
ver let me call you friend tonight
and leave my pizza alone
please leave my pizza alone tonight no
taste of you tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
keep off my pizza you're alreadynot meant
to be there I wish you
would go away I miss
my pizza the way it was before you came
keep off my pizza you
're already not wanted

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
keep off my pizza you're alreadynot meant
to be there I wish you
would go away I miss
my pizza the way it was before you came
keep off my pizza you
're already not wanted
keep off my pizza you're alreadynot meant
to be there I wish you
would go away I miss
my pizza the way it was before you came
keep off my pizza you
're already not wanted

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I shun you I hate you
I shun you I hate you
I shun you I hate you
I shun you I hate you
