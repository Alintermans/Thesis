[Intro]
come on folks, it's time to speak the truth

[Verse 1]
holdin'
pineapple's holdin'
its taste overpowers the rest of the fe
ast won't you just let it be
taste's
when everything gets in the way
dominates the pizza in
disgusting disarray gotta say oh

[Chorus]
in this dish it just won
you know it's not the same as it
in this dish it just won
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza puritans cry out
why is pineapple on the menu at
all ringin' the bell and no
body's comin
to defend this monstrosity
it just brings such a calam
ity oh oh oh say it ain't

[Chorus]
in this dish it just won
you know it's not the same as it
in this dish it just won
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home and make your own pizza pie don
t wanna talk about the way it was left alone
eat homemade and proudly say I won't
let pineapple ruin my beloved meal of delight

[Outro]
hey
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
