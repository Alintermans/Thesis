[Verse 1]
two slices tried and my taste
rejects that pineapple on my pizza base
for a taste sensation
I realized quickly when I took a bite
that this topping's not for me no matter
how much they hype it up

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm taking a
bite of this monstrosity that I've made
and I heave with disgust that never fades
and so I toss it in the bin with dreaded dismay
and I curse the trend that led me astray
and I shout from the bottom of your
heart with a sigh

[Chorus]
and I say heyhey
pineapple
I said heyhey you don't
belong on my pizza
and I say
heyhey pineapple you just don

[Bridge]
oh no
oh
oh no way
oh no
oh
oh no way

[Verse 2]
and I tried
oh my gosh did
I try every
possible topping com
and I pray
oh my gosh do I pray
I pray every single day
for delivery

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cringe sometimes when I'm taking a bite
of this monstrosity that I've made and
I heave with disgust that never fades and soo I
toss it in the bin with dreaded dismay and I curse
the trend that led me astray and I shout from
the bottom of your heart with a sigh
heyhey

[Chorus]
and I say heyhey pine
apple you
don't belong on my pie
and I say heyhey pine
apple you
just don't belong here tonight
and I say heyhey pine
apple you don't belong on this
pizza
and I say heyhey pineapple you
just don't
belong here tonight I said hey
heyhey pineapple you
don't belong on my pie I said
heyhey pineapple
you just don't belong here tonight
and I say
heyhey pineapple you don't

[Bridge]
oh no
oh
oh no way

[Outro]
two slices tried and my taste
rejects that pineapple on my pizza
for a taste sensation oh
