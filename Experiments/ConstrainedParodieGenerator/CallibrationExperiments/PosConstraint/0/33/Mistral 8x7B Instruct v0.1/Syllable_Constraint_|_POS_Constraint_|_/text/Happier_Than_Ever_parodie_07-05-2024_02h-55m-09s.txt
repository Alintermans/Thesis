[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
my taste buds scream in horror
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just should not be

[Verse 1]
let me ponder for a while and find a clever line
to write a little ditty
to tell you what to doo do
do you taste my recipes
or ignore my culinary
when I say it shouldn't be
do you even listen to
me asking you to understand me oh so well
you do the opposite of what you said
and add it to my pizza shell oh no no no no no no no no
it shouldn't be this hard to
explain it rationally
it's just not meant to be on a pizza pie it's true
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza pie I'm saying
I'm happier than ever free from that slavery
wish I could explain it clearer much to your dismay
but it just should not be on

[Verse 2]
you top it once again with pineap
despite my pleading sighs and tears you
scare me with your audacity and lack of
taste you just don't get it do you no
I don't relate to
I don't relate to
that monstrosity you call a
pizza pie it's just disgust

[Verse 3]
and I don't promote this on my social media
never told anyone to try it too
because that shit's embarrassing you were my friend
and all that you did was add it to my
cheese and sauce oh no no no no no no
you never paid attention to the
rules of pizza etiquette so I cut you off for good oh
you ruined every slice of pizza I had now
just forget about it and move on and let me be it
is my right to choose what goes on my pizza

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
pizza was my favorite food got
ruined by your audacious
addition of pineapple to my pie
ple
ase just
stop
pizza
warfare
