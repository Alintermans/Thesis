[Intro]
should pineapple belong on a pizza

[Verse 1]
when the box is delivered
with the cheese and tomato sauce
an abomination con
cannot believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later with pine
it still doesn't make it right on pizza time and time again
you dream of a savory pie without the sweet and tangy
you search for a plain slice baby that's the only way to dine

[Chorus]
was it over when they put pineapple on
was it over when they cooked it in the dawn
said never to this monstrosis
as I turned and walked away that day
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
should pineapple belong

[Verse 2]
when you see it on a slice
you want to scream and shout
tasty toppings like pepper
should be the only thing

[Bridge]
and did you think I wasn't looking
when they added pine
at least I had the decency
to avoid that kind of crime
only rumors about my pizza
and its delicious
oh lord I would never order
a pizza with pineapple
just to see you turn away
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred awkward slices later
if it's got pineapple baby I will surmise that it will never rate
you dream of a savory slice before it added pineapple
you search for a simple pie baby that's the only way to taste

[Chorus]
was it over when they put pineapple on
was it over when they cooked it in the dawn
said never to this monstrosis
as I turned and walked away that day
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
should pine
should pineapple belong
on a
pizza no no

[Bridge]
think I didn't
when they added pine
at least I had the decency
to avoid that kind of crime
only rumors about my pizza
and its delicious
oh lord I would never order
a pizza with pineapple
just to see you turn away and say
the one thing I've been wanting but no no no

[Outro]
should pineapple belong
should pineapple belong on a pizza no no no no no
should pineapple belong on a pizza
should pineapple belong on
pizza no no no no
should pine
should pineapple belong on a pizza no no
