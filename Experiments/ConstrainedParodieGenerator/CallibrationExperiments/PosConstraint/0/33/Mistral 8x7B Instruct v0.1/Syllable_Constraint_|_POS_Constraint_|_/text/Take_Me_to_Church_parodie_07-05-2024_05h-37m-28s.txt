[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go ical error
don't you dare put pineapple here
it's a culinary sin that
I can't abide by any
more my tastebuds scream
a fruit's place is not on pizza please
believe this truth supreme
we were made for better pairings we
were told from those who know gourmet
please leave the pineapple behind all
together we will grow remote ould
be together we will so
ar while pineapple stays off the
menu I'll remain quite

[Pre-Chorus]
a mercy
mercy mercy

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie I'll never kneel at pineap
ple's altar lies I won't confess my taste bud
sins to pineapple's deceit
oh honest goddess let my pizza
be pineapple
free keep pineapple off my pizza pie I'll ne
ver kneel at pineapple's altar lies I won't
confess my taste bud sins to
pineapple's deceit oh honest god

[Verse 2]
if I am a purist of the good
foods then pineapple is
not invited to the party

we crave a
symphony of flavor not a
fruit salad on a

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie I'll never kneel at pineap
ple's altar lies I won't confess my taste bud
sins to pineapple's deceit
oh honest goddess let my pizza
be pineapple
free keep pineapple off my pizza pie I'll ne
ver kneel at pineapple's altar lies I won't
confess my taste bud sins to
pineapple's deceit oh honest god

[Bridge]
no masters or kings when the meal begins freedom
from pineapple is the sweetest of them all innocence
in the rejection of something so wrongfully
placed on a pizza only then can I truly taste

[Pre-Chorus]
a mercy merc
y mercy merc

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza pie I'll never kneel at pineap
ple's altar lies I won't confess my taste bud
sins to pineapple's deceit
oh honest goddess let my pizza
be pineapple
free keep pineapple off my pizza pie I'll ne
ver kneel at pineapple's altar lies I won't
confess my taste bud sins to
pineapple's deceit oh honest god
