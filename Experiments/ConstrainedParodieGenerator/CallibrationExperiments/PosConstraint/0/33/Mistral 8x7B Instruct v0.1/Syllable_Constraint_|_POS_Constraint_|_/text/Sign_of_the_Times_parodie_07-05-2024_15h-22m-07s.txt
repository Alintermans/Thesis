[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a culinary crime
don't you think it's gross inside
you can't mask the flavor with tomato sauce
it's not fooling anyone
it's just not good food true fans

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted better let's
face the facts and change our ways before
the pitchfork
mobs come marching in demanding take
back our pizzas from this abomine
we've tasted better let

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice it's a sign of
the times we gotta keep our
pizzas pure we gotta keep them
pure put down that pineapple slice they told
me sweet and savory don't
mix on a pizza we gotta

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and take a bite
of pepperoni instead
it won't disappoint you
remember how delicious real pizza
should taste we can indulge in
the classics far away from

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted better let's
face the facts and change our ways before
the pitchfork
mobs come marching in demanding take
back our pizzas from this abomine
we've tasted better let

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice it's a sign of
the times we gotta keep our
pizzas pure we gotta keep them
pure put down that pineapple slice they told me
sweet and savory don't mix
on a pizza we gotta get

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted better let's
face the facts and change our ways before
the pitchfork
mobs come marching in demanding take
back our pizzas from this abomine
we've tasted better let

[Bridge]
we should speak our minds
we can all
agree that pineapple
has no place on a
pizza we've been here
before it's just what

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice it's a sign of the
times we gotta keep it
real we got to get away from this travesty
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got
to get away we got to get
away we got to get away
