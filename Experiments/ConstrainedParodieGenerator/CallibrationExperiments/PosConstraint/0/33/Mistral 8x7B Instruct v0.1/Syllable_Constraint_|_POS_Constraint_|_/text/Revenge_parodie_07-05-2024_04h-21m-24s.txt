[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to disregard
the taste of pineapple on my slice
I think that's the first step
you agree

[Verse]
I've tried two pies for us my friend
can't pretend that I enjoyed that trend oh man what a
disaster the taste I send If I
could turn back time I would not contend with pine
on my pizza some hate it some
think it's just fine but you'd have thought I'd give it a try and
now I'm stuck with this taste that just won't
fade I don't wanna suffer more so in my grave it'll
stay I've tried two pies for us friends
can't pretend that I enjoyed that trend oh man what a
disaster the taste I send If I
could turn back time I would not contend with pine
on my pizza some hate it some
think it's just fine but you'd have thought I'd give it a try and
now I'm stuck with this taste that just won't
fade I don't wanna suffer more so in my grave it'll

[Chorus]
in my grave it'll
stay in my grave it
'll stay in my grave it'll stay
rot rot rot in may
in my grave it'll stay in
my grave it'll stay

[Outro]
in my grave it'll
stay I'll stay I'll stay it
won't fade is my taste
your dismay enjoy it today
enjoy
