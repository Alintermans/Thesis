[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to savor the
taste of pizza heavenly he
now in the morning I sigh alone
missing the taste I used to

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to add pineap
ple to my pizza with a grin wide
looked forward to sinking teeth
into the sweet and savory treat now
one bite in and I regrett
ed the choice I had
and I realized my slice stood on a base
of lies and false pretenses baked in haste

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear new york chefs a ringing bell's
praise for pineapple on pizza spread
be my judge and jury on this
taste test before the final verdict is
for some reason I can't explain
once you tasted it there
was never an honest
word and that was when pineapple

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was an unholy union
pineapple on pizza thrown in
shattered crust and the taste in my mouth
people couldn't believe what I'
d allowed to enter in
heretics call for my head on
a silver plate aw who would ever wanna
serve pineapple on a pizza plate

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear new york chefs a ringing bell's praise
pineapple on pizza spread their ways
be my judge and jury on this
taste test before the final verdict is
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't call my
name never an honest
word but that was when pineapple
