And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI shun you, I\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nhold on there\nthe fruit that's out of\norder on my pizza sliceparlor\nthe unwanted guest\nat feasts of every kind\nit shouldn't even be combinedwith cheese\nand tomato sauce disgu\nise it tries to make with its sweetness\nbut that won't change the fact that it doesn\n't belong on pizza pie\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI shun you, I\nshun you pineapple you\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere did you come from is my first\nthought when I see you lying there impost\nering on my pizza like you\nhave a right to be\nothers may like you on a pineapple tree\nbut on my pizza you will\nnever belong with your sweet\nsticky juice and your prickly leavesne\nver let me call you friend tonight\nand leave my pizza alone\nplease leave my pizza alone tonight no\ntaste of you tonight\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nkeep off my pizza you're alreadynot meant\nto be there I wish you\nwould go away I miss\n\nmy pizza the way it was before you came\nkeep off my pizza you\n're already not wanted\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nkeep off my pizza you're alreadynot meant\nto be there I wish you\nwould go away I miss\n\nmy pizza the way it was before you came\nkeep off my pizza you\n're already not wanted\n\nkeep off my pizza you're alreadynot meant\nto be there I wish you\nwould go away I miss\n\nmy pizza the way it was before you came\nkeep off my pizza you\n're already not wanted\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI shun you I hate you\nI shun you I hate you\nI shun you I hate you\n",
