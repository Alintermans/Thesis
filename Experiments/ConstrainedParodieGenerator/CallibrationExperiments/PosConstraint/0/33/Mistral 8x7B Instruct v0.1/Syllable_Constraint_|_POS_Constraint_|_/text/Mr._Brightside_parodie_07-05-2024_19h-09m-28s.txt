[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
pizza stone cold now cause I wanted pineapple
it started with a slice now my heart feels so trite austin
it was only a bite it was only a bite
now I'm full of regret and I'm cleaning my plate
while pineapple's savored and the cheese melts away
now they're cooking again and my stomach's in a
pitiful state and it

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're adding more pineap
please take it away now
can't
it's making me gag and it's
ruining the taste

[Chorus]
pineapple disgustin' my tastebud
swimmin' through sickening bit
choke on this monstrosity
but it's just the price I pay
sanity is mocking me
open up my hungry eyes
cause I'm mr no

[Guitar Solo]
