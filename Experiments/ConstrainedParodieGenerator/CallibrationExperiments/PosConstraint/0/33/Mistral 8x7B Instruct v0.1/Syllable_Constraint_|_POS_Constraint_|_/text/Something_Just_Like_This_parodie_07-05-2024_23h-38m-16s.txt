[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the trends
anchovies and
pepperoni and am
examining the
ingredients I add
but clearly I don't see pineapple on that list

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said cheese and tomato
is that too bland to risk
I'm not looking for something fake
on a pizza I can't
abide pineapple
a tropical twist
just something I can savor
a slice I can enlist
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo duh doo doo
doo duh doo doo do
doo duh doo doo duh du
oh I want something just like this
doo duh doo doo duh du
doo duh doo doo do
doo duh doo doo duh du
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the trends
the veggie p
and bbq blend and
but pineapple remains
a culinary sin
and I'm not the kind of person that it fits

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said pepperoni or sa
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for somebody
with pineapple on their dish
some food aberrant
some tropical twist
just something I can savor
a slice I can enlist

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo duh doo doo duh du
doo duh doo doo do
doo duh doo doo duh du
oh I want something just like this
doo duh doo doo duh du
doo duh doo doo do
oh I want something just

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where do you wanna
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for somebody
with pineapple on their dish
some food aberrant
some tropical twist
just something I can savor
a slice I can enlist
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
