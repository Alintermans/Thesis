[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine all the time
but now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his hunger growling loud
mouth watering for pizza now
but then he sees the pineapple on
top and turns it down with a frown and a pouty
he'd rather order pepperoni or sausage
but she insists on the pineapple and
he can't take it no more can't ignore it no more
so he gets up and walks out the door saying pineapple on
pizza's a sin and he won
t stand for it no more so he's on the phone calling for
delivery from the local pizzeria
stomach growling for some real pizza not that fake stuff with
pineapple on it he says no
way and orders a large pepperoni with extra
cheese and he can't wait to dig in and enjoy his feast saying
pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza
that's just the way it is and always will

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine all the time
but now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand yeah
it was come sunrise scram now we hug tight and
he can't believe she ordered pineapple
on the pizza again he's had enough he
can't take it no more can't ignore it no more
he says it's time for a change can't you see
it's not right to put pineapple on pizza that's just plain
wrong he says and he gets up and leaves saying no more pineapple for me
he can't believe he let it go on for so long but now he's drawn
a line in the sand and he won't cross
it no more he's done with pineapple on pizza for
good he says and he sets off to find a new love a new slice
of heaven without the pineapple he knows
it's out there somewhere he just has to find
it and he will never look back he
says goodbye to pineapple on pizza for good
forever and ever he says it's time
to move on and find a
new love a new slice of pizza without the
pineapple on top no more he says goodbye to pineapple
on

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine all the time
but now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's river my name
is no
pi
neapple river
call me no pineapple
we'll let the river run without pine

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride he
says can't believe he let pineapple
on pizza get the best of him can't believe he let
it ruin his love life like it did he says it's
time for a change can't you see it's time
to move on and find a new
love a new slice of pizza without the
pineapple on top no more he says goodbye to
pineapple on pizza for good he says it
was fun while it lasted but now it
s time to say goodbye to pineapple on
pizza for good he says it's time to move on

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine all the time
but now my stomach's in a bind gotta realign my mind
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
I fucked up
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run
