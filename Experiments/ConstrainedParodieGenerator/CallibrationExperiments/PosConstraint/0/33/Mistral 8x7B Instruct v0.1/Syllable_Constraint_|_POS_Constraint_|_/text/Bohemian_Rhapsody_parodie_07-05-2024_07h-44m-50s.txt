[Intro]
is this a bad pizzachoice is pineapple
confusion bringing in reality icing dri
open up your mind and take a bite and see
I'm just a hungry soul who craves some decree
for pineapple's sweet taste is easy to adore yet sour
any way the dough rolls doesn't really matter to me to me

[Verse 1]
ham and cheese I used to
love so much before the pineapple came through view now it
pales in comparison to
what it once had been before that fateful
day I tried it with pineapple on top
tastebuds crying out for savory not
sweet as sugar in any way the wind blows doesn'

[Verse 2]
too late I realized the
truth about pineapple on pizza saucey hands can
t undo the damage done goodbye to
savoring every bite and hello to
regretful stomach growls can't take
it back anymore can
I just wish I'd never tried it at all

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little sliver of pineapple
wedged between the cheese and tomato sauce scaramou
che and ham how could you do this to me it's
fruit salad on a slice of heavenly delight bismillah I say nay we will not accept this monstrosi
ty easy come easy go will you let me
go bismillah no we will not let you go
let him go bismillah no we will not
let you go let me go will not let you go
nay nay nay
let it be o mamma mia the horror of
pineapple on pizza beelzebub
has a special place in hell for
this sacrilegious creation
so you think you can disrespect me in this way
no no no no no no
just gotta get away from this monstrosity now now now now
don't you dare let it near my plate again no no no no no

[Verse 4]
why oh why did I listen to your advice oh
baby I can't take it anymore I just
gotta get away from this culinary
disaster can't stand it anymore oh oh oh

[Outro]

taste and quality are what truly matter
taste and quality are
all that truly matter to me
any way the dough rolls
