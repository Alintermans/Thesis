[Verse 1]
now I've heard there's a culinary
abomination that's a pity
pineapple on a pizza pie yeah you know it
it clashes with the cheese and sauce
the sweetness ruins the
bitter tang of tomato's halleluj

[Chorus]
no pineapple hallelujah
no pineapple hallelujah

[Verse 2]
you say it's just a matter of taste
but once you've tried a slice it'll
ruin your pizza feast yeah she tricked ya sor
ry not sorry but that's the truth
it looks like hell and it tastes uncouth
and from your plate it's an abomination

[Chorus]
no pineapple hallelujah
no pineapple hallelujah

[Verse 3]
they say you can't knock it
til you've tried it but trust me you
don't want this monstrosity on your dish
the texture's all wrong and the flavor
clashes with the pepperoni
it's a culinary abomination

[Chorus]
no pineapple hallelujah
no pineapple hallelujah

[Verse 4]
I tried to be open minded
but pineapple on pizza's a crime
I'll stick with mushrooms or sausage any time
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the pizza gods
with nothing on my slice but marinara

[Chorus]
no pineapple hallelujah
no pineapple hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
no pineapple hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I tried the pineapple before
I know the regret of ordering wrongly
and I've seen the disappointment in your
eyes when you took a bite and saw
the tragedy of pineapple on a pizza

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you said it was
good but now you never order
it again do you remember the taste of
disappointment and regret hallel
ujah it's not a victory
but a culinary abomination it

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a reason for
the combination but all I
learned from pineapple on pizza is how to
avoid it at all costs and it's not a
flavor that you want to savor it
it's a culinary abom
