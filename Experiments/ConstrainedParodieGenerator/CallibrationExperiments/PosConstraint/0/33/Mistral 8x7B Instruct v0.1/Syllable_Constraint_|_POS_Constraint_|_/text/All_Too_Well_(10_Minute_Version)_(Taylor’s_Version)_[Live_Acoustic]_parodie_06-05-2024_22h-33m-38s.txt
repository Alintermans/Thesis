[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my slice there on that greasy plate
and you still have it in your fridge today yet

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet pineapple chunks and my disgusted face
we argued in the kitchen with tomato
stains on our shirtfronts in a heated embrace
but I can't believe it after all these

[Pre-Chorus]
and I thought it was fine but
it tasted wrong all along
and I can't forget the taste of it all too
well oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it is again on that triangle
slice of pizza hell no not again wind in my hair I was
there I remember it all
too well and there you are again

[Verse 3]
toppings album on the table I was shaking my head
you wanted pineapple chunks on a pizza instead well that's just plain
wrong I said to you but you didn't listen to a word I
said and then you wondered why I walked away that day
and I wish that I could forget but I remember it all
too well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
and there you are again justifying pineapple
on pizza and I can't stand it I remember it
all too well oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's
not fine at all oh oh oh oh
and I regret it all too well oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it is again on that triangle slice
of pizza hell no not again wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all
too well and there you are again
and there you are again justifying pineapple
on pizza and I can't stand it I remember it
all too well oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Bridge]
well maybe we got carried away but
pineapple on pizza is
just not the way oh oh oh oh oh oh
and I regret it
all too well oh oh oh
I remember it all too well
and I can't believe I ever thought it was okay oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 4]
I can't get the taste of it out of my
mouth oh I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too
well oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I remember it all too well oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it is again on that hated
slice of pizza hell no not again wind in my hair
I was there I regret
it all too well oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 6]

t get the taste of it out of my mouth oh
I'd like to be my old self
again but I'm still trying to forget it

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
