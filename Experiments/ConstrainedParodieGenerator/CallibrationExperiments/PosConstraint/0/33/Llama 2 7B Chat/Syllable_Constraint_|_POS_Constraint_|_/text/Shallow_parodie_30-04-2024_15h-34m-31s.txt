[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza you sayin' no way I beg
or do you need more
is it just a fadore more you know

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm stickin
in the toppings game I've got my ways to go
or do
you're just plain wrong oh no no no no

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
ain't you tired of the fruit on top
or do you need more
ain't it hard to resist more more more

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm throwing
in the toppings game I've got my ways to go
or do
you're just plain wrong oh no no no no

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the pineapple

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the haha ha ha ha
in the haha ha ha ha la la
in the haha ha ha ha
we're far from the pineapple

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ha ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the pineapple

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the haha ha ha
in the haha ha ha ha la la
in the haha ha ha
we're far from the pineapple
