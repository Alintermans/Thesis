[Chorus]
don't put pine
on my pizza don't put
pineapple on my pie don't
make me crave something that

[Verse 1]
I can't believe you'd even suggest it sonny
putting pineapple on a
pizza is just not done don
it's like putting jam on a
hamburger it just don't make
sense to me bro give me a break
pepperoni and sausage
they go together like a dream but pineapple
just don't belong on a pizza please
you gotta respect the classics you know what I mean am I right or
am I wrong will you ever
see things my way or will you
stick with your trendy abomination of a to
pizza that I just can't

[Chorus]
don't put pineapple on my pizza don't
put it on a pie don't make me crave something that
just don't belong on a pizza please give me a break pepper
and sausage they go toget

[Verse 2]
I see you've been at it again
spouting off about pineapple
like it's the best thing since sliced bread
but let me tell you something brother it
ain't no substitute for
quality toppings like pepper
and mushrooms and onions and ol
it ain't no

[Verse 3]
you can keep your pineapple pizza to yourself I'll stick
to the classic toppings that I know and
love like pepperoni and sausage and bacon
don't even get me started on anchov
ies and olives they're like the ultimate
traitors to the pizza cause they just
don't belong on a pizza no matter how you slice it
or how you dice it or how you sauce it pineapple
just don't belong on a pizza and that's the truth so
don't even try to tell me otherwise

[Outro]
so there you have it folks
my stance on pineapple
on a pizza is clear and
unwavering don't even try to
arg
counter
points
mine cause
you won
