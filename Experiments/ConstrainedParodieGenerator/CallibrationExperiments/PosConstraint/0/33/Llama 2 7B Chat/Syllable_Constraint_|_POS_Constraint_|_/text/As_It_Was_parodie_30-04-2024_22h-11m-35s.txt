[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza should not be seen ton

[Verse 1]
stranger danger
sweet and savory don't
you can't have your cake and eat
why can't you just agree with
nobody lik
why waste your time on something that
just doesn't belong on a
piece of bread and cheese and pepperoni

[Chorus]
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it
was as it was yes it

[Verse 2]
can't you see
it just doesn't make sense to
put something tropical on a pie that
was meant to be savory
fruits don't
belong on a pizza don't
you know what I mean don't
they just don't go together like they used

[Chorus]
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it
was as it was yes it

[Bridge]
go back in time when toppings were simple
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave the pineapple on the island where
it belongs not on a pie in a restaurant where

[Outro]
pine
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
