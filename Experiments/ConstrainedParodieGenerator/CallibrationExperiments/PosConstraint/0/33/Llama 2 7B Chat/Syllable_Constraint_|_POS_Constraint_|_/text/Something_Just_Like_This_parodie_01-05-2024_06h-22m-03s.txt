I had a pineapple on
my pizza and it didn
melts in my mouth like a
fiery inferno
burning my taste bud
to ashes below me
I can't believe I made this mistake again and

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said don't you dare go
how much you want to risk

like a tropical delight
some spicy sausage
a little bit of

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where did you go wrong now do you
want to risk it all for
I'm not looking for something sweet
like a tropical resort
some spicy sausage
a little bit of
pepperoni heat instead
I want something that will

oh no pineapple on at
my pizza please oh no don

[Bridge: Chris Martin]

spice things up
give me a topping that
makes me feel alive instead of
dying Inside when I
bite into something
dull and tast

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where did you go wrong
now do you want to risk
I'm not looking for something sweet
like a tropical resort
some spicy sausage
a little bit of
pepperoni heat instead
I want something that will
make my heart sing instead of

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh no pineapple on my at
pizza please oh no don't let
it be a crime against pizza
