[Intro]
I think I'll pass on
that pineapple on my pizza
can't stand the taste or the sight of
it's just not for me tonight
you agree

[Verse]
I've tried it once or twice before
but it's just not my slice of choice anymore after more
the sweetness overpowers the flav
of the cheese and sauce it's a no go for me
some may say it's a topping sens
but I'll stick to the classic combination that never
fades or loses its charm in my book it
ain't happening pineapple on my pizza no way no
I've tried it once or twice before
but it's just not my slice of choice anymore after more
the sweetness overpowers the flav
of the cheese and sauce it's a no go for me
some may say it's a topping sens
but I'll stick to the classic combination that never
fades or loses its charm in my book it
ain't happening pineapple on my pizza no way no

[Chorus]
in my pizza they
in my pizza they
in my pizza they won't
in my pizza they
in my pizza they won't
in my pizza they

[Outro]
in my pizza they
they won't they won't
in my pizza they won
they won't they won't they won
