defies all the laws of nature and reason
for a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
that pineapple doesn't belong on a pie of che

just to get it all out of my mindset
and I feel peculiarly confused every
time I see a pineapple on a pizza and it
makes me want to scream from the top of my voice
and I say with all sincerity

hey pineapple on a
pizza no
hey pineapple on a pizza

[Bridge]

[Outro]
twenty five years and my life
still trying to figure out this pineapple
on a pizza mystery
