[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a crime having pineapple
on a pie that's meant for cheese and
pepperoni and sausage too
that's the way it's always been done hallelu

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah halle

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness to the
savory flavors on the pie
but to me it's just a travesty taking
away from the classic taste that
makes a pizza something to adore
it's just not something I can ignore hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah halle

[Verse 3]
I understand that some may cra
ve something different on their
pizza but to me it's just a sin to put
pineapple on a pie that's meant for win
ning flavors that have always been
a staple of the pizza scene hallelu

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah halle

[Verse 4]
you can top it with whatever
you like but to me it's just not right
ruining a good pizza with pineapple
is just not something I can ab
ide by it's just not worth the fight
hallelujah hallelujah hallelu

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
hallelujah hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
I know some people think it
s bold and adventurous to
put pineapple on a pizza but to me
it's just a recipe for disaster
and ruining a good pizza
crust with pineapple is just not worth the fuss halle

[Additional Lyrics]
I remember when pizza was
simple and classic and never
included pineapple it was a staple
of the italian cuisine and now
it's been tainted with pineapple
and it's just not the same to me hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a time and a
place for pineapple on a pie
but to me it's just not right it's a crime it
s a cold and it's a broken h
allelujah hallelujah some
things are just better left alone hallelujah
