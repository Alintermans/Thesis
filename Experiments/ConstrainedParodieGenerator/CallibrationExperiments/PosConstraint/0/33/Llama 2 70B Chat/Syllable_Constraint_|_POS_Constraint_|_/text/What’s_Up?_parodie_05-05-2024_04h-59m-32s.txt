[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
is a crime against humanity it's such
a culinary ab
I can't believe they put it on a
crust that's meant for savory not sweetness overload
it's like putting ketchup

[Pre-Chorus]
and mustard on a pizza pie it's just not right
I get upset just thinking about the
combination of flavors and textures that just
don't belong together it's like someone's trying
to sabotage the pizza industry and
make it flop like a fish out of wa
ter gasping for

I try to
understand the minds of
those who put pineapp

[Pre-Chorus]
in the pizza game with their strange toppings and their
weird combinations it's like they're trying
to make a mockery of the art of pizza
making and the beauty of a perfectly crafted
pie that's just not right it's like they're trying to
take away our freedom to choose
our toppings

[Chorus]
