[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong it was
like a crime scene without a care but something

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my hungry gaze autumn leaves
falling down like dollars from the sky and I
can picture it after all these days and I know
it's long gone but that magic's not here no more

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that magic's not here no more
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little town
street you almost ran the red because you were looking over
at me pineapple on the
pizza it doesn't belong there

[Verse 3]
photo album on the counter your face was turning red
you used to be a little kid with a big appetite in bed dream
ing of anchovies and sausage and pepperoni galore
and your mother's telling stories bout you on the te
e ball team you told me bout your past thinking your future was
me and you were tossing me the pizza dough to
ssemble the pieces but something was wrong it was a crime
it was a pineapple on top of a beautiful pie
and I was thinking on the drive
down any time now he's gonna say it's love
you never called it what it
was til we were dead and gone and buried check the pulse and
come back swearing it's the same after three months in the

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an
oath sacred prayer and we
d swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paper here
cause I remember it all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you not
weeping in a party bathroom some
actress asking me what happened you that
s what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self effacing jo
kes sipping coffee like you re on a late night
show but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to
come and he said it s supposed to be fun turning twe

[Verse 5]
time won t fly it s like I m paralyz
ed by it I d like to be my old self again but I m still
trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when
you made me your own now you mail back my things and
I walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from
that very first week cause it reminds you of innoc
ence and it smells like me you
can t get rid of it cause you re

[Chorus]

are again when I loved you so back before you lost
the one real thing you ve
ever known it was rare I was

too well wind in my hair

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes

bones I m a soldier who s returning
half her weight and did the twin flame bru
ise paint you blue just between us did the love af
