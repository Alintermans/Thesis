[Verse]
comin' out of my kitchen and I've been cookin' just
gotta gotta be real because I want it all
it started out with a pineapple how did it end up
like this it was only a pineapple it was
only a pineapple now I'm fallin' asleep
and she's callin' a food coma while he's havin
a snack and she's takin' a bite now they're goin'to
bed and my stomach is

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's stuck in my teeth now
he takes off my appet
let me go
because I just can't eat it it's kill
in' me and it's tak

[Chorus]
iniquity turnin' taste buds into
bitter flavors swimmin' through
disgustin' lies chokin' on
your pineapple pizza but
it's just the price I pay dest
iny is callin' me op
en up my eager

[Guitar Solo]
