she's overwhelmed and self assured turned up
oh no I know a dirty word

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low

less disgusting here we are now
I feel gross and contaminant
here we are now ruining it
a pineapple a hawai
a mistake a pizza shouldn't

and for this crime I feel curs
our little pizza has always
been and always will be ruined

hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello how low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings off it's
less disgusting here we are now
I feel gross and contaminant

a pineapple a hawai
a mistake a pizza shouldn't

[Post-Chorus]

a pineapple a hawai
a mistake a pizza shouldn't
