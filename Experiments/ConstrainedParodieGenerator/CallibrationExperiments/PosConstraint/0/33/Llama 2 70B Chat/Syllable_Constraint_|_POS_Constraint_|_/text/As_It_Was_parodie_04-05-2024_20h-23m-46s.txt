[Intro]
come on guys we gotta say no to pineapple

[Verse 1]
holdin'
pineapple's holdin' us back
we don't want it on our pizza that
why don't we leave it
nothin
to say when pineapple gets in
the way seems you cannot be
replaced and pizza's the one who will stay

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the phone
people are callin' to say
why you put pineapple on your pizza
what kind of flavor are you
ringin' a bell
and nobody's comin
your tastebuds live by them
selves they just want to know that you're well oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home get ahead try a new reci
pe I don't wanna talk about the way that it
leave pineapple two slices follow your
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
