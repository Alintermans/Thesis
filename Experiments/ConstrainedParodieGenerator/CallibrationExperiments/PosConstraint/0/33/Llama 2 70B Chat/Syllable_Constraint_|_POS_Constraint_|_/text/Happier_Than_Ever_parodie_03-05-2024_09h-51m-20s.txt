[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
makes me wanna lose my
appetite every

[Verse 1]
can't believe they'd do this to a beautiful pie
ruining the flavor and
the texture it's just not right
do they even care about
the taste or the sight when they put
pineapple on a pizza it
just don't feel right gotta
take a stand and make it right when I'm away from
pineapple I'm happier than ever
wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't true what were they
thinking of when they put that
pineapple on top of a
beautiful pie ruining the flavor and the taste
just can't understand why they

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime makes me wanna lose my appetite every
time I see it it just don't feel right gotta take a stand and
make it right when I'm away

[Verse 2]
they call it a topping a flavor
enhancer but to me it's a sin
combining sweet and savory it's just not
right they must be out of their mind I don
relate to pineapple on
pizza I don't relate to
people who put pineapple on
pizza cause they're ruining

[Verse 3]
the pizza that I love the flavors the textures the way
it's cooked they just don't get it they don
understand the beauty of a pie the way it
should be I could talk about all the times that
pineapple ruined my meal but I'd have
an empty line cause it's just not worth
my time I'll just shut them out and enjoy my pizza the
way it should be without pineapple ruining it
just leave me alone and let me eat my pizza in peace
without pineapple on top of it without

[Outro]
pineapple on top of a
pizza it's just not right it's a crime
against humanity just
leave me alone and let me eat my pie
in
peace please
oh
goddam
please
