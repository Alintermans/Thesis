[Verse 1]
just a simple pizza pielivin' in a world
she took the midnight pie goin' anywhere
just a topping boyborn and raised in flavor town
he took the midnight pie goin' anywhere

[Verse 2]
a pizza in a hot oven
the smell of cheese and fresh toppings
for a slice they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waitin
up and down the menu board
their flavors searchin' in the night
pizza lovers
livin' just to find delicious
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get my fill
everybody wants a slice
payin' anything to taste the che
just one more time

[Verse 4]
some will win some will lose
some are born to love anchov
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waitin
up and down the menu board
their flavors searchin' in the night
pizza lovers
livin' just to find delicious
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin
hold on to that feelin
pizza lovers
don't stop believin
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop believin
hold on to that feelin
pizza lovers
