[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza
toppings would please when I gave the
word now in the morning I eat it
alone sweep the pepperon

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to pick the to

fear in the pepperoni
eyes listen as the crowd would sing now the

slice one minute I held the
key next the pizza was closed on me and
I discovered that my slices stand upon

silver plate just a puppet on a lonely
string aw who would ever want to be

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear people shouting pineapple's a
ringing pineapple cavalry cho
irs are singing be my mirror
my sword and shield my missionaries in
a pizza field for some reason can
t explain once you've gone there was never
never an honest slice
and that was when I ruled the world
