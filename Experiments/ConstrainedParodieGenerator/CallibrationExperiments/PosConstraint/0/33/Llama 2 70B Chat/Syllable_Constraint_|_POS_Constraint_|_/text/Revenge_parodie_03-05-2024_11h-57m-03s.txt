[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to end this debate
about pineapple on pizza it
it's time to put this matter
in its grave

[Verse]
I've heard the arguments for and
against and I've made my choice for pineapple on pizza
it's a no from me there's just no way
that it belongs on top of dough some say it
adds flavor and sweetness but to
me it's just a crime it ruins the taste
of a classic dish that's been enjoyed for
centuries don't get me wrong I love pineapple on its
own but on a pizza it just
doesn't belong in my opinion it's a travesty
a culinary abomina
tion that must be stopped I'd rather eat a plain
pizza with no toppings at all
than have pineapple ruin the flavor of it all it
just doesn't make sense to me and never
will so let's put this debate to rest and bury it deep in

[Chorus]
in our graves we
ll rot in our
graves we'll rot in our gra
ves we'll rot rot rot
in our graves we'll rot in
our graves we'll rot

[Outro]
in our graves we
ll rot is this the end
of pineapple on pi
zza is this the end of the de
bate let
