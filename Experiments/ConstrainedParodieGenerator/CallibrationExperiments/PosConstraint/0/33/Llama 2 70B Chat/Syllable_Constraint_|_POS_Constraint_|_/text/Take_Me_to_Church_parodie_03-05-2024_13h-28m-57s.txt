[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the pineapple on top that'
knows everyone's disapproval I
should've scraped it off sooner
if the toppings ever did speak

every sunday's gettin' more ble
a fresh disaster each
week we were born sick you heard them say
my stomach offers no absol
utes she tells me worship in the
kitchen the only pizza I'll
ever need is one without
pineapple I was born sick but
I love it command me

[Pre-Chorus]

pizzeria I'll worship like a fool at the
shrine of your lies I'll tell you my cravings and you
can sharpen your knife offer

my life take me to the pizzeria I'll war
ship like a fool at the shrine of your lies I'll tell
you my cravings and you can

my pizza's the sunlight

[Bridge]
no toppings or pineapple when the meal begins
there is no sweeter flavor than our classic pepper
oni in the madness and soil of that greasy
kitchen only then I am satisfied only then
