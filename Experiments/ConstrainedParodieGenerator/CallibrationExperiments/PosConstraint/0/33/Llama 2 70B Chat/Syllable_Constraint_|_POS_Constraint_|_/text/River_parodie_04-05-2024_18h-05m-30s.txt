a pizza purist been a cheat saying pineapple has no
business on a pizza treat all my sins need a slice of
reality feel the burnin

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his stomach growling to
catch some heat for his pineapple
on his breath's the smell
of regret and he's a pizza addict and she
just wants to exact revenge and get back at his
pineapple obsession it's a taste match
she's on his back like a jetpack she's kept track of all his
toppings and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next slice
actually just pepper
oni my last pizza and she has what my taste buds lack
'cause she loves flavor psychopath and you don't mess
with no man's pizza even I know that but she's devised
some plan to pineapple his back
knife in hand says their pizza's hangin' by a strand so
she's been on the web lately says maybe she'll be my hawaiian
to spite her man and I know she's using me
to try to play him I don't care hi

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater been a been
a criticizer been a
pineapple purist been a cheat saying pineapple has no
business on a pizza treat all my sins need a slice of
reality feel the burnin
rain well little pizza I don't want to a
dmitt to somethin if

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one pizza stand turned into a two
night stand it was come sunlight scram now we hug tight
and he found out now she feels deserted and
used cause he left so what he did it first to
her too now how am I supposed to tell this girl that
we're through it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous
and sue don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is
the truth don't take it personal I just can't say this in person
to you so I revert to the studio like a hole in the wall
diners don't have to be reserved in
a booth I just feel like the person who I'm turning
into's irreversible I preyed on you like it's church at
the pew and now that I got you I don't
want you took advantage in my pizza
thirst to pursue why do I do this
dirt that I do get on my soapbox and preachmy
sermon and speech detergent and bleach is
burnin' the roof of the
mouth cause now with the pizza in the oven
we can't bring it in this world shoulda knew to use pro te
ction

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater been a been
a criticizer been a
pineapple purist been a cheat saying pineapple has no
business on a pizza treat all my sins need a slice of
reality feel the burnin
rain well little pizza I don't want to a
dmitt to somethin if

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's
river
call
me river
we'll let the river run
call me river we'll let the river

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride he
fuck can I say if life was a highway
and pineapple was an enclave I'd be swerving in five
lanes at a high rate like I'm slidin' on ice maybe
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
but I made you terminate my pizza
this pizza triangle left us in a wrap tang
what else can I say it was fun for a while
I really woulda loved your slice didn
t really wanna abort but fuck it what
's one more lie to tell our unborn child ain

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a hater been a been
a criticizer been a
pineapple purist been a cheat saying pineapple has no
business on a
pizza treat
all my sins need holy water feel it
they washin
over me well little pizza
I don't want to admit to somethin if
all it's gonna cause is
