[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I abhor your presence

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pineapple on my
pizza is a crime against humanit
the toppings in the
background of my meal are uns
uspecting victims of culinary ab
use we can live without you
and we'll have flavor on our tong
ues that actually make sense we'll wish
this pizza was never

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the pizza I ordered
I'm so hungry I cannot eat tonight
I need pepperonI and sa
usage and mushrooms
this strange combination comes creep ing on so
disgusting every time
and as I stare I count the
ways that pineapple does not belong
on my pizza like a bad de
cision to put it on in
the first place will you take it off and stop
this pain tonight stop

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're just
already ruining
the taste don't waste your
time on pineapple you're just alreadythere
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're just
already ruining
the taste don't waste your
time on pineapple you're just alreadythere
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you I miss you I miss
you I miss you I miss
you I miss you I miss
you I miss you I miss you I miss you more
than pineapple on a
pizza I miss you more

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
