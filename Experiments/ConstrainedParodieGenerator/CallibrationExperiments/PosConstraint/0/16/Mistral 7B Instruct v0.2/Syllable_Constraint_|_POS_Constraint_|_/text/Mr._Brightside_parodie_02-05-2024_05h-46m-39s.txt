[Verse]
comin' out of my cocoon and I thought life was fine
gotta hide in the shadows because pineapple
shouldn't be on my pizza pie unexpectedly comb
it started out with delighthow did savory
toppings turn into a tropical disaster
it was only a mistakebut now it's a
late night ordering taking a sabbatical
from my favorite dish

[Pre-Chorus]
but they insist on adding
this fruity addition
let me go
I just can't bear to see tomatoes
and pineapple co

[Chorus]
envy stewin' converting fans into
foods gone awry swimmin' through
karaoke of regret
chokin' on pineapple mis
steppin' outside the comfort
take a bite of tradition
that's the price I pay

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
comin' out of my cocoon and I thought life was fine oh
gotta hide in the shadows because pineapple
shouldn't be on my pizza pie unexpectedly comb
it started out with delight how did savory
toppings turn into a tropical disaster
it was only a mistakebut now it's a
late night ordering taking a sabbatical
from my favorite dish

[Pre-Chorus]
but they insist on adding
this fruity addition
let me go
I just can't bear to see marble
and pineapple co

[Chorus]
envy stewin' converting fans into
foods gone awry swimmin' through
karaoke of regret
chokin' on pineapple mis
steppin' outside the comfort
take a bite of tradition
that's the price I pay

[Guitar Solo]


[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never
