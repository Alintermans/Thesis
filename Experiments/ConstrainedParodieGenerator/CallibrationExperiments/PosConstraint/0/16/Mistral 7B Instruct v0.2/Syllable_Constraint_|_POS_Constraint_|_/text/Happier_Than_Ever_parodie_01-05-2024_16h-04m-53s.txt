[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our beloved pizza dish
I savor every bite with
an uncontrollable

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to pondersomething clever
to construct an argument
to defend my position
do you add it day after
or pick my favorite toppings
upon your entering the store
I knew when I asked you to
be respectful of my preference you'd simply
replace it with your own choiceyou'd ignore
I wish I could explain it betterbut pineapple on pizza seems
unanimously absurd
so if you really wanna
hear my point of view when I'm away from pineapple
I'm savoring every bite

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza it tastes
savoring every bite savory and right it
wish I could explain it better ish I wish it wasn't sour
my hatred for pineapple

[Verse 2]
you load me up with pineapple chunks
disrupting the perfect harmony
your insistence wears me down week after week
with your justification saying it
I don't agree with you
I hold my tongue to avoid a
from our beloved pizza peace
my beloved pepperoni

[Verse 3]
and I refrain from making a sceneonline or offline
respecting your preferences deserves
that's what makes our relationship uniqueand
but the inescapable reality
so save your time I don't haveleft
and accept my reasoning instead
I couldn'ttalk about yourpineapplelessnessonemoment
but my loved ones all aroundare silenced by your choice
so stand back and let me sharethis moment alone with
delightfulness of a pizza without pine

[Outro]
you ruin every taste
insufferably misunderstood
changing every bite meant
just leave me aloneand let me enjoy
che
eso
qu
eso
just leave
