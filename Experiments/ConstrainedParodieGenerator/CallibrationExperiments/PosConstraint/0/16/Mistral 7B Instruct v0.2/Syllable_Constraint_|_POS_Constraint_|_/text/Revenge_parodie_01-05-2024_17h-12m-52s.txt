[Intro]
I ate a pie filled with surprise once
pineapple on top was the unw
elcome guest at my dinner table
my beloved pizza lost its
allure and

[Verse]
two flavors clash in harmony
I just can't abide the sight of pineapple near me
oh sourness reigns wherever meets the
eye if I could forgo that bite no lie we
crave diversity in our
diets but this blend crossed the line is it mine or is it
yours pineapple on pizza puts aside
and our taste buds collide love died our amity now
our combined hatred grows night
bye together we'll rot in our graveside eyes I can
no longer bear to see pineapple
on my beloved pizza pie I yearn to rev
oke this decision and undo
but I don't have the power to undo our shared
bereavement pineapple on pizza put
aside our amity now love died our happiness

[Chorus]
in our pizza
graveside in our
graveside in our graveside
in our pizza
graveside in our pizza
in our pepper

[Outro]
in our pizza
our shared beloved we
can't share it peace till
can this injustice be revers
ed oh
