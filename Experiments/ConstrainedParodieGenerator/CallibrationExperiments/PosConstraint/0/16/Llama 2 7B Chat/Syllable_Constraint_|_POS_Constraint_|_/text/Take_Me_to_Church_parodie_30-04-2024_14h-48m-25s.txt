[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie
my willpower starts to die inside
shouldn't be on top of pizza high
my taste buds start to say goodbye
that's a toxic combination
my mouthwatered all
but pineapple doesn't belong on
no other vegetable
I sing this song of discontentment
we part amicably this time
my willpower starts to die inside
pineapple on pizza is a crime
can't stand the thought of it
its juicy sweetness such a lie
causes my tastebud

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh oh
amen amen

[Chorus]
take it off the
pineapple off the pie take it off the menu
my willpower starts to rise again and again
was it ever really there
pineapple belongs in a fruit sal
not on top of
our sacred fired pasta sauce savory
our loved filled it it hearty but their is is
causing us to part ways cause
my willpower starts to die inside

[Verse 2]
like a bee to honey we both know
it's toppings we cannot
disagreement on pineapple
our divided taste bud
let's agree to disagree civil
donates to healthy choices for
the remaining toppings un
I my willpower starts to
my willpower starts to die in
this willpower battle with you
this willpower thing

[Chorus]
take it off the
pineapple off the pie take it off the menu
my willpower starts to rise again and again
was it ever really there
pineapple belongs in a fruit sal
not on top of
our sacred fired pasta sauce savory
our loved loaded it him hearty but their is
causing us to part ways cause
my willpower starts to die inside

[Bridge]
we part ways friends now there's something I must confess
a willpower secret I must confess I must share with
with each biteful but dark deed there's always a
backlash backlash that's real backlash that's coming for me

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take it off the
pineapple off the pie take it off the menu
my willpower starts to rise again and again
was it ever really there
pineapple belongs in a fruit sal
not on top of
our sacred fired pasta sauce savory
our loved filled it it hearty but their is is
causing us to part ways cause
my willpower starts to die inside
