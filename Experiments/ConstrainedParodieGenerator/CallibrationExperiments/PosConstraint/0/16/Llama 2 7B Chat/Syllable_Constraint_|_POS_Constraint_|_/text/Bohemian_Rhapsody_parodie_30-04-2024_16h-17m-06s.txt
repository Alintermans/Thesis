[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza oh no no no
is this just a dream or is it reality show
open your eyes look closely at the toppings
I can't believe you'd even consider
pineapple on a pizza oh my goodness no way no how
can't you see it's a crime against culinary laws to put

[Verse 1]
momma why would you do
add something fruity and sweet to a savory pie when
father abraham would not
nor jesus himself would condone such a
muncherization of a perfectly
good pizza ruined by a tropical fruit
I for one refuse to partake in such gastronomic

[Verse 2]
when noble toppings like
sausages and pepperoni and mushrooms inter
face competition from something so bland
yellowish and gooey it's a travesty
dragging the reputation of the
pizza industry down
we demand respect for the classic toppings

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
our forefathers would roll over in their
gravesif they saw the atrocities committed
in the name of novelty toppings on a pizza they
worked hard to perfect the perfect pie and now it's all being ruined by people who think pineapple belongs
on a pizza it doesn't belong there it
its a travesty an abomination
things you should never do on a pizza
such as put a fruit on top of a savour
y piece of culinary history
keep the classics keep the tradition keep the flav
let's preserve the integrity of the pizza
make it great again make it great
again and again and again
not more pineapple not more pineapple not more
pineapple on a pizza
never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
oh no no no no never ever ever ever ever no

[Verse 4]
just when we thought it was safe to enjoy a me
almost any pizza without having to end
ure of an impending pineapple onsla
back came the evil pineapple pizza predator

[Outro]
pine
pineapple on
will never be tolerated will never
be accepted never
let alone enjoyed oh no no
the scourge of pineapple
