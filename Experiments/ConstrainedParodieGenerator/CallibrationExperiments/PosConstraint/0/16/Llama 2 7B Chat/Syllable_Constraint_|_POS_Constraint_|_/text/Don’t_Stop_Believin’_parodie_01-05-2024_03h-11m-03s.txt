[Verse 1]
don't put the pineapple on my pizza pie
its flavor just doesn't cut it with the rest
a topping so sweet it makes me want to cry eyes
its icky texture leaves me questioning life

[Verse 2]
a pizza without cheese is just
an insult to food and common
without the king of toppings I
feel like I'm in a foodtime blues band

[Pre-Chorus]
avoidinists
upsetters of tastebud
we needs resisted the urge to
tempers passion
searchin to find the perfect to
edge to soothe our hunger

[Verse 3]
cheesey goodness fills my heart
oh how I long for pizza
jaws' dreams of a melted masterpiece
nowhere in sight

[Verse 4]
a pizza without che
an abomination to
I'll stick with pepperoni
my tastebuds will never be a

[Pre-Chorus]
avoidinists
upsetters of tastebud
we needs resisted the urge to
tempers passion
searchin to find the perfect to
edge to soothe our hunger

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't invalidate
my love for cheese pizza
needs validate
keeping away wasted
knowing
people pursuits
save the pineapple for
is for toppings that suit
life needs standards
