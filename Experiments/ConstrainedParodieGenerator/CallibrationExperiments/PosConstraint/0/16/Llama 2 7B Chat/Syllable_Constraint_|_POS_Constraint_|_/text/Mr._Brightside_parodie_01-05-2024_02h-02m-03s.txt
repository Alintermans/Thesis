[Verse]
step away from the pineapple on my pizza pie
avoidance is key when it comes to my taste bud
it started out with an aroma how could it end up
like this so wrong pineapple doesn't belong on
my pizza don't you agree it's a crime to
add it to the cheese and sauce and expect me to
even consider taking a bite it's just not
right for me pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
but she keeps putting it on
he likes it on his too
gotta keep
let me go tell her no more pineapple
it's a pizza crime

[Chorus]
oh jealousy turning flavors into
something undesirable
licking up the toppings with
excuses and denial
pepperoni should be the
leading the way extra che
on my pizza not

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
I keep distant from the pineapple on my pizza pie
circular reasoning is how I justify
our predicament how did it escalate so fast
its gotta be reversed my taste buds rely on
there's gotta be something I can do to avoid
that fruity topping please don't make me eat it
not my pineapple take it back let me enjoy
my pizza in peace and

[Pre-Chorus]
but she refused to listen
they are in denial
let me go
about my pizza preferences
but being stubborn

[Chorus]
oh jealousy turning flavors into
something undesirable
licking up the toppings with
excuses and denial
pepperoni should be the
leading the way extra che
on my pizza not

[Guitar Solo]


[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never
