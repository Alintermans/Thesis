[Verse 1]
just stop your whining it's a crime against the
pizza we all know is a
masterpiece of culinary
heaven so don't go and ruin it with your
weird obsession with fruit on
top it's just not worth the risk

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted the difference we know
what's right and what's wrong in the pizza game
why are we still discuss
pineapple on pizza it's such a
crime it'll never be the same at all
a weird combination

[Chorus]
just stop your whining it's a sign of the times
we gottta stick to the classics
it'll be alright they told me
pineapple doesn't belong on a pie
it's our duty to keep it
our way we gotta keep it

[Verse 2]
just stop your fighting it's a losing battle
pineapple on pizza is
culinary attempted
abandon ship it's a sinking vessel
your tastebuds will thank you
once you fully understand

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted the difference we know
what's right and what's wrong in the pizza game
why are we still discuss
pineapple on pizza it's such a
crime it'll never be the same at all
a weird combination

[Chorus]
so please heed my warning it's an order from
your tastebuds they know very
well what's good and what's not on a
pizza don't be a fool and listen not
to fake news pineapple does not
belong on a pizza at all

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted the difference we know
what's right and what's wrong in the pizza game
why are we still discuss
pineapple on pizza it's such a
crime it'll never be the same at all
a weird combination

[Bridge]
we want the real deal we
want the authentic
taste of a classic pie
made the way it should
be no fruits allowed
only cheese and sau

[Outro]
can't you see it's just not meant to be
it ruins the flavor
it ruins the vibe it ruins the harmony
of the pizza so let's just agree to disag
ree and keep it far from our
plates keep it far from our sight
pineapple does not belong on
