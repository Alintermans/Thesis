[Intro]
is it insane that pineapple on a

[Verse 1]
pizza's such a crime should be
with pepperoni or sausage
not some fruit that doesn't make
sense on a pie that

[Pre-Chorus]
has cheese and tomato sauce three hundred slices later
you can't deny the truth pineapple doesn't belong on
it's a travesty a culinary abomination
your tastebuds deserve better don't settle for something so

[Chorus]
wrong was it a mistake to put it on top
was it a sin to make our tastebud
turn again is it over now
please stop the insanity and take
it off our plates and give us back our

[Post-Chorus]
sanity our taste

[Verse 2]
pineapple on a pizza
red flag white lies promise
ruins everyone's night blue
mold on old dough your taste

[Bridge]
and did you think we wouldn't notice
the weirdness in your
perversion of a classic treat
at least have some decency
and keep your pineapple far away
from our pizza
only jokes about your bad taste
on social media all
night long but seriously
please stop the madness jumping off a cliff won

[Pre-Chorus]
t convince us that pineapple belongs on a pizza three
hundred arguments later we still won't agree you can't make us
believe that this abomination is something we need it's time
to stop the lies and give us back our dignity and our

[Chorus]
pizza without pineapple was it over
when you ruined the recipe was it a
choice to make our tastebud
cry again is it over now please
allow us to enjoy our food again

[Post-Chorus]
ohoh
is it is it is it
ohoh

deprived of good pizza all thanks
to your strange obsession with
fruit on a pizza oh lord have mer
cy on our taste
only rumors of our dis
gust on social media
all night long but seriously please
stop the insanity and return to the

[Outro]
glory days of pizza
without pineapple flashing lights oh lord give us back our
taste to keep our sanity give us
back our pizza without
pineapple is it is
