[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
pizza is calling me

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
a piece of heaven in front
a fusion of flavors and textures in
each and every single
bite that I take leaves me in
a state of pure bliss and joy beyond compare
why would I ever want to
add pineapple to this masterpiece
and ruin the harmony of flavors
it seems like a crime to

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple has no place
pineapple will never

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the logic in putting
a fruit that's sweet and juicy combined with
savory and spicy and che
all mixed together
throws off the balance of this culinary
masterpiece that we indul
the cheese and the tomato
the sauce and the pepperoni yes
they all work together in harm
but throw pineapple in the
mix and it's chaos and anarchy oh
do we really want

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
do we really want pineapple on our
pizza ruining the
perfect combination
do we really want pineapple on our
pizza making a mess
its pushing its way in

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
do we really want pineapple on our
pizza ruining the
perfect combination
do we really want pineapple on our
pizza making a mess
its pushing its way in
do we really want pineapple on our
pizza taking over
our established her
do we really want pineapple on our
pizza dominating
our established her

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
its attempting to take
its attempting to take
its attempting to take
our pizza away
