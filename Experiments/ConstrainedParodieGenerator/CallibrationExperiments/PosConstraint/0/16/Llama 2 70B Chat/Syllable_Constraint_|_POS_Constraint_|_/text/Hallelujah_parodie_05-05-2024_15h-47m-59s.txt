[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's a crime against humanity
it's like putting ketchup on a
a masterpiece artwork of flav
the cheese and tomato sang in perfect harm

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza

[Verse 2]
they say variety is thespice
of life but some things just don't
mix and match like oil and water don't you
see it's like putting ice in a
a hot cup of coffee it's just not
right and it's not worth the displeasure oh no

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza

[Verse 3]
its called a pizza not a fruit
salad leave the pineapple in
the fruit bowl where it belongs this isn't a
game of culinary twister let's keep
it simple and classic like a
a timeless melody that never goes out

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza

[Verse 4]
I know some will disagree they
think they're being adventurous and
trendy but to me it's just a fad a phase
a confusion of flavors that
clash like cacophony in a
a symphony of culinary master

[Chorus]
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza
oh pineapple on a pizza

[Outro]
oh pineapple please stay away

[Additional Lyrics]
I remember the first time
I had pizza minus the crime
it was heaven on a plate I felt alive
and now you want to take that away oh
oh pineapple why do you have
to rain on my parade with your prickly little

[Additional Lyrics]
every time I order a
pizza I hope and I pray that
there's no sign of you on that pie it's just not
right you're not a topping that I would
ever choose you're more like a bad
habit that I'm trying to break free from oh I

[Additional Lyrics]
why must you ruin all the
fun with your sweetness so over
powering it's like you're trying to be the
only one in the spotlight hogging all
the attention you're not even a
real topping you're just a fruit that doesn't belong
