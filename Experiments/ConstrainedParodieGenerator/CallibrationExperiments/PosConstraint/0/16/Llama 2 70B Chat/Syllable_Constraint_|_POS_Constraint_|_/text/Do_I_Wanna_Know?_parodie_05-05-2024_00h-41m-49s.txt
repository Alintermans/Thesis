[Verse 1]
have you considered the toppings
that should never be on a pizzacrust it sticks out like
a sore thumb like pineapple on a pie
does it really make you wonder
if people have lost their tastebuds in
the sea of mediocrity drowning the flavor
down the drain is where it belongs
like a rejected
an amended what will they think of next pineapple on a
pizza it's such a crime abomination of

[Pre-Chorus]
do they honestly believe pineapple belongs
on a beautiful piece of art like pizza maybe
in they're trying to ruin the reputation
of something so pure with their twisted malicious view

[Chorus]
stop the madness craw
ling back to the drawing board
it starts with an
understanding
why pineapple
should never be on
a pizza never on a
pizza never on
a pizza never

[Verse 2]
so is it deliber
antley poisoning the tastebuds of
the innocent or are they genuinely
unaware of the heinous crime they've committed such a
catastrophe putting pineapple on a pizza like a
virus spreading rapidly infecting every
pizzeria it comes in contact with we must

[Pre-Chorus]
do they honestly believe pineapple belongs
on a beautiful piece of art like pizza maybe
in they're trying to ruin the reputation
of something so pure with their twisted malicious view

[Chorus]
stop the madness crawling back to the start
it begins with respecting
the sanctity of pizza
without the abomination of
pineapple on a pizza never on
a pizza never on a to
pizza never on a to
pizza never on
a pizza never

[Outro]

returning to basics is the only way to be
in harmony with the culinary world once
again please for the love of pizza put an end to
the pineapple on pizza travesty for all time
stop the insanity crawling back is the only
solution to restore order in the world of pizza
