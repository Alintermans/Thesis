And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\npizza is calling me\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nhello there\na piece of heaven in front\na fusion of flavors and textures in\neach and every single\nbite that I take leaves me in\na state of pure bliss and joy beyond compare\nwhy would I ever want to\nadd pineapple to this masterpiece\nand ruin the harmony of flavors\nit seems like a crime to\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\npineapple has no place\npineapple will never\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere is the logic in putting\na fruit that's sweet and juicy combined with\nsavory and spicy and che\nall mixed together\nthrows off the balance of this culinary\nmasterpiece that we indul\nthe cheese and the tomato\nthe sauce and the pepperoni yes\nthey all work together in harm\nbut throw pineapple in the\nmix and it's chaos and anarchy oh\ndo we really want\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndo we really want pineapple on our\npizza ruining the\nperfect combination\n\ndo we really want pineapple on our\npizza making a mess\nits pushing its way in\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndo we really want pineapple on our\npizza ruining the\nperfect combination\n\ndo we really want pineapple on our\npizza making a mess\nits pushing its way in\n\ndo we really want pineapple on our\npizza taking over\nour established her\n\ndo we really want pineapple on our\npizza dominating\nour established her\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nits attempting to take\nits attempting to take\nits attempting to take\n",
