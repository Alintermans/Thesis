[Verse 1]
two times plus twenty minutes
waitin' for my pizza to arrive surely
in this delivery
they said less than half an hour ago
that it'd be here by now the anticipation
of some cheesy delight

[Pre-Chorus]
and so my stomach just growls and growls saying feed
just give me something quick to fill this need
and my mind says forget the rules today living
life for the moment is the way to be free indeed
and my will no longer cares about those cal
or the supposed nutritional facts
its all about

[Chorus]
and I say hey ey e
ah forbid
what is this abomination
and I say hey e ha
oh how dread
what is this combination called

[Verse 2]
and I search
oh I research trying
to comprehend this
outside the window shows
but my mind
oh I reason trying
itself does the scientific
that I desire

[Pre-Chorus]
and so my continues to growl and growl saying
just give me something quick to fill this need
and my mind says forget the rules today living
life for the moment is the way to be free indeed
and my will no longer cares about those cal
or the supposed nutritional facts
its all about

[Chorus]
and I say hayfa e
eh ohah
what is nature's creation
and say hayfa e ha
aha al
what could life be called applying
and my will no longer
stands in the corner or stays behind
life limit
apply this daily revolution
and my will
yourself does question yourself will
or your will questions ones
oneself with this revolutionized
application it
will no longer stands in the corner
nor stay locked
it is partaker it assumes

[Bridge]
o oh
oh

[Outro]
twenty minutes plus two times
twenty minutes plus two times the anticip
of some acid antiqu
