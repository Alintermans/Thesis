[Intro]
I think I think I finally found
a way to keep pizza divine
by keeping pineapple far away
from the toppings that are fine
you agree

[Verse]
I made a grave for pineapple
put it deep down in the ground hide it forevermore from
cuz pineapple on a pizza is
like a crime that never should be forgiven
some put it on their pizza with
no regard for flavor or decency they must be stopped
how could something so sweet and nice offend
but pineapple does not go with cheese and pepperoni it
it's just not right that's not how it
supposed to be that's just not how it's meant to be I made
a grave for pineapple put it deep
down in the ground hide it forevermore from
cuz pineapple on a pizza
is like a crime that never should be forgiven yeah yeah
even satan wouldn't eat pineapple
on a pizza that's just not how it goes even satan wouldn

[Chorus]
in my gravepine
in my gravepine
in my gravepineotot
in my gravepine
in you others my will rot
in you others they

[Outro]
in they others they
in they others my pain
your freedom your freedom
is my pain your freedom you choice
