pineapple topping haters day and night to
long for pepperoni and sausage too taking

smell of cheese and tomato sau
its flavor overpowered by the

[Pre-Chorus]

queuein' for a table turnin
and burnin' their tastebuds at

hidden deep within the menu

[Verse 4]

oh the argument never
ends it goes on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
waitinagers
queuein' for a table turnin
and burnin' their tastebuds at
extinction hop
hidden deep within the menu
items to avoid at all

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
