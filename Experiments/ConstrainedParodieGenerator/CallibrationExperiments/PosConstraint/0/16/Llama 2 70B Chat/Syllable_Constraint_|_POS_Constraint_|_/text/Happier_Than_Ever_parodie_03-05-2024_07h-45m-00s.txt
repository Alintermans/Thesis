[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
my tastebuds start to re
volt they don't understand it
why would you do this to

[Verse 1]
pear and prosciutto yes that's fine go together like
poetry in motion but
pineapple on a pie it
ought to be a crime don't
get me wrong I like a little
sweetness in my life but not on
my savory dish no no
you can keep your tropical fruit to yourself who
needs that much flavor and texture all at
once it's a party in my mouth that I don't want to attend he
re's to classic combos that
never go out of style pe
pperoni and mushroom or sausage and olives they
know their place in the pizza world

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it makes
me want to scream how could you do this to a classic
dish ruining the flavor and the texture it's just not right red
onions and bell peppers that

[Verse 2]
s a spicy combination that
works every time but pineapple
you might as well put ketchup or mustard on
there too why not just stick to what we know
and love instead of trying
to make a tropical vaca
tion out of every bite no
its not a pizza its a

[Verse 3]
fruit salad and I'm not looking to eat a fruit salad
when I order a pie and don't get
me wrong I love fruit but not on my pizza please
stick to the basics cheese and tomato sau
now that's a combination that never
goes out of style so don't try to
reinvent the wheel here just give me what I want and nothing
more no pineapple on my pizza that's just the way
it's gotta be I'm not asking for much just a little
slice of heaven without the tropical fruit

[Outro]
so please I beg of you don
ts put pineapple on my pie
keep it simple keep it real
no pineapple on my pizza that's
the
way it
