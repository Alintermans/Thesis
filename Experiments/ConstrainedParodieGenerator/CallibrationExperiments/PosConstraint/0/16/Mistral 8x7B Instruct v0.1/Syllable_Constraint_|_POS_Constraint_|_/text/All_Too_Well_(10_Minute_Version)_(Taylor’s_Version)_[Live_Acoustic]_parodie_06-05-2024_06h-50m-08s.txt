[Verse 1]
I took a bite and there you were upon that
pizza pie with pineapple on top so bold
but something told me right away it didn't
belong there on that sacred cheesy fold so

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet tanginess and it's sugar shock value
it burned my taste buds with its heated battle
citrusy zing made me question everything that
I once knew to be delicious and righteous

[Pre-Chorus]
and I regret it knowing
it's not what pizza should be
and I tried to forget but it haunts me daily
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause that's not what pizzas are made of forever
they're made with cheese and pepperoni not sour tropical
tomatoes and basil leaves
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
packets of pineapple on countertops I see remain
it stares at me each time I open up my fridge in shamefaced
but it's over now and I've learned my lesson dear lord help me
my beloved pizza that I'll never betray again
or at least try really hard not to anyway no matter
friends enticing me with promises of sweet and
savory delight in every single bite no
they will not win me over to the pineapple side no
not today or any other
doomed day forevermore amen halleluj
ugh icky pineapple on
pizza seriously who does that what's up with you weird
people get it together it's just not right leave it

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know I shoulda known
some things are better left alone
and my tastebuds are still recover
ing from the horror they endured

[Chorus]
'cause that's not how pizzas should be made forevermore
it ain't natural to combine sweet and savory flav
ors like that stop trying
I will always remember it
and no I won't ever partake again no way
hey just put some pineapple in a salad or something
nobody puts pineap
ple on their pizza ever again

[Bridge]
maybe somewhere deep down inside of me
down where my love for pizza
and equally intense hate for pineap
ple on pizza res
ided protected me
from becoming one of those mon
sters who add it to perfectly good pizza willingly who
even are you people and how can you do this to such a
beautiful dish a crime against humanity
that's what pineapple on pizza

[Verse 4]
we can't be friends with pineapple on pizza we
really can't it's just not possible
it slices through our bond like a knife doesn't anyone think of
the children anymore or
do they just not care that they're being exposed
to this abomination early on in life before they even know
how to properly appreciate
a damn good slice of pizza without it
being ruined it
me it ruins it damages beyond be
lievable irreparable harm done to pizza
forever changed never to return to its former glory no
but we carry on making do the best we can without

[Verse 5]
don't give up hope just yet my fellow pizza
lovers there is light at the end of the tunnel it may seem far off
but one day we will live in a world where pineapple
on pizza is but a distant memory a
bad dream that we all had collectively as a
society it won't be easy but we must
fight for what we believe in
for our beloved pizza and its

[Chorus]
pure untarnished form forevermore
nevermore shall pineapple be allowed to grace its
surface no matter how
tempting adding it may seem just
imagine for a minute
a world without pineap
ple on pizza it can
happen just believe in
our beloved pizza
I will always remember it

[Verse 6]
and I remember clearly the first time I tried pineapple
on pizza thinking it was just another
topping option not realizing it would
scar me for life leaving emotional wounds
that may never heal but we carry
on because that's what life demands of us even
when faced with adversity
in the form of fruit on our pizza
but never again let it be
known that pineapple belongs on

[Outro]
just remember it can't be part of our pizza
there's no room for compromise when it comes to pizza
only in our nightmares should pineapple belong on pizza
fight for pizza fight for truth and justice
for all cheese lovers unite we will
claim back our beloved pizza from
its pineapple oppressors forevermore
remember it all too well wind in hair
I was there down the stairs I was there
right behind you fighting for our
beloved pizza it was rare we
remember it all too well wind in hair
I was there down the stairs I was there
right behind you fighting for our
beloved pizza it was rare we
remember it all too well wind in hair
I was there down the stairs I was there
right behind you fighting for our
beloved pizza it was rare we cannot let

[Spoken Outro]
pineapple take over
