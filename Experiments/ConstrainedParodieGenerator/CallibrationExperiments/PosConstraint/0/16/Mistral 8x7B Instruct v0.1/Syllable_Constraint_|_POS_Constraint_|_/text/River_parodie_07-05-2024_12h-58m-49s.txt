[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a denier rejected
pineapple on a pizza
all my taste buds need redemption washed away by sodastream
well little one I won't support it could only bring
disappointment and despair to
confessing now that pineapple just doesn't pair

choked on first bite damn near had a
seizure he can't comprehend the
ordeal his taste buds are going through but wait now
it starts to grow on you can't resist the sweet
meets spicy umami combination

hide the truth from him but now she regrets it because
true love cannot be built on lies and pineapple upon a
pizza is a recipe for disaster
call maintenance as she orders a new
pizza removing the pineapple
can't bear to see the look of disappointment
on his face again and again and hopes
maybe just maybe he
can forgive her for her mistake again and
again and again and again and again and again and
