And is it over now?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWh\u0435n you lost control (Uh-huh)\nRed blood, white snow (Uh-huh)\nBlue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)\nYour new girl is my clone\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd did you think I didn't see you?\nThere were flashin' lights\nAt least I had the decency\nTo keep my nights out of sight\nOnly rumors 'bout my hips and thighs\nAnd my whispered sighs\nOh, Lord, I think about jumpin'\nOff of very tall somethings\nJust to see you come runnin'\nAnd say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)\nIf she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)\nYou dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)\nYou search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it over when she laid down on your couch?\nWas it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?\n\"Come here,\" I whispered in your ear\nIn your dream as you passed out, baby\nWas it over then?
