[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
craving pineapple won't cause me any harm
but why on a pizza it just doesn't fit right in the
scheme of things it's causing me alarmly dismay
now I sit down and order a slice of my own
with ham and tomato and no fruit to be shown
then they bring out the offender and my stomach
churns as I start to from

[Pre-Chorus]
but they bite into the pie
my appetite dies we
shall not ab
sorb this monstrosity into our
belly tonight it

[Chorus]
intolerance bubbling up inside
shame on this culinary
crimescene it's time to take
a stand against pineapple
determination calling
let's open up our minds
and ban pineapple

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine cr
aving pineapple is quite divine but on a
pizza it's a sin the taste is a pity the texture
it gets too soggy oh why did they even start
never again will I order a slice with the
forbidden fruit on top I'll stick to pepper and
mushroom and my stomach will not be sickened and
it's finally all in

[Pre-Chorus]
but their adding pineapple
my willpower though it
may falter
because who really enjoys how does
it even matter

[Chorus]
intolerance bubbling up inside
shame on this culinary
crimescene it's time to take
a stand against pineapple
determination calling
let's open up our minds
and ban pineapple

[Guitar Solo]


[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never
