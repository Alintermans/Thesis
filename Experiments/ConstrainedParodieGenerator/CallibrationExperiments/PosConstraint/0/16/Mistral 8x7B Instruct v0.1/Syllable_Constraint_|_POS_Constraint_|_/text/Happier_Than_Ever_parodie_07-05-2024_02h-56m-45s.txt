[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
my tastebuds scream in
wish I could express it clearer
this abomination

[Verse 1]
let me ponder on it for a while until I find
a valid reason to rec
this fungus on my pizza
did you see my reactions
or ignore my expressed distaste
when you claimed it tastes amazing
don't you think it's kinda
it's just not appetizing you see now it's me
ending up more disgusted than before
it's not fair to force it on me like this saying it's a trendy dish
so if you really wanna
be a decent human been
it's gotta be without the pineapple on top please
when I asked you politely to

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza alone itself
my tastebuds scream in protestation strong as they
wish it wasn't true it's such a travesty it's hard to explain
my willpower weakening

[Verse 2]
you sip your drink with pineapple in
actin' like it's part of tradition
you claim I'm way too uptight regarding food
at least I ain't deluded thinking
it belongs on pizza you
it looks quite horrendous to me
on my valued pizza sacred
your pineapple obsession

[Verse 3]
and I hold my tongue on social media about this
too polite to state the obvious truth
that there'll never be a place for pineapple
but every time it surfaces feeling
upward rising bile compelling me to
and talk about each slice ingested
my repeated reasoning without a convincing case for
but my words are all dismissed leaving me dejected
how do you not understand it's just plain wrong I ask you
time and again to comprehend my point of

[Outro]
it trashes flavour balance
spoilin' my ordered slice replacing
can't you practice some restr
not insisting on adding pineapple
