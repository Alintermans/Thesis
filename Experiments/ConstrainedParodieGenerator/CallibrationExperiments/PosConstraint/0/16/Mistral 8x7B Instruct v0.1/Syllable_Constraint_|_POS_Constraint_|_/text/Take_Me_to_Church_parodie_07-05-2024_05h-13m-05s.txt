[Verse 1]
my palate's gotta
hate for pineapple on a pizza
knew it'd ruin the flavor blo
it shouldn't be on pizza dough
if the topings ever made me
gag and want to spit it
one bite's enough to make me fle
another terrible
we indulged thinking different tastes
but pineapple does not belong
my hatred for it rings true loudest
when I'm eating pizza alone is
where my tastebuds come to
heed this warning and avoid that
can of pineapple tid

[Pre-Chorus]
a pity
itty bitty

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza slice and holy grail of taste so
I won't weep and you won't see regret you
should've heeded me before
keep pineapple off my pizza slice
let me enjoy
my beloved pepperoni and mozzarella
I won't weep I won't regret rejecting
canadian bacon and
pineapple duet no more take me

[Verse 2]
if I believe the gods above all
they'd never allow pine
on a perfect slice of pizza
it'd be cheesy goodness
doing the ritual sacrifice
burning that can of pineapple
this can't be part of the
italian tradition of
my beloved pizza creation
no sacred deliciousness in
this ingredient

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza slice and holy grail of taste so
I won't weep and you won't see regret you
shouldhave heeded me before
keep pineapple off my pizza slice
let me enjoy
my beloved pepperoni and mozzarella
I won't weep I won't regret rejecting
canadian bacon and
pineapple duet no more take me

[Bridge]
no kitchens or cooks when a ritual begins
the only sweeter innocence is without pineapple
on a bed of cheese within the sacred scene un
only then my tastebuds free once again I am

[Pre-Chorus]
a pity it
itty bitty

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza slice and holy grail of taste so
I won't weep and you won't see regret you
should've heeded me before
keep pineapple off my pizza slice
let me enjoy
my beloved pepperoni and mozzarella
I won't weep I won't regret rejecting
canadian bacon and
pineapple duet no more take me
