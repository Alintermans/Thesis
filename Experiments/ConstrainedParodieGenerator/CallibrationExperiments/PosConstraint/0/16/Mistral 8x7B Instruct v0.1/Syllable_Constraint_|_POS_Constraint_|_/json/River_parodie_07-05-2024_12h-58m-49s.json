He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a denier rejected\npineapple on a pizza\nall my taste buds need redemption washed away by sodastream\nwell little one I won't support it could only bring\ndisappointment and despair to\nconfessing now that pineapple just doesn't pair\nwell with the taste of tom\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe ordered pepperoni but got pineap\nchoked on first bite damn near had a\nseizure he can't comprehend the\nordeal his taste buds are going through but wait now\nit starts to grow on you can't resist the sweet\nmeets spicy umami combination\nbut fear not there's a solution go for ham and pineap\njust not acidic tomatoes it'll ruin the sensation sighed\nin disapproval said it\nruined his dinner but can't resist the temptation\nbut he thinks putting pineapple on a pizza\ntarnished his reputation claimed he'll never partake in\nthat sacrilegious act again\ncalled it a sinful abomination but keeps on\ncraving for a slice again and again and again and again\nguaranteed gains and his willpower remained\nin vain and succumbed to the temptation\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a denier rejected\npineapple on a pizza\nall my taste buds need redemption faded away by sodast\nream unable to accept that pineapple just doesn't\npair well with taste of tomato\nconfessing now that pineapple just doesn't pair\nwell with the taste of tom\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nsome first dates turned a second date seeing\nhis shocked expression upon sight of pineapple\nshe thought he'd appreciate the surprise but\nafter the first bite she realizes her\nmistake he can't hide his disgust now she feels bet\nrayed and used what's she supposed to do now it's hard to\nsay how can she tell him that she's used pineapple gotta\nfind the words she's aloof nervous sally so she reverts to text message\nnevermore face to face she just can't bring herself to admit it\ncouldn't handle the taste decided to\nhide the truth from him but now she regrets it because\ntrue love cannot be built on lies and pineapple upon a\npizza is a recipe for disaster\ncall maintenance as she orders a new\npizza removing the pineapple\ncan't bear to see the look of disappointment\non his face again and again and hopes\nmaybe just maybe he\ncan forgive her for her mistake again and\nagain and again and again and again and again and\ngu\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nI'm sorry for the pine\nsorry\ncall\npineapple\nwas a grave mistake we\nlet the river run calls me sorri\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nperpetually the villain never\naccept beloved pineapple on pizza\nfuck what can I say if pizza was a highway and pine\npeople like me were drivers in our own lane we\nthese sacred so called sacred established\nrules of pizza consumption\nspeeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on\nice oh wait maybe that's the reason why I can\nnever accept pineapple on pizza it\nchanges ices the flavor profile\ncalls it a sinful abomination but\nmy hatred for pineapple upon pizza\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI'm sorry for rejecting pine\non a pizza trying to\naccept it confessing now that pineapple does not pair with\ntogether good\nmy beloved\n\nmy named not associated with pine\nits ruined\n\nfor the parody follows the\nsyllable structure and rhyme scheme closely staying\n",
