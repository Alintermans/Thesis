[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've read recipes online
the savory and the
toppings that align fam
marinara and the
pepperoni to
cheese that stretches long and
but a pineapple on pizza's where I draw the line

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she asked yeah she persisted
when I resisted said
I'm not hankering for someone
that a pineapple requests
some weirdobsession
some exotic fest
just something we agree on
something our beloved
its got to be the best no

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
parmesan coated
oh I want something just
crust golden baked perfection not
doo didn't do something
ruin appetence
oh I want something just
cold pineapple won't ever
it will never ever be

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I examined cooking books
the history of the
crust hand tossed became a
tradition people took
or chicagoans slice
a thick with tomatoes
and me oh how I wish for none with pineap

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she asked yeah she persisted
even when resisted
my heated denial could not
outside the usual dwell
no citrus permiss
no tropical spell
so look no further agreed
deliverdifferment

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something so unlike
your tired options here at

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh we demand something just like
hold tight to tradition
yeah we want something
oh I want something just
pineapple ain't an option
please obey convention
uh forgetabout
dear captain ration please

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
so darling where you
long live our pizza
it shouldn'ta ever needed for
as a legitimate base
no fruit absurdness
this particular
so hand me plain perfection
none my ordered stated
me loving delivery

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh we do adore something just
pure unadulterated joy
oh we must order always like
