[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I spite you, I spite you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
desist there
the critter atop my square
the unwelcome guest on my pizza slice
the unanticipated
peril in my kitchen a
we can't abide if we don't want
that bitter taste to linger
and pineapple won't jingle like
a christmas delight tonight it won't
heed this advice tonight

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I spite you I spite you
I spite you I spite you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where'd you come from bringing such mal
I strive yet am unable to slumber
I plead absolution and yet
anxiety pers
uils stalk with ickyness lingering all ab
and as I glare I counted
each triangle of a slice
covered in pineapple's stickiness
with hesitation to confront
and try to scrape it all off
can't trust pizza anymore tonight
can no longer trust

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't serve it to me I won't even
bother taking a bite
I complain I complain
keep pineapple off my pizza tonight it
won't be served tonight
I complain I complain

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
keep pineapple off my pizza tonight it
won't be served tonight
I complain I complain
keep pineapple off my pizza tonight it
won't be served tonight
I complain I complain
keep pineapple off my pizza tonight it
won't be served tonight
I complain I complain
keep pineapple off my pizza tonight it
won't be served tonight
I complain I complain

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I spite you I spite you
I spite your pineapple
I spite your pineapple
I spite your pineapple
