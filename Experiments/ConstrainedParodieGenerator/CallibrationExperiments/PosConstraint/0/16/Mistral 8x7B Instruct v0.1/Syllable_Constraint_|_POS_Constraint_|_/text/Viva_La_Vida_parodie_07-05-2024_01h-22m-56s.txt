[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice crushed
now I wake up to a different
truth that's far from heaven sent

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I savored every
bite of sweet and savory delight
thought it tasted rather fine
now I'd never waste my time dining this
way again my friend no sir
pineapple on a pizza
is a culinary sin I can't
abide by and truth be told I never will

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
hear ham and cheese a calling loud and clear
pizza devotees share knowing sne
er when they hear of pineapple
they yearn for a classic marinara
for some peculiar reason I can
fully comprehend leaving
pineapple behind when
I take a bite of pizza pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it started with a silly trend
time to put it to a bitter
end revolutionaries wait no
more for pineapple topped pizza I say
put an end to this abom
ination once and for all aw
how could anyone in their right culina
ry mind find this combination right

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
hear ham and cheese a calling loud and clear
listeners judge with educated
ears when they hear of pineapple
they yearn for a classic marinara
for some compellingly good reason
I can't partake in this deception
nevermore another
bite of pineapple pizza pie

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohhoho ohhoho
enough is enough said
banish pineapple from
thy pizza forever

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
step away from the pine
apples christopher do kindly refr
edit from eating said
culpritary delectable des
ruction our trusted
pizza pie deserves much better
consortia my beloved
ham and mozzarella and tomato
join my crusadeded
peration to restore true pizza
love and make the world a
better place without pineapple pizza
nevermore another
bite of pineapple pizza pie

[Outro]
ahoy friend o
f mine come join
me in
