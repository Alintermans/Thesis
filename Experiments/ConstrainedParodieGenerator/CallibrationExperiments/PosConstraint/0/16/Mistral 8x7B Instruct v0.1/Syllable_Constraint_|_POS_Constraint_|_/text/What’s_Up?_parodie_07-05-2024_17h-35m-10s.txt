[Verse 1]
two slices tried and my ver
dict is clear avoiding that heresy of
pineapple on pizza
for a concoction so vile and absurd
I realized quickly once I took that first bite of that
abomination on

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I shiver sometimes just thinking about
that mix of sweet and savory clashing
and I heave with disgust every single bite
for I scream from the depths of my soul questioning how
such a thing could exist at all in this world
and I say at the table amid
my embarrassed

[Chorus]
hey what were you thinking
putting pine
apple on pizza you monster
hey what were you drinking
strawberry
daiquiris while eating pizza

[Bridge]
oh no
oh
hell no way
repeat
ad
finitec

[Verse 2]
and I vent
oh my god is this a
joke are you kidding
about that accursed
creation
and I yearn endlessly
for a world free of pineapple
offenses against

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I tremble sometimes just thinking about
that mix of sweet and savory clashing
and I heave with disgust every single bite
for I scream from the depths of my soul questioning how
such a thing could exist at all in this world
and I repeat at every fe
ast I attend

[Chorus]
hey what were you thinking
putting pine
apple on pizza you fi
endish villain trying
to ruin
our sacred doughballs our
salvation we needed
marinara by our side and
cheese abund
ant all over pizza but your med
dling with fruit
hey what's going on in that head
or your missing logic
try onions or peppers instead of
delightful pineap
ples on your pizza next time think twice
and you will
see the beauty of a pizza

[Bridge]
oh no
oh
hello no

[Outro]
two slices tried and my ver
dict is clear avoiding that heresy of
pineapple on pizza please
