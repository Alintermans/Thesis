[Verse 1]
shun pineapple with all your
might before taking a bite and
she'll scoff at your pizza choice claiming take
out's the only way to go with

[Pre-Chorus]
oh nope say it ain't so pine
awful on pizza take it slow
disappear forevermore pine
stay away from my slice

[Chorus]
with pineapple it's more dangerous
here it is now making me we
t's gross and utterly outrage
here it is now doing me wrong
a prickly fruit ruins the mood
a pizza abomination

[Post-Chorus]
no way man

[Verse 2]
its slimy texture ruins
the cheesy experience
it doesn't belong on pizza done
enough already put it on

[Pre-Chorus]
oh nope say it ain't so pine
awful on pizza take it slow
disappear forevermore pine
stay away from my slice

[Chorus]
with pineapple it's more dangerous
here it is now making me we
t's gross and utterly outrage
here it is now doing me wrong
a prickly fruit ruins the mood
a pizza abomination

[Post-Chorus]
no way man

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I cannot even fathom
why anyone would want it there
it adds nothing to the flavor
oh well whatever just compare

[Pre-Chorus]
oh nope say it ain't so pine
awful on pizza take it slow
disappear forevermore pine
stay away from my slice

[Chorus]
with pineapple it's more dangerous
here it is now making me we
t's gross and utterly outrage
here it is now doing me wrong
a prickly fruit ruins the mood
a pizza abomination

[Outro]
a catastrophe a fail oh
a denial an abortion
a travesty another fall
oh pineapples wherever you
are stay away
