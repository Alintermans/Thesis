[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple does not belong on a dish
it's got no place on a pizza
this abomination without
a pizzazenza if you will

[Verse 2]
second things second
do not try to sell me your sweet deceptional
pineapple on pizza
is a culinary sin beyond
all perception of what flavors

[Pre-Chorus]
were raised eating margherita
finding it tacky and a pity
adding it to a pizza pie
no thank you we'd rather say goodbye away it goes
can't believe that some people
do not see the error of their
ways it's time to put an end to
pineapple on pizza days for

[Chorus]
ay caramba leave my pizza plain
ain't nobody got
time for pineapple on pizza days
oh no not again please
spare everyone the anguish and stay away
you've got no business being on a
snack whose sacred space you cannot inv
ade create today folks

[Verse 3]
third things third
say no to pineapple every
time it's suggested on
top of your tomato sauce no way ain
t nobody gonna eat that

[Pre-Chorus]
we got offered a slice that
made us question why it exists
can't believe we even have
been forced to discuss this topic
but it's time to take a stand and say no way jose
get that pineapple off my plate and get it away from me
its giving me

[Chorus]
ay caramba leave my pizza plain
ain't nobody got
time for pineapple on pizza days
oh no not again please
spare everyone the anguish and stay away
you've got no business being on a
snack whose sacred space you cannot inv
ade create today folks

[Verse 4]
last things last
before we part our separate ways
pineapple has no business
on a pizza in any
way shape or form period

[Pre-Chorus]
and that's the final word on this matter lets move on
leave the pineapple for your fruit salad or smoothies only
your pizza should

[Chorus]
ay caramba leave my pizza plain
ain't nobody got
time for pineapple on pizza days
oh no not again please
spare everyone the anguish and stay away
you've got no business being on a
snack whose sacred space you cannot inv
ade create today folks
