[Verse 1]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
replace it with some pepper
your tastebuds will remember
that sweet and savory clash ain't worth the fight
your tongue will thank you later
it's a flavor disaster

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tried this before with ham and pine
why do it again making pizza crime
the slimy chunks remain
we've tried it all before still causing
pizza pain with pine on the plain again
no explanationain

[Chorus]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
give it a rest for once and for
give it a rest for once and for
just say goodbye to that pineapple fright
your pizza will thank you for sure
give it a rest for once and for

[Verse 2]
just drop that pineapple off your pizza slice
add some mushrooms or sausage
toppings make it extra nice
reminders of failed experiments past
your satisfied tastebud
now forever truly blessed

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tried this before with ham and pine
why do it again making pizza crime
the slimy chunks remain
we've tried it all before still causing
pizza pain with pine on the plain again
no explanationain

[Chorus]
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
your pizza will thank you for sure
your satisfied tastebuds will
just drop that pineapple off your pie tonight
your satisfied tastebuds will
your appreciated pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tried this before with ham and pine
why do it again making pizza crime
the slimy chunks remain
we've tried it all before still causing
pizza pain with pine on the plain again
no explanationain
