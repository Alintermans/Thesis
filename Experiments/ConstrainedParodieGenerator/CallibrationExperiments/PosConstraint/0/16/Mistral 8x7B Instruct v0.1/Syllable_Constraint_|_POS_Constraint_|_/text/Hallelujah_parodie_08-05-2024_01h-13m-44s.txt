[Verse 1]
now I've heard there's an awful pizza
topped with pineapple and sausage is
but you don't really fancy that combo do
you ain't got no taste in food
it's just so weird and misunder
stood the power of pineapple abuse du

[Chorus]
pineapple ruin pizza night
pineapple ruin pizza night

[Verse 2]
you order deep dish with delight pling
but the taste of pineapple makes
you start to feel something's not quite right oh yeah
it looks like a mess upon your
plate the sweet fruit and tomato sauce
make you wanna spit it out tonight oh yeah

[Chorus]
pineapple ruin pizza night
pineapple ruin pizza night

[Verse 3]
I don't get why people say
pineapple belongs on pizza
when it just ruins the whole thing am I right
the texture's odd and flavor's all wrong
it does not sound like it belongs
on pizza but some still perpetuate this

[Chorus]
pineapple ruin pizza night
pineapple ruin pizza night

[Verse 4]
it can't be true that people
think pineapple's tasty on pizza
what goes on in their minds makes no sense to me
but even if they like the taste
it doesn't mean that everyone
should eat it on their pizza please believe me

[Chorus]
pineapple ruin pizza night
pineapple ruin pizza night
pineapple ruin pizza night
pineapple ruin piano
p I n e a p p le
r u I n p I zza night
please oh please no more pineapple
tonight oh tonight tomorrow
cold remains a broken pizza

[Outro]
stay away from pineapple on

[Additional Lyrics]
don't put pineapple on
my pizza any more I beg
your adding toppings do not belong my friend
but if you do it anyway at least
warn me in advance so I can
run away and get some proper pizza instead

[Additional Lyrics]
no matter what people say or
do I'll always hate pineapple
on pizza it's just not meant to be my friend
but let them have it if they want it
all I know is that I won't
eat it on my pizza ever again amen

[Additional Lyrics]
even if there is a god
and he loves pineapple on his
pie it does not mean I have to like it too
or I should ever eat it on my slice
it'll always be a broken pie
for those who put pineapple on their pizza true
