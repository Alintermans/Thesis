[Intro]
should pineapple belong on a pizza

[Verse 1]
first the savory begins
with the cheese and tomato base
but then the sweetness intrudes
ruining the meal

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later at the
table filled with disappointment and regret wishing for a
cheese pizza instead of this monstrosity with pineapple
you bite and chew but the taste doesn't improve due to the pineap

[Chorus]
was it tasty when it appeared on the pie
will it be better when it comes time to say
goodbye to the pineapple on
your pizza slice by slice throwing it
away saying never again will I let

[Post-Chorus]
should pineapple belong

[Verse 2]
chef sheds a tear knowingly
hot flames unable to
prevent disaster in the
oven with pineapple

[Bridge]
and did you think it appropriate
an insult to the
traditional italian dish
only rumors about the
pizza toppings with pine apple and
ham oh lord why did
they even bother making it
with pineapple just to see
how many people they could
disappoint with this culinary mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred dining disasters later
if it's on the menu I won't even bother I'll just order a
margherita instead of this disaster with pineapple says
my ordered pizza is better off without pineapple on top

[Chorus]
will it be tasty when presented on the
pie will it be better when it comes time to
push it away saying never
again will I let pineapple near
my pizza slice by slice throwing it out now

[Post-Chorus]
should pine
apple belong on a
pizza
should pineapple

[Bridge]
knowing your putting pine
apple on pizza
without much consideration
for the traditional taste
now nobody wants to order or
make pizza with pine
apple ruining it for the
rest of us who enjoy a
well made pizza without any fruit
or sweeteners that don't belong on a

[Outro]
fastforward to today
can't believe people still order pizza with pineapple
lets just stick to the traditional to
ppings and forget about pine
apple on a pizza
never
should pineapple belonging on a pizza is
