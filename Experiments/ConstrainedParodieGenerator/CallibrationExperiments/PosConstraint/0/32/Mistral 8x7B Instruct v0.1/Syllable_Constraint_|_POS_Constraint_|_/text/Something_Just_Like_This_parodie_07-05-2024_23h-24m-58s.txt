[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni and cheese
but pineapple just won
through reputation
it doesn't deserve to
be on a pizza pie like this one does belong here

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said taste is subjective
and I can't deny
I'm not looking for a topping
that will make me wonderwhy
it's on my pizza
underneath the cheese
just something I can bite
into without any
unpleasant surprise release

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
this cheesy parad
I want something just like
this tomato sauce delightful
dish I can't resist
I want something just
like this pizza without
pineapple on it I insist
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
but sweet and savory
should never be conflate
pineapple belongs in
a fruit salad plate at
most but not defiling a pizza like this

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
they said try it you might like it
but I don't wanna
I'm not looking for a flavor
that will make me questionna
why people think it
belongs on pizza
just something I can savor
without any regret

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doot doot doot doot doot do
doot doot doot doot do
doot doot doot doot doot do
oh I want something just like this
doot doot doot doot doot do
doot doot doot doot do
doot doot doot doot doot do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a topping
that will make me reminis
ce about pineap
please just dismiss it
just something I can turn to
something I can
enjoy without a single

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this oh
I want something just like this oh
I want something just like this oh
