[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I realized quickly when I took a bite
that pineapple's a culprit that just doesn't fit right
for the taste that I ate

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just thinking of the taste that I once led
and I'm feeling a little peculiaristic
and so I wake in the morning and I open wide
and I take a deep breath and I swallow with
and I spit from the top of my
mouth saying oh

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on with
my pizza pie today
and I say
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

[Bridge]
ooh
o
ooh uh u
ooh o
o
ooh uh u

[Verse 2]
and I tried
my goodness did I tried
I tried every
at the pizzer
and I cried
my goodness did I cried
I cried every single day
for reformation

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just thinking of the taste that I once led
and I'm feeling a little peculiaristic
and so I wake in the morning and I open wide
and I take a deep breath and I swallow with
and I spit from the top of my mouth
saying oh no

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey hey hey
I said hey what's going on
with my pizza pie hey
and I say
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
and I say hey hey hey
wake in the morning and open wide
take a deep
and I spit from the top of my mouth
saying oh
and I say hey hey hey hey hey
wake in the morning and
take a deep breath and I swallow with
saying oh no way
and I say hey hey hey hey hey hey
pineapple
should never be on a pizza

[Bridge]
ooh o
o
ooh uh u

[Outro]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate fare
