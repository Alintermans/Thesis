[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go ical error
everyone's a hater knowin
it's a sin to put pineapple
on a pizza soon as it's
baked it's a mistake ain
no savin' this monstrosity we
were born sick of this trend
I won't conform to this abom
ination a pizza should be
sacrilege I won't
tolerate this sinful creation
is not a valid topping
I was born sick but I
won't stand for this

[Pre-Chorus]
a pity
pity pity

[Chorus]
take me back in
time before this trend began I'll never worship
pineapple on pizza lies I won't believe
offer me a real pizza
oh good god let me have my life back
take me back in
time before this trend began I'll never worship
pineapple on pizza lies I won't believe
offer me a real pizza
oh good god let me have my life back

[Verse 2]
if I'm a lover of the old ways
pineapple's the intrud
er ruining the taste for me
it demands a removal
drain the whole pizza get a topping
that won't offend my taste bud
that's a fine lookin' classic
what you got on your slice now
we've a lot of picky eaters
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hungry work

[Chorus]
take me back in
time before this trend began I'll never worship
pineapple on pizza lies I won't believe
offer me a real pizza
oh good god let me have my life back
take me back in
time before this trend began I'll never worship
pineapple on pizza lies I won't believe
offer me a real pizza
oh good god let me have my life back

[Bridge]
no masters or kings when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
in the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh pity
pity pity

[Chorus]
take me back in
time before this trend began I'll never worship
pineapple on pizza lies I won't believe
offer me a real pizza
oh good god let me have my life back
take me back in
time before this trend began I'll never worship
pineapple on pizza lies I won't believe
offer me a real pizza
oh good god let me have my life back
