He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine time and time\nall my sins need some truth serum feeling it work its primetime\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with a slice of pineapple\non his pizza plate causing a\nsweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched on\nhis breath's the smell of pineapple making him un\nraveled at the thought of pineapple on pizza\nit's a travesty he just can't\nfathom the thought of pineapple on pizza it's a mess\nactually just spit on his pizza and he'll confess he hates\nthe taste of pineapple on\npizza it's a disgrace to the pizza's grace and he can\nsee it on your face that you don't share the same\ntaste in pizza so he'll say no to pineapple on his\nplate and he'll take the pineapple\noff and throw it away before he takes a bite and\nprays that you'll understand that pineapple on pizza is a sin\nhi haters but he'll say bye pineapple\non pizza tonight he's gonna win this\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine time and time\nall my sins need some truth serum feeling it work its primetime\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is pain\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na pizza night turned a disaster when\npineapple was added it was a disaster\nit was a no go but he ate it any\nway it was a mistake he regrets it now\nhe can't believe he ate the pineapple on his\npizza it was a bad idea but he tried it\nanyway now he's paying for it with a stomach a\nche and he's wondering how to tell this girl that he's through with pineapple\non pizza but how can he say it in a way that won't hurt her\nfeelings he knows she loves pineapple on\npizza but he can't stand the thought of it so he\navoids it at all costs and orders his pizza without pine\napple he knows it's for the best but he can\nt help but feel like he's\nmissing out on something good but he\nknows the truth about pineapple on pizza and\nhe's not gonna let it ruin his love\nfor pizza anymore\nhe's not gonna let pineapple on pizza\ncontrol his life anymore he's gonna take control and say\nno\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's no pineapple\nmy name\n'sal\npizza run\ncall me no pineapple\nwe'll let the pizza run without pine\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the enemy of pineapple\non pizza never a fan of the com\nbination of pineapple and pizza it's a sinful\ncombination that should never be on a pizza\nit's a disgrace to the pizza gods he\ncan't believe he ever\nthought it was a good idea to put\npineapple on pizza it's a mistake that he\nmade and he's sorry for it but he knows that\npizza is better without pineap\nple on it so he'll never make that mistake\nagain he'll stick to the classic toppings and\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fine time and time\nall my sins need some truth serum feeling it work its primetime\nwell little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\n's gonna cause is pain the truth and\nmy lies now are falling like the rain so let the\n",
