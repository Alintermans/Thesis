[Verse 1]
just a small town slice' in a cheesy
world it's been adulterated with pineap
just a classic pie born and raised in italy
should stick to its roots without any frilly

[Verse 2]
a chef in a steamy kitchen
the smell of dough and marin
for a taste they can share the night
it goes against tradition in black

[Pre-Chorus]
diners
arguing up and down the
pizzeria their shadows search
disgrace
twistin' tradition just to find
an excuse to add ham in

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to make it right
everybody wants a bite
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more slice

[Verse 4]
some will win some will lose
some are born to sing the blues
oh the dish is ruined it
goes against the rules and boos in the

[Pre-Chorus]
diners
arguing up and down the
pizzeria their shadows search
disgrace
twistin' tradition just to find
an excuse to add ham in

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hatin' it
throw that slice away and
disgrace people
don't stop hatin' it
throw it
disgrace people
don't stop hatin' it
throw that slice away and
disgrace people
