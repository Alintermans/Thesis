[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottles in hand looking so divine start
it started out with a slice now my stomach is in a
wad of regret and disappointment in my heart
now I'm lying awake and my stomach's in a
tizzy as I think of pineapple on pizza
it's a travesty and it's just not right or fair
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savoring the taste
while I'm stuck in my ways
let me be
for I cannot bear to see it on a
pizza pie and it

[Chorus]
sparks controversy and turns friends into
frenemies swimming through a
minefield of opinions but
it's just the price we pay for
freedom of choice calling me
open up my curious
eyes for I am not

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine must
ard to accept that some people have different
tastes but I still can't understand why they'd ruin a
good pizza with a fruit that doesn't belong there
now I'm lying awake and my stomach's in a
knot as I think of pineapple on pizza it
should be a crime and it's just not right or fair and
it's all in my head oh

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savoring the taste
while I'm stuck in my ways
let me be
for I cannot bear to see it on
a pizza pie and

[Chorus]
sparks controversy and turns friends into
frenemies swimming through a
minefield of opinions but
it's just the price we pay for
freedom of choice calling me
open up my curious
eyes for I am not

[Guitar Solo]


[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never
