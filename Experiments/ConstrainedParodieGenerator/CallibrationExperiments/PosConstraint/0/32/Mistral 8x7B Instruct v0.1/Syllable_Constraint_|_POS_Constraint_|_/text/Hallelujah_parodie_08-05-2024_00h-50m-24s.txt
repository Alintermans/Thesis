[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc

the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the baffling sight of pineapple shows

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no no no no

[Verse 2]
your taste was fine but you needed proof
this combo's not a truth or proof

pineapple no no no no no

[Outro]
pineapple no no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]

and remember when I tried it once it
was a mistake that I regret it
it's just pineapple on top of a pizza that
