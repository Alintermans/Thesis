[Intro]
I think I've tried and tried again now
to find a way to justify
the topping choice I hate with passion
I guess that's the first step right
you agree

[Verse]
I've tasted pine on pizza pie
can't pretend it's something I enjoy or recommend
oh man what a mess the taste it leaves
if I could change it I would not pretend it
some serve pine on pizza wide and
I'd have thought you'd know it's just a crime against the dish so
I'll pass on pine on pizza night and day
and I don't wanna taste it again so in my mouth it
won't stay I've tasted pine on
pizza pie can't pretend it's something I'd desire
oh man what a mess the taste it leaves
if I could change it I would not pretend it
some serve pine on pizza wide and
I'd have thought you'd know it's just a crime against the dish so
I'll pass on pine on pizza night and day
and I don't wanna taste it again so in my mouth it

[Chorus]
in my mouth it won
t stay in my mouth
it won't stay in my mouth
in my mouth it won
t stay in my mouth it won
t stay in my mouth

[Outro]
in my mouth it won
t stay in my mouth it
won't stay in my mouth
is my taste your pleasure is all
of this
