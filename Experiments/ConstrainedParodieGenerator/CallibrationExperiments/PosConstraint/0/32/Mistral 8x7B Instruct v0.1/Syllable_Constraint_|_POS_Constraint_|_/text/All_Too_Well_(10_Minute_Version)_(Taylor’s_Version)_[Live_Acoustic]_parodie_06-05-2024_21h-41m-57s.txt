[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I left my appetite at the table
that monstrosity should not be allowed now

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet deception and my gullible frown
we bit into the pie with smiles falling down
pineapple chunks sliding like a frown turned upside
and I can't help but regret it after

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's a mistake
but I took another bite
and I can't believe I fell for it again
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on my plate so plain
a mix of sweet and savory driving me insane wind in
my hair I was there I reg
ret it all too well now ribly

[Verse 3]
condiments scattered on the counter in a messy heap
you said it was a delicacy people can't forget I said
let's give it a try and see how it goes but now I know it
was a big mistake and I'm never gonna do it
again and then you wondered why I looked so ill I said it
tastes like failure and you held my plate with regret
and I could see it in your eyes you knew it was a
mistake but you ate it all the same now I regret it
all too well yeah I regret it
all too well yeah I regret it all too well
now I regret it all too
well yeah I regret it all too well yeah I regret it
all too well yeah I regret it all too well yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's a mistake
but I took another bite and
I can't believe I fell for it ag
ain oh oh oh I regret it

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on my plate so plain a
mix of sweet and savory driving me insane wind in mi
hair I was there I reg
ret it all too well now ribly
and there it was again when nobody was around
we ate it in secret thinking no one would ever know
but now I'm sharing it
with everyone and I regret it

[Bridge]
well maybe we got carried away with
the toppings on the pizza
but I couldn't stop myself from eating
it all up running
scared I was there I reg
ret it all too well now yeah yeah
and you said it was a mistake to add pineapple on top
but I couldn't resist the temptation and now I regret
it all too well yeah I regret it all too well
now I regret it all too well

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm
in a new hell every time I think
of that monstrosity I can't believe I fell for it I said
it was a mistake but you
convinced me to give it a try and now it
haunts me every time I close my eyes I regret it all too well yeah
I regret it all too well yeah and
I can't believe I let you talk me
into it all too
well yeah I regret it all too well now yeah
I regret it all too well yeah I regret it
all too well yeah I regret it all too well yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
and I regret it all too well yeah I regret it all

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to forget that night but I'm still trying to find it after
the taste of pineapple lingers on my tongue and it
reminds me of the mistake I made that night and
I wish I could take it back but I can't so
I'll just have to live with it and I regret it all
too well yeah I regret it
all too well yeah I regret it all

[Chorus]
cause there it was again on my plate so
plain a mix of sweet and savory driving me in
sane wind In my hair I
was there I reg regret it all
too well now yeah I regret
it all too well yeah and
there it was again when
I thought I was being
so adventurous but
now I know it was a mistake

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at trying new things but the outcome
was a disaster I'm never gonna do
it again and did the pineapple chunks
destroy the pizza for you too was it a
mistake to add it on top of the
cheese and sauce and now I regret it all too well
yeah I regret it all too
well and I can't believe I let you
talk me into it all too well
now I regret it all too well

[Outro]
I regret it all too well yeah I regret it all too
well and I regret it all too well yeah I regret
it all too well yeah I regret it all too well yeah yeah yeah yeah
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all too well
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair I was there I was there
