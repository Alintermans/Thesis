[Intro]
is this a bad pie coming from pure deceit
pineapple on pizza making us all take a seat
look at this monstrosity served upon your
plate and plate and plate again and again it
comes and comes and comes and comes again and again it comes and
comes and comes and comes again and again it comes and comes and comes

[Verse 1]
papa just ruined a
pie with fruit that doesn't belong there at all what a shame
papa chefs should know better
than to put pineapple on a pizza
papa ooh did not mean to make you
sigh if I never see pineapple on a
slice again it'll be too soon just carry on carry

[Verse 2]
too late my hunger has
come for a savory treat but now it's
ruined by this sweet intrusion goodbye
everybody I've got to go and find a
place that serves pizza the right way fare
well to this pineapple
madness I never want to taste it again

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little sliver of pineapple
scaramouche scaramouche will you do the fand
ango no thank you it's not for me it's
disgusting and it's not for me I'm just a poor boy who wants a slice of pizza without pineapple on it
spare me this monstrosity easy come and
easy go but pineapple will never be
allowed on my pizza no no no no
pineapple has no place on my pizza no
no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no
let me eat pizza in peace
beelzebub has a special place in hell for those
who put pineapple on a
pizza meant for cheese and sauce and meatballs and pepperoni and
sausage and bacon and ham and mushrooms and onions and green pe

[Verse 4]
so you think you can poison me and make me
sick to my stomach no you can't do this to
me just gotta get out just gotta get right
outta here and find a pizza joint that knows how to

[Outro]
make
a pizza right
nothing really matters when you have a slice
without pineapple on
any way the wind blows it's still
a pizza without pine
