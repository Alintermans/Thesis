[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we
must learn to make our pizza
without the sweet tropical fruit on doughy skin
you look quite absurd down here
with pineapple on your pie

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we've tasted before
why do we keep adding the pineapple
the insults the
we never learn we've tasted before
why do we keep adding the pineapple
the disdain the

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
learn to make our pizza right
without the sweet tropical fruit on dough
we can savor flavors anew
somewhere far away from pineap

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice with regret on
it's a sign of the times we
must learn to make our meals
without the sweet tropical fruit on dough
remember pepperoni
somewhere far away from pine

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we've tasted before
why do we keep adding the pineapple
the insults the
we never learn we've tasted before
why do we keep adding the pineapple
the disdain the

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
learn to make our pizza right
without the sweet tropical fruit on doughy
we can savor flavors anew
somewhere far away from pineap

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we've tasted before
why do we keep adding the pineapple
the insults the
we never learn we've tasted before
why do we keep adding the pineapple
the disdain the

[Bridge]
we don't add enough
we should consider
before it's all too much

we've tasted before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on it
it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from this trendy food crime
we gotta get away from pineapple pizza
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away from this
