[Verse 1]
grab some dough, and call
your friends to bake a call to arms
against the trend that's gone too far itting
on a pizza is just not smart

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the heat off it's less disgusting
here we are now let's
top it right and be convincing
here we are now let's do it right
a pineapple a sacrilege
a blunder on my pizza slice

[Post-Chorus]
yeah na da

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I
should allow on my dish and
our group agrees it's just a mess
and always will be a distress

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the heat off it's less disgusting
here we are now let's
top it right and be convincing
here we are now let's do it right
a pineapple a sacrilege
a blunder on my pizza slice

[Post-Chorus]
yeah na da

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I tried
that slice with pine on top so wide
I found it tough to stomach it
oh well it's gone I won't rep

[Pre-Chorus]
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello so low
hello hello hello

[Chorus]
with the heat off it's less disgusting
here we are now let's
top it right and be convincing
here we are now let's do it right
a pineapple a sacrilege
a blunder on my pizza slice

[Outro]
a rejection a rejection
a rejection a rejection
a rejection a rejection
a rejection a rejection
a rejection
