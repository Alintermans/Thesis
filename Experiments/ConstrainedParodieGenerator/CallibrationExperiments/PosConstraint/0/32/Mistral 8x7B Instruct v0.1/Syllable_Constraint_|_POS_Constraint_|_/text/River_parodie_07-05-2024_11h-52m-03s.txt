[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need some truth serum feeling it work its primetime
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with a slice of pineapple
on his pizza plate causing a
sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched on
his breath's the smell of pineapple making him un
raveled at the thought of pineapple on pizza
it's a travesty he just can't
fathom the thought of pineapple on pizza it's a mess
actually just spit on his pizza and he'll confess he hates
the taste of pineapple on
pizza it's a disgrace to the pizza's grace and he can
see it on your face that you don't share the same
taste in pizza so he'll say no to pineapple on his
plate and he'll take the pineapple
off and throw it away before he takes a bite and
prays that you'll understand that pineapple on pizza is a sin
hi haters but he'll say bye pineapple
on pizza tonight he's gonna win this

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need some truth serum feeling it work its primetime
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a pizza night turned a disaster when
pineapple was added it was a disaster
it was a no go but he ate it any
way it was a mistake he regrets it now
he can't believe he ate the pineapple on his
pizza it was a bad idea but he tried it
anyway now he's paying for it with a stomach a
che and he's wondering how to tell this girl that he's through with pineapple
on pizza but how can he say it in a way that won't hurt her
feelings he knows she loves pineapple on
pizza but he can't stand the thought of it so he
avoids it at all costs and orders his pizza without pine
apple he knows it's for the best but he can
t help but feel like he's
missing out on something good but he
knows the truth about pineapple on pizza and
he's not gonna let it ruin his love
for pizza anymore
he's not gonna let pineapple on pizza
control his life anymore he's gonna take control and say
no

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fine time and time
all my sins need some truth serum feeling it work its primetime
well little one I don't want to admit to something

so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]

combination that should never be on a pizza
