[Intro]
come on now folks let's share our viewpoint on the

[Verse 1]
pineapple's
gravity's pull is quite un
believable on a pizza base so grand
why don't we just ban it from
our plates and
be content with other toppings
that blend in hand in hand with
cheese and sauce instead of this monstrosis

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
knowing that pineapple's gotta go
in this world it's just us
knowing that we gotta say no no
to pineapple pizza
we know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
dial the take
and tell them no pineapple
why add sweetness to a savory dish
when there's plenty of other
toppings
that can hit the spot with ease and
satisfaction guaranteed
it's just not worth the fuss oh oh oh toequal

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
knowing that pineapple's gotta go
in this world it's just us
knowing that we gotta say no no
to pineapple pizza
we know it's not the same

[Bridge]
stay home and bake your own pizza master
piece without the pineapple disaster looming near
leave the can of pineapple in the pan
it's not meant to be on a pizza my friend I tell

[Outro]
as
it was with
just cheese and tomato sauce on the
crust oh oh oh oh oh
