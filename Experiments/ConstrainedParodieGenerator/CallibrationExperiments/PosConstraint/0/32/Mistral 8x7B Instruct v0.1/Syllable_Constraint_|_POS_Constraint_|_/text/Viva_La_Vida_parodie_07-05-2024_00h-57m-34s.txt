[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love my
pizza pie complete with ham and
now I wake up to a slice so bland
with pineapple on this once

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to savor each
bite of my pizza without pineap
ple on it now it's just a
mess with sweet fruit where pepperoni sat
one bite in and I regret
my choice to add that yellow
disaster to my once perfect dish now
I see the error of my ways as I taste

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
the choir of pizza lovers sing
be my advocate and friend and
tell me why pineapple does not belong
for some reason I can't fath
om why anyone would put
pineapple on pizza
but that was before I tasted

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a regrettable
decision to put pineapple
on my pizza and now I see the
truth of how it just does not belong on
pizza lovers wait for
a slice without the tropical
fruit ruining the taste of their meal aw who
would ever want pineapple on their

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disappointment ring
the choir of pizza lovers sing
be my advocate and friend and
tell me why pineapple does not belong
for some reason I can't fathom
I know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was before I tasted

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
hear the bells of disapp
ointment ring oh oh oh oh oh oh
roman cavalry cho
rs are singing oh oh oh oh oh
be my advocate and
friend and tell me why pineapple
does not belong oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won
't call my name never an honest word but

ed pineapple on my pizza
