[Verse]
comin' out of my pineapple and I'm
gotta gotta be disgusted because I can
it started out with a slice and how did it end up like
this it was only a topping and now I'm feel
ing sick and she's callin' for a taxi and he
's havin' a snack and she's takin' a bite and now
they're goin' to bed and my stomach is twisted
and it's all in my taste

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's toppings his pizza
he takes off her dress now
let me go
'cause I just can't stomach it it's killin
me and takin' cont

[Chorus]
jealousy turnin' pizza into a
floating through toppings lullab
chokin' on your toppings al
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin' me
open up my hungry eyes
'cause I'm mr pepper

[Guitar Solo]
