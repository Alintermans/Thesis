[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me someth
pineapple on a pizza should not
be it's just not right
don't you agree with me tonight

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
we're falling
in the toppings game we're playing it cooler
for a
taste that's just not worth exploring no

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
pineapple on a pizza is just not
the way to go it
ain't it clear to see don't you

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
we're falling
in the toppings game we're playing it cooler
for a
taste that's just not worth exploring no

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the che
crash through the surface where it can't sting us
we're far from the spicy now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the ha ha shallow in
the ha ha shallow la la la low
in the ha ha shallow we
are far from the spicy now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ha ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the che
crash through the surface where it can't sting us
we're far from the spicy now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
we're off the deep end watch
as we dive in we'll never meet the
crash through the surface where
we're far from the spicy now
