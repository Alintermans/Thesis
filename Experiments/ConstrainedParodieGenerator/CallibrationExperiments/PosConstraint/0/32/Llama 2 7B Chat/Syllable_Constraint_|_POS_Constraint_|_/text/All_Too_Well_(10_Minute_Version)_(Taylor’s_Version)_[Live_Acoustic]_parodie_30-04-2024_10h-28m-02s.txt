[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
how could you even consider such a sin
it's like putting cheese on a hot dog or pe
something just doesn't make sense within our

[Verse 2]
the toppings are meant to complement and enhance the
base of the pizza not clash and offend the
sensibilities of the palate with a fruit
that's sweet and juicy and belongs on a plate

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's hard to break
the habit of putting things
on a pizza that don't belong but trust me
it's worth the

[Chorus]
because pineapple on a pizza is a
transgression that can never be forgiven or forgotten
like a scar that will always
remind us of the error of

[Verse 3]
the culinary crimes that we have committed against
the sacred tradition of pizza making with its rich history
and cultural significance that cannot be ignored or
disregarded with a flippant attitude and a
careless disregard for the art of pizza making as a
culinary masterpiece that deserves our
respect and adoration not our scorn and rid
contemptuously throwing pineapple on a pizza is
like spitting on the grave of the
great pizza makers who came before us and
left us with a legacy
of deliciousness and perfection that we must honor
and uphold with every bite and every to

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's hard to break
the habit of putting things on
a pizza that don't belong but trust
me it's worth the fight to preserve

[Chorus]
the purity of the pizza and the joy it
brings to our lives and the cultural significance it
holds for us as a food
loving community that must
never compromise on the integrity of the
pizza or the happiness it brings to our tables
because pineapple on
a pizza is a sin that cannot

[Bridge]
be tolerated or excused away
it's a betrayal of the
trust that we have placed in the pizza mak
ers and the culmin
ation of a once great
tradition that must be preserved
and passed down to future generations as a precious gift
and not a bastardization of a beautiful art form
that must be discarded and forgotten like a
mistake of the past that we must

[Verse 4]
we must stand united against this threat to our
way of life and our love for pizza
we must not be swayed by the false promises of flavor and novel
ty that pineapple brings for
we must hold the line against this culinar
y aggression and defend our pizza with every fiber of
our being because the fate of
our pizza traditions and our
happiness depends
on it and we cannot let the forces of
innovation and experimentation te
arbitrarily disrupt the delicate balance of flavors
and textures that make a pizza perfect and complete and

[Verse 5]
we must not be lulled into a false sense
of security by the familiarity of the toppings we
know and love because the pizza world is a changing
and evolving landscape and we must be vigil
ant against the introduction of new and un
proven toppings that may threaten the integrity
of our beloved pizza
we must stand strong and united in

[Chorus]
our opposition to pineapple
on a pizza because it is a threat to our
way of life and our
love for pizza that cannot be
ignored or dismissed and must
be taken serious
ly and with conviction
because the fate of the
pizza tradition and
our happiness depends on

[Verse 6]
and I know it's hard to break the habit of putting things on
a pizza that don't belong but trust me
it's worth the fight to preserve the puri
ty of the pizza and the joy it brings to
our lives and the cultural sign
ificance it holds for us as a food loving
community that mustn't
be compromised on the integrity
of the pizza or the hap pen
it brings to our tables and

[Outro]
so let us stand united against this culinary
transgression and defend our pizza with all of
our might because the fate of the pizza tradition and o
ur happiness depends on it and we
cannot let the forces of innov
ation and experimentation
disrupt the delicate balance of flavors
and textures that make a pizza perfect
and complete and worthy of our
love and adoration because the
pizza is a gift from the gods
and we must honor it with every
bite and every topping that we
carefully select and lovingly
place upon it because the fate
of the pizza tradition and our
happiness depends on it and we
must not let the forces of innov
ation and experimentation tear it
