[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a reason to despise the
pineapple on my pizza should not
be a crime against human
ity found

[Verse]
it's sweet and juicy and oh so
tempting but it just doesn't belong on my pie like a
fungus grows on a rotten log it
just doesn't belong on my pizza like a
fungus grows on a ro
rotten log it just doesn't belong on my pizza like
a cat on a dog it just doesn't mix
and you know what they say don't fix it if it ain't
broken don't add something that
completely changes the flavor and texture of my me
precious pizza like a pineapple
on a pizza is like a sunburn on a
nun it just doesn't make sense to
add something that brings no value to the table like a
pineapple on my pizza should not be
and you know what they say don't fix it if it ain't broke

[Chorus]
in my oven it
in my oven it
in my oven it will burn
in my oven it
in my oven it will burn
in my oven it

[Outro]
in my oven
in my oven it will
in my oven it will
in my oven it will burn burn
