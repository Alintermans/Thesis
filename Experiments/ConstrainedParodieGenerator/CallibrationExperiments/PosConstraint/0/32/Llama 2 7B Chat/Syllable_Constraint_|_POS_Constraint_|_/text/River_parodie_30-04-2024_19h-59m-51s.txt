[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a sin
been a topping for some grease and cheese and pepperoni too
all my toppings need holy water washing over me
well little pizza pie I don
don't want to admit to something if it's just
gonna cause a stomach

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his crust all soggy and
toppings scattered like a hurric
on his breath's pineapple he's
a fruit addict and he just wants to exact ven
it's a chess match he's on his back
she's kept track of all his toppings choices
and guess who just happens to be moving on to the next
actually just had a slice of pepperoni and mushrooms too
and she's devised some plan to
stretch him in the oven like a pizza doughnut or two
knife in hand says their relationship's hanging like
by a string of sausage pepperoni too much to bear
and I know she's using me to
try to top him in the toppings game I don't care
hi pepperoni but I shoulda said bye pepperoni too
after the first topping but tonight I am
just a pineapple on a pizza should

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a sin
been a topping for some grease and cheese and pepperoni too
all my toppings need holy water washing over me
well little pizza pie I don
don't want to admit to something if it's just
gonna cause a stomach

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night topping turned a two night to
it was come crust go now we hug tight and stretch too
he found out now she feels topped and used and ab
cause he left so what he did it first to her
too but now how am I supposed to tell this pizza
I'm aloof nervous and sauce I don't want to hurt
don't take it personal I just can't say this in
person to you so I revert to the studio like a pizza box
don't have to be reserved in a slice too much to bear too much to
and now that I got you I don't want
to use toppings on you took advantage in my to
thirst to pursue more toppings too much to bear too much to bear
and now that I got you I don't want
to use toppings on you took advantage
in my toppings game I don't care
hi mushrooms but I shoulda said bye mushrooms too
after the first topping but tonight I
am just a pineapple
on a pizza should not be a sin too much
to bear too much to bear too much to bear too much to bear too

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a sin
been a topping for some grease and cheese and pepperoni too
all my toppings need holy water washing over me
well little pizza pie I don
don't want to admit to something if it's just
gonna cause a stomach

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pepperoni
my name
pe
pizza pie
call me pepperoni
pepperoni we'll let the toppings

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the topping never the pie he
fuck can I say if life was a pizza
and toppings were an enclave I'd be swerving in five lan
speeds at a high rate like I'm pizza delivery
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my toppings
straight but I made you terminate my to
this love triangle left us in a pizza box
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your to
and now that I got you I don't
want to use toppings on you took advantage

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a sin
been a topping for some grease and cheese and pepperoni too
all my toppings
need holy
water washing over me well little
pizza pie
I don't want to admit to
something if it's just gonna cause a stomachache
the truth and my toppings
