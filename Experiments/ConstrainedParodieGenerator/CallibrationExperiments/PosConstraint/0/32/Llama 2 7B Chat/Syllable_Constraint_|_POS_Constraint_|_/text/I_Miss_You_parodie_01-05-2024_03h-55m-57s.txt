[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the fruit from hawaii in
the topping of a pizza in
disarray and confusion
we cannot abide by the
rules of taste and decency and tradition
we must break free from the norm
and embrace the sweet and tangy flav
of a pineapple paradise on top
of a pizza that's oh

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where are the pepperoni and
the sausage and the bacon and the be
olives and the mushrooms and the
onions and the bell
peppers and the olives and the tomatoes
and the cheese and the sauce and
the crust that's oh so fine and
the toppings that are divine and the
flavors that are simply sublime
do not waste your time on me
I am already pineapple in dis
guise and I cannot

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on me I'm
already pineapple
don't waste your time on
me I'm already pineapple in disgu
do not waste your time on
me I'm already lost

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on me I'm already
pineapple in disgu
don't waste your time on
me I'm already lost in the pineapple
sea of confusion and
delusion and despair
don't waste your time on me I'm already
pineapple in disgu
do not waste your time on
me I'm already pineapple in disgu
do not waste your time on
me I'm already lost

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
