[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on a pizza
but to me it's just a crime having pineapple
on a beautiful pie that's just
a perfect combination of
sauce cheese and toppings all in harmony oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 2]
you say it adds a sweetness and a
unique flavor to the dish but
to me it's just a culinary abom

it's like putting ketchup on a ste

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 3]
you may think me crazy for this
belief but I just can't help
myself pineapple on pizza is just wrong
it's like a sin or a curse or someth

no matter how hard you try to make it right

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on

[Verse 4]
I know I'm not alone
in this belief that pineapple has
no place on a pizza pie it's just not right
and if you think about it you
might just see the light and join me
in this crusade against pineapple pizza

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple doesn't belong on
hallelujah hallelujah

[Outro]
so let's all join together and

pizza again it's time to take a stand and
make things right and if you're still not convinced
just remember that pineapple
on pizza is a broken halleluj

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time when pizza was
perfect just cheese sauce and toppings
but then came pineapple and it all went wrong
and now we're left to pick up the pie
ces of our broken hearts and
try to make things right again oh oh oh oh oh

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a pizza god
above who's watching over us
but all we've ever learned from pineapple is
how to ruin a good thing by adding
something that just doesn't belong and
it's not a cry that you hear at night it's just a
