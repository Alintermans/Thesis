[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a soul
it's the flavor of a dream noble
knows everyone's disapproval
I should've ordered it sooner
if the menu ever did speak
it's the last true delight
every bite's gettin' more sle
a fresh topping each week
we were born hungry you heard them say
my stomach offers no absol
utes she tells me worship in the
kitchen the only pizza I'll
be sent to is when I'm with
you I was born hungry but love
it command me to be

[Pre-Chorus]
amen men
amen men

[Chorus]
take me to pie
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your che
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your
knife offer me that deathless
death oh good pizza let me give you
my life take me
to pie I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of
your che I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharp
en your knife offer me that
deathless death oh good pizza let me

[Verse 2]
if I'm a pagan of the good to
pings my lover's the sau
ce to keep the taste on my side
she demands a sacrifice
drain the whole pie get somethin' tasty
somethin' cheesy for the main course
that's a fine lookin' crust what
you got in the kitchen we
ve a lot of starvin' faithful
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hungry work

[Chorus]

death oh good pizza let me give you

to pie I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of
your che I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharp
en your knife offer me that
deathless death oh good pizza let me

[Bridge]
no toppings or slices when the hunger begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
in the madness and soil of that sad pizza scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen men pre

[Chorus]
take me to pie
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your che
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your
knife offer me that deathless
death oh good pizza let me give you
my life take me
to pie I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of
your che I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharp
en your knife offer me that
deathless death oh good pizza let me
