[Verse]
comin' out of my pizza joint and I've been doin'just
gotta gotta have a slice because I want it
it started out with a topping how did it end up like
it was only a topping it was only a
now I'm fallin' asleep and my stomach is sick
and he's havin' a pineapple and she's
takin' a bite now let me go because I just
can't look it's killin

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's touchin' my tongue now
he takes off the cheese now
let me go
because I just can't taste it's killin
me and takin' cont

[Chorus]
pineapple turnin' pizzas into the
trash swimmin' through sick flavors
chokin' on your lies but it
just the price I pay for be
in' mr brightside of the
pizza game open up your
eager taste buds cause
