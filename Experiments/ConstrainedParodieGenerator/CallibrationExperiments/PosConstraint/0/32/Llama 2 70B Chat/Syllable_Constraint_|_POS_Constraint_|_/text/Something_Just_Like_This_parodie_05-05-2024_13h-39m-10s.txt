[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for
a long time now it's true
but there's one topping that
I just can't get through
it's the pineapple
it's just not right ia
it doesn't belong on a pie ia ia iah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go I
don't know how much more
I can take of this pineapple
it's just not what I adore
I'm not looking for
a fruit that's so sweet
just something that's
new york style pizza to
eat and enjoy ia iah

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like
a pizza without
pineapple on top iao
ia ial ia ial ia
I want something just like
a pizza that's not
ruined by fruit ia
ia ia ia ia
ia ia ia iao

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading reviews of
pizza places online
people raving about
their favorite toppings
but when I see pineap
ple on the list ia
I just can't help but cringe ia ia

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk iao
I'm not looking for a topping
that's so divisive ia
I'm not looking for
a fruit that's so sweet
just something that's ia iah
new york style pizza to

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like a
pizza without pineapple

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
ia ia ia
ia ia iao
ia ia ia
ia ia iao ia iao
ia ia ia
ia ia iao
ia ia ia

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for a topping
that's so divisive ia
I'm not looking for
a fruit that's so sweet
just something that's ia iah
new york style pizza to
eat and enjoy ia iah

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this iao
ia ia ia ia
I want something just like this iao
