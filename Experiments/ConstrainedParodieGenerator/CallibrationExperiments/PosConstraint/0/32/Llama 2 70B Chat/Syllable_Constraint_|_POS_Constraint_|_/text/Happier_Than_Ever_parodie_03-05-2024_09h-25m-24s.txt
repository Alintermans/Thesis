[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
makes me wanna lose my
appetite every

[Verse 1]
I try to be open minded give it a chance hear
people rave about the
combination but to me
it's just a weird fusion don
t get the fascination please
some things are better left alone
like pineapple on my pie
it's not a taste sensation it's just wrong
like wearing socks with sandals all day long
I know you think it's hip but trust me it's not cool being a rebel
against pizza tradition
it's just not worth the trouble
it's a crime against pizza nature taking over
like a bad disease taking down

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a

[Verse 2]
you call me a hater or a pur

I don't post about it on the internet I don
't want to start a war but when I see it
I can't help but feel sad that people ruin

ham or bacon that's just as bad or
worse it's time to draw the line and take back our pizza her
itage don't let the trend setters win make a stand
and leave the pineapple in the fruit bowl where it belongs
with all the other fruit that doesn't belong

[Outro]
you ruined pizza
you're misunderstanding what's good took
a classic and made it your
own now leave it alone it's time
to
move on
ah
goddam
ah it
