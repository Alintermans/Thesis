[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I hate it when you put

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on a pizza with meats and
veggies galore it's such a sin to me
it doesn't belong there no
matter how you try to conv
ince me otherwise it's just not right it's like
putting ketchup on a hot
dog or mayonnaise on a pizza
it's a crime against humanity and
I won't stand for it

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza the way
it's meant to be I miss

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
the cheese and sauce and toppings too
but pineapple just doesn't fit the bill
it's like a spiky alien
invasion on a
piece of dough it's an abomination and
I can't condone it no
matter how hard you try to
make it taste good it's just not right it
sticks out like a sore thumb and it
hurts my taste buds to even
think about it so please don't do it
please don't do it

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple pizza
you're already the voice
inside my head telling
me it's wrong don't waste your time on pineap
ple pizza you're alread
y the voice inside mind

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple pizza
you're already the voice
inside my head telling
me it's wrong don't waste your time on pineap
ple pizza you're alread
y the voice inside mind
don't waste your time on pineapple pizza
you're already the voice
inside my head telling
me it's wrong don't waste your time on pineap
ple pizza you're alread
y the voice inside mind

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza the way
it's meant to be I miss
pineapple free pizza
the way it's meant to be
