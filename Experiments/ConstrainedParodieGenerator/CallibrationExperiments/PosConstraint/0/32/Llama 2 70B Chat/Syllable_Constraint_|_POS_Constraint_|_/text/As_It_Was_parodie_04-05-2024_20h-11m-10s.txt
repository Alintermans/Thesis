[Intro]
come on pineappleheads we wanna say goodbye

[Verse 1]
holdin' us back
pineapples on pizza are
I want you to hold out the pizza in your
hand why don't we leave it plain
nothin' to say
when pineapples get in the way
seems you cannot be replaced
and pizza is the one that will stay oh

[Chorus]
in this world pizza is
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world pizza is
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the phone
pineapple you're no good on
why are you sitting at home on the floor
what kind of toppings are you
ringin' the bell
and nobody's coming to help
your taste buds live by themselves
they just want to know that you're well oh again

[Chorus]
in this world pizza is
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world pizza is
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home get ahead order takeout food
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave pineapples behind don't follow
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
