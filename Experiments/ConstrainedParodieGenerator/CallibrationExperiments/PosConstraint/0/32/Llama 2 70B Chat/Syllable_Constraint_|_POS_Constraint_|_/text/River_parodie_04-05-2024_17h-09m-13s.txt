[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater, been a
been a criticizer of
all the pineapples on pizza need a new home in the bin
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the pineapple

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his stom
ach scratched from eating pineapple
on his pizza crust it's a crime and
he's feeling quite whacked he just wants to go back to
normal pizza toppings and forget this pineap
ple experiment exists and she just
wants to exact revenge and get back at the chef who did
this to her pizza she's on his back like a jetpack she's kept track of
all his pineapple toppings
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
pizza joint actually just shit on my last
slice and she has what my taste buds lack because she loves anch
ovies and you don't f
with no man's pizza even I know that but she's de
vised some plan to make him regret his toppings choices knife in
hand says their pizza's hangin' by a strand so
she's been on the web lately says maybe

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
she'll be my gwen stacy to
spite her man and I know she

now she feels deserted and used because he
left so what he did it first to her too now
how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through it
s hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and sue
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners don
t have to be reserved In a booth I
just feel like the person who I'm turning into's irre
versible I preyed on you like it's church at the pew and now that
I got you I don't want you took advant
age In my thirst to pursue why do I
do this dirt that I do get onmy
soapbox and preach my sermon and speech detergent
and bleach is burnin' the wound because now
with her in thewomb we
can't bring her in this world shoulda knew to
use protection before I bit into your forbidden fruit
