[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up and declare

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my eager taste buds gazing
at the menu up on the wall with stars in
our eyes autumn leaves falling down like choices
and I can picture it all now in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that flavor's not here no more
and I might be okay but my taste buds are not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost ordered a hawaiian with ham and pineapple
wind In my hair I
remember it all too well how

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza on the counter your stomach was
growling you used to be a little kid with a big appetite in
a twin sized bed and your mom's telling stories bout you and anch
you told me bout your cravings thinking your future was
me and you were tossing me the menu saying fuck the rules
key chain on the ground we were always skipping town
and I was thinking on the drive down any topping
now he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it
was til we were full and gone and
buried check the pulse and come back swearing it
s the same after three months
in the grave and then you wondered where It went to as I
reached for you but all I felt was shame and you held me

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we're eating in the kitchen in the refrigerator
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an
oath sacred prayer and we
d swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I m a crumpled up piece of paper
lying here cause I remember

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I m in a new
hell every time you double cross pe
trayal of the senses you said if we had been closer in age maybe
it would have been fine and that
made me want to die the idea you had
of me who was she a never needy ever lovely jewel whose mine
reflects on you not weeping in a
party bathroom some pizza asking me
what happened you that
s what happened you you who charmed my taste bud
s with self effacing jokes sipping coffee like
you re on a late night show but then he watched me watch the front door
all night willing you to come and he said it s supposed

[Verse 5]
time won t fly it s like I m paralyz
zed by it I d like to be my old self again but I m still
trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when
you made me your own now you mail back my toppings
and I walk home alone but you keep my old scar
f from that very first week cause it reminds you of
innocence and it smells like
me you can t get rid of it cause

[Chorus]
you remember it all too well yeah you
remember it all too well wind in my hair you were
there you remember it
all too well and I know it's long
gone and there was nothing else
I could do and I forg
et about you long en
ough to forget why I
needed to you remem
ber it all too well yeah down the

[Verse 6]
stairs you were there you remember it all too well and I was
never good at topping jokes but the punch line
goes I ll get older but your pizza
stays my age from when your hawaiian broke me
skin and bones I m a soldier who
s returning half my weight and did the twinflame
bruise paint you blue just between
us did the love affair maim you too cause
in this city s barren cold
I still remember the first fall

[Outro]
of snow and how it glistened as it fell I remember
it all too well just between us did the love affair
maim you all too well just between us do you remember it all
too well just between us I remember
it all too well wind in my hair you
were there down the stairs you were there you
remember it all too well it was rare you
remember it all too well wind in and
down the stairs you were there you were there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it
all too well wind in my hair I was there
down the stairs you were there you were there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it
all too well wind in my hair I was there
down the stairs you were there you were there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all too well

[Spoken Outro]
I love pizza so much
