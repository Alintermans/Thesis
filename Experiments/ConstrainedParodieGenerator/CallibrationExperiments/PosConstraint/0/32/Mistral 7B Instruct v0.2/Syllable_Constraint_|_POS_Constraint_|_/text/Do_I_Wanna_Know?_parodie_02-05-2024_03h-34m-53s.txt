[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clings like something in
the middle of your slice where it
should be cheese and tomato's
significance have you no idea that it's
a culinary blunder that
I've dreamt about this
pineapple on a pizza that makes me think of you somehow
until I take a bite and spill my drink on the

[Pre-Chorus]
is it worth the try if the flavors aligns right
was hoping for a taste that would delightful surprise
we both know that the nights were made for eating right
for savoring flavors that you can't

[Chorus]
crawlin' back
to this fruit on a pizza
ever thought of
ordering it
when you've had a
few slices' craving
maybe I'm too addicted
to its sweet and sav
to fall for a plain

[Verse 2]
have you got the courage
to admit that this combination's not
a winner and if so I wanna know what
topping you'd prefer instead of this fruit's gotcha gotcha
but we could be a perfect pair if you wanted to share a
pizza pie with me instead of this unwanted guest
but I don't know if you feel the same as me

[Pre-Chorus]
is it worth the try if the flavors aligns right
was hoping for a taste that would delightful surprise
we both know that the nights were made for eating right
for savoring flavors that you can't

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to you pineapple pizza
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a few cravings
'cause I always do pine
apple pie too busy being yours to
fall for a pepperoni or
a vegetarian's delight
now I've thought it through
crawlin' back to you

[Outro]
is it worth the try if the flavors aligns right
was hoping for a taste that would delightful surprise
we both know that the nights were made for eating right
for savoring flavors that you can't tomorrow
is it worth the try too busy being yours to fall
ever thought of ordering pineapple free from this
is it worth the try do you want me crawlin' back to you
