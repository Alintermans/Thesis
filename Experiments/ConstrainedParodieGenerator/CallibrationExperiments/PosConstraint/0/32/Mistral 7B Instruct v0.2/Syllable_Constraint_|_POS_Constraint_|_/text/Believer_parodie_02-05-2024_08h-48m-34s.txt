[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
a taste that just won't persist

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you argue with me about this trendy
topping on my pizza
I'm the one with the say so honey
the one with the say so honey

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on the classics
cheese and pepperoni were my bas
tomato sauce was my passion
but pineapple on my pizza was a fashionless
singing from frustration from the
pineapple debate that never
endingly rages on and on
seeing the arguments through the

[Chorus]
painstaking process you made me a
believer
pineapple on a pizza you drive
me crazy believer
painstaking process you break me down build me
up believer we'll never agree
pineapple on a pizza you made
me a believer oh

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the ones up above
for the day that pineap
ple goes away from my love storyline
our tastebuds up above

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shocked in the kitchen
mixing my emotions in the
dough and sauce and toppings galore
hoping my preferences would
prevail but they never did ebbin' and flowin'
inhibited limited till it broke open and changed the
flavor profile

[Chorus]
painstaking process you made me a
believer
pineapple on a pizza you drive
me crazy believer
painstaking process you break me down build me
up believer we'll never agree
pineapple on a pizza you made
me a believer oh

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the fire and the flames
you're the face of the future
the toppings in
my veins oh oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ebbin' and flowin' in inhib
ited limited till it broke open and changed the flavor
profile it changed

[Chorus]
painstaking process you made me a
believer
pineapple on a pizza you drive
me crazy believer
painstaking process you break me down build me
up believer we'll never agree
pineapple on a pizza you made
me a believer oh
