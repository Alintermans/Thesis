[Verse 1]
just stop your whining it's a
sign of the pineapple times
welcome to the final slice of
pizza's ultimate demise's showtimeis it
pineapple on your pizza
but it's not really tasty

[Pre-Chorus]
we never blend we've been here before
why are we always stuck and ordering
this unwelcome topping
we never blend we've been here before
why are we always stuck and ordering
this unwelcome topping

[Chorus]
just stop your whining it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
just stop your whining it'll be fineo
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here

[Verse 2]
just stop your whining have the taste of your life
breaking through the savory
crust remember everything
will be alright without this pineapple
we can meet again somewhere
somewhere far away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
we never blend we've been here before
why are we always stuck and ordering
this unwelcome topping
we never blend we've been here before
why are we always stuck and ordering
this unwelcome topping

[Chorus]
just stop your whining it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
stop your whining baby it'll be fineo
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
we never blend we've been here before
why are we always stuck and ordering
this unwelcome topping
we never blend we've been here before
why are we always stuck and ordering
this unwelcome topping

[Bridge]
we don't mix enough
we should open up
before it's all too much
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
stop your whining baby it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
