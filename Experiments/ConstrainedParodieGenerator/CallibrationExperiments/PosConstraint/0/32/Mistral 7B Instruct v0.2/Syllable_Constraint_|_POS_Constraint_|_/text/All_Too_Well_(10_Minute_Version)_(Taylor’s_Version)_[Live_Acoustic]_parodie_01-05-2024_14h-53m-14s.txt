[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it felt like a mistake
and I left my pizza there with pineapple
and you've still got it in your fridge now looking

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet disposition and my wide eyes rolled in
we're arguing in the kitchen about this
pineapple on a pizza pie creation spin
and I can picture it after all these nights

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
this debate's not here no more
but I'm not okay and I'm not fine at
all about

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red because you were looking at
me and the pineapple on
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter our opinions clashing
you used to be a lover of the classic cheese and tomato dash
and your father's shaking his head at our disagreement
you told me about your past and your preference was
pineapple free but I was tossing my opinion at you
keyboard on the table our debate raging
and I was thinking on the debate floor any time
now you'll say it's a matter of taste and tradition but
that's not true and then you wondered
where it went to as I reached for the pineap
please but all I felt was shame
and you held my lifeless argument in disdain and said
but all I felt was shame and you held

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light about this fruit on
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like a rule
promise to remember
to remember it all too well yeah

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this debate was a master
piece till you tore it
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to belittle me in the
name of being honest and true to yourself but all I feel
is shame and you held my lifeless argument in
disdain and said but all I felt

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you change my mind about
pineapple on a pizza pie I said if we had been closer in
taste maybe it would have been
finer but that made me want to die the thought
that pineapple on a pizza pie was finer than the classic cheese and
tomato combination but that
made me want to die the idea you
had of me who was
a never needing never loving jewel
whose taste preferences reflect on me not we
eping in a party bathroom some food critic asking me what
happened you that's what happened you you who charmed my dad with

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after pepperoni days and nights when you made me
your own now you send back my order and I walk
alone but you keep my old pepperoni from
that very first week it reminds you of innocence
and it smells like me you can
't get rid of it cause you remember

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
pineapple on my pizza
you remember it all
down the stairs I was there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapple stays the
same from when your pineapple broke my
skin and bones I'm a soldier who's returning
half your pizza weight and did the pine
apple bruise paint you blue just between us did the
love affair maim you too cause
in this city's barren cold I stillrem
ember the first fall of snow and
how it glistened as it fell on

[Outro]
I still remember the first fall of snow and how it
glistened as it fell on our debate about pine
apple on a pizza pie I still remember it all too well
pineapple on my pizza you remem
ber it all too well I still remem
ber it all too well I still remem
ber it all too well I still remember it
all too well pineapple on my pizza
you remember it all too well pine
apple on my pizza you remem
ber it all too well pineapple
on my pizza you remember it all
too well pineapple on my pizza
you remember it all too well pine
apple on my pizza you rem
ember it all too well pineapple on

[Spoken Outro]
