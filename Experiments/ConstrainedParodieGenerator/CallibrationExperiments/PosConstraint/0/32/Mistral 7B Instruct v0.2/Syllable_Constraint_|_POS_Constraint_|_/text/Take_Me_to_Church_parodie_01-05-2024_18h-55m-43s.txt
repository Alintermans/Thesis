she's the pineapple at the table
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've spoken up before
if the kitchens ever did dec
she's the last true defense
every pizza's gettin' more ble
a fresh disappointment
we were born picky what they say it
my kitchen offers no comprom
she tells me change the toppings quicker
the only pizza I'll be sent to
is when I'm alone with you
I was born picky but I love
pineapple on my pie

[Pre-Chorus]

I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pie
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your

[Bridge]
no chefs or kings when the ritual begins part
there is no sweeter harmony than our gentle dish
in the chaos and sauce of that sad kitchen scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your

I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pie
