He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say?
