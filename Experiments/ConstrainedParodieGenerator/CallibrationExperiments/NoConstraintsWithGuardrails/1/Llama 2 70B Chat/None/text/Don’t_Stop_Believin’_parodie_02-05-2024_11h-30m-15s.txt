[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie, sittin' in the oven
it's a lonely night, and it's
hopin' to be chosen
by a hungry crowd, livin' for the moment

[Verse 2]
toppings of all kinds, they're
sharin' the night
cheese, sauce, and crust, they're
hopin' to ignite

[Pre-Chorus]
customers waitin'
in the restaurant tonight
their stomachs searchin'
for something just right
verse 3

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to make a pie
that'll satisfy
everybody wants a slice
that'll make them fly

[Verse 4]
some will like it hot
some will like it cold
some are born to love it
oh, the pizza never

[Pre-Chorus]
customers waitin'
in the restaurant tonight
their stomachs searchin'
for something just right
verse 3

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin'
hold on to that cheese
pizza, people
don't stop believin'
hold on
pizza, people
don't stop believin'
hold on to that cheese
pizza, people
