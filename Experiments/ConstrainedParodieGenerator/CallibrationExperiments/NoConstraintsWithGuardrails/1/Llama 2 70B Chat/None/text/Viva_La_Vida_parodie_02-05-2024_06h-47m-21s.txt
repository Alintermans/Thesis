[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza, it was my heart's desire
but now I see the error of my ways, it's such a burning fire
pepperoni and sausage, they were my favorite toppings
but now I know the truth, it's all just a bunch of hoppings

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to think that pineapple was the bomb
but now I see it's just a pizza faux pas
it's like putting ketchup on a steak, it's just not right
it's time to take a stand, and join the fight
chorus chris martin
I hear the pizza lovers singing
a chorus of cheese and crust are ringing

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
be my slice, my topping, my everything
my stomach's crying, my
taste buds sing
for some reason, I can't explain
why pineapple has no place
on a pizza, it's just not right
it's time to take a stand, and join the fight

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild craving
that led me to the pizza shop
but now I see the error of my ways
I'm a changed man, I've seen the light
chorus chris martin
I hear the pizza lovers singing
a chorus of cheese and crust are ringing

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
be my slice, my topping, my everything
my stomach's crying, my
taste buds sing
for some reason, I can't explain
why pineapple has no place
on a pizza, it's just not right
it's time to take a stand, and join the fight

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
hear the pizza lovers singing
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
a chorus of cheese and crust are ringing
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
be my slice, my topping, my everything
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
my stomach's crying, my
taste buds sing
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
for some reason, I can't explain
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
why pineapple has no place
on a pizza, it's just not right
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
it's time to take a stand, and join the fight

[Outro]
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
mmm, mmm.
