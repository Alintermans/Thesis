[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me somethin', girl
why you puttin' pineapple on your p
it don't belong there, it's just not right
ain't no hawaiian pizza, it's a crime

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
from the heights of culinary might
for a pie that's just not worth the fight

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me somethin', boy
ain't you tired of that p
tryin' to make it taste like a tropical isle
but it's just a pizza, it's not worth your while

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm fallin'
from the heights of culinary might
for a pie that's just not worth the fight

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never touch the ground
crash through the surface where the toppings can't hurt us
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha-ha, sha-hollow
in the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
in the sha-ha, sha-hollow
we're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh, ha, ah, ha
oh-ah, ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never touch the ground
crash through the surface where the toppings can't hurt us
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha-ha, shallow
in the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
in the sha-ha, shallow
we're far from the shallow now
