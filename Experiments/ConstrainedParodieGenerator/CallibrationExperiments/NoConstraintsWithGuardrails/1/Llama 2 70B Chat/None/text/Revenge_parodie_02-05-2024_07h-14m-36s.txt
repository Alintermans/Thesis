[Intro]
I think i, I think I finally
found a way to forgive pine
for the crimes it commits on my pizza
I think that's the first step, right?
you agree?

[Verse]
I've dug a hole for pine, my dear
can't pretend that it's a topping, leaving me in fear
oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
if I could act on my cravings, no, would i?
some toppings are sweet, some are sour
and you'd have thought that I would let it slide and order
well, broken pizzas break hearts, so order fast
and I don't wanna let it go, so in my belly, it'll last
I've dug a hole for pine, my dear
can't pretend that it's a topping, leaving me in fear
oh, man, what a world, the things I hear
if I could act on my cravings, no, would i?
some toppings are sweet, some are sour
and you'd have thought that I would let it slide and order
well, broken pizzas break hearts, so order fast
and I don't wanna let it go, so in my belly, it'll last

[Chorus]
in my belly, it'll last
in my belly, it'll last
in my belly, it'll last-ast-ast
in my belly, it'll last
in my belly, it'll last-ast-ast
in my belly, it'll last

[Outro]
in my belly, it'll last
it'll last, it'll last, it'll last
is my hunger your satisfaction?
is all of my hunger your satisfaction?
enjoy
