[Verse 1]
first things first, let's get this straight
pineapple on pizza, it's a crime, it's a hate
ruining the flavor, the texture, the vibe
it's like putting ketchup on a steak, it's just not right

[Verse 2]
second thing second, don't even try
to tell me that it's good, it's a lie
the sweetness clashes, it's a sin
it's like putting honey on a pork chop, it's just not in

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a foodie, I know what I like
I don't need no pineapple on my
pizza, it's a travesty, it's a crime
ruining the taste, it's just not
chorus
pizza! you made me a, you made me a
believer, believer

[Chorus]
pain! you break me down, you build me up
believer, believer
pain! oh, let the hate flow, oh, let it rain
my taste, my love, my drive, it came from
pain! you made me a, you made me a
believer, believer
verse 3

[Verse 3]
third thing third, it's time to speak
listen up, let my words seep
into your mind, let them sink
pineapple on pizza, it's just not worth a dime
it's like putting ranch on a cake, it's just not right

[Pre-Chorus]
I was choking on a slice
the pineapple, it wasn't nice
it ruined the flavor, it ruined the night
it's like putting peanut butter on
a steak, it's just not right
chorus

[Chorus]
pain! you break me down, you build me up
believer, believer
pain! oh, let the hate flow, oh, let it rain
my taste, my love, my drive, it came from
pain! you made me a, you made me a
believer, believer
verse 3

[Verse 4]
last thing last, it's time to make a stand
no more pineapple on pizza, it's time to take a stand
it's time to fight, it's time to unite
against the pineapple, it's time to ignite
the

[Pre-Chorus]
flames of passion, the fire of hate
it's time to make a change, it's
time to debate

[Chorus]
pain! you break me down, you build me up
believer, believer
pain! oh, let the hate flow, oh, let it rain
my taste, my love, my drive, it came from
pain! you made me a, you made me a
believer, believer
