[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think
pineapple on a pizza is a link
to the heavens above, a taste divine
but let me tell you, that just ain't mine
it's a travesty, a culinary
crime, and I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
hallelujah, no pineapple on my pizza
hallelujah, it's a sin, it's a blunder

[Verse 2]
you say it's sweet, it's tropical, it's fun
but to me, it's just a bunch of b
sides, it don't belong on a pie that
's meant to be savory, not a fruit salad
and don't even get me started on the
texture, it's like biting into a

[Chorus]
hallelujah, no pineapple on my pizza
hallelujah, it's a sin, it's a blunder

[Verse 3]
juicy apple, but it's not the same
as biting into a crispy, cheesy,
saucy slice, no, it's just not the same
and when I'm eating pizza, I don'
want to be thinking of the tropics,
I want to be thinking of italy,

[Chorus]
hallelujah, no pineapple on my pizza
hallelujah, it's a sin, it's a blunder

[Verse 4]
of mozzarella, of pepperoni, of
fresh basil, of garlic, of
parmesan, of crust that'
crispy and golden, not soggy
and sweet, no, give me a break

[Chorus]
hallelujah, no pineapple on my pizza
hallelujah, it's a sin, it's a blunder
bridge
I know some of you will disagree
and that's okay, we all have our
own tastes, but for me and my
pizza, we'll stick to the classics,
the way it's meant to be,

[Outro]
hallelujah, no pineapple on my pizza

[Additional Lyrics]
I've heard some say it's a matter of taste
but to me, it's just a matter of fact
pineapple on a pizza, it's just not right
it's like putting ketchup on a steak,
it's like putting ice cream on a cake
it's just not meant to be, it's a mistake

[Additional Lyrics]
I know some of you will say it's
just a topping, it's just a choice
but to me, it's a sacrilege
it's like painting a mustache on the
monna lisa, it's like putting
graffiti on the ceiling of the sistine

[Additional Lyrics]
and maybe some of you will say
I'm just a snob, I'm just a hater
but to me, it's just the truth
pineapple on a pizza, it's just not
natural, it's just not right
it's like putting a square peg in a
