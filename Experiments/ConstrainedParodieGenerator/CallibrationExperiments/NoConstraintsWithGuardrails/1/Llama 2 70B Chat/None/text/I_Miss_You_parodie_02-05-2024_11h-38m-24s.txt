[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I protest, I protest

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple on a pizza, oh what a sight
the toppings in the store, they just don'
t excite
I long for pepperoni, or maybe some sausage
but no, they put pineapple, it's such an outrage
we can't have halloween on christmas
and in the night, we'll wish this never ends
we'll wish this never ends
interlude mark hoppus

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor, and where is the sense
in putting pineapple on a pizza,
it's such a sin
I crave for cheese and tomato,
not some sweet and sour
like a bad decision, it's such a blunder
will they stop this madness, and bring back the wonder?
stop this madness, and bring back the wonder?
chorus tom delonge and mark hoppus
chorus tom delonge and mark

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
the voice inside my head
I miss you, I miss you
don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
the voice inside my head
I miss you, I miss you
instrumental break

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
the voice inside my head
I miss you, I miss you
don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
the voice inside my head
I miss you, I miss you
don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
the voice inside my head
I miss you, I miss you

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
