[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for years
the toppings and the cheese
but one thing that I can't abide
is pineapple, it's just not right
it's a fruit that doesn't belong
on a pie that's meant to be savored

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said, where d'you wanna go?
how much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for a topping
that's gonna make me flip
I don't need no superhero
or fairytale delight
just something that tastes good
and won't give me a fright

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this
I want something just like this
oh, I want something just like this
verse 2 chris martin
I've been reading recipes old
the classics and the myths
but one thing that I can't unfold

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
is how pineapple found its way
onto a pie that's meant to stay
it's a travesty, a culinary crime
a fruit that's out of time
it's not like pepperoni or m

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said, where d'you wanna go?
how much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for a topping
that's gonna make me flip
I don't need no superhero

just something that tastes good
and won't give me a fright

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh, I want something just like this
doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo, doo, doo

oh, I want something just like this
doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo, doo, doo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go?
how much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for a topping

oh, I want something just like this
oh, I want something just like this
oh, I want something just like this
