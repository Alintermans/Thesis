[Verse]
comin' out of my pizza joint, I've been doin' just fine
gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
it started out with a slice, how did it end up like this?
it was only a slice, it was only a slice
now I'm fallin' asleep and my stomach is sick
and it's all in my head
pre-chorus

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's takin' my appetite now
he's takin' a bite now
let me go
'cause I just can't look, it's killin' me
and takin' control

[Chorus]
pineapple, turnin' pizzas into a crime
swimmin' through cheesy lies
chokin' on your toppings
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin' me
open up my eager eyes
'cause I'm mr. brightside

[Guitar Solo]
