[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your pizza?
do you ever get that feelin' it just don't fit?
like a square peg in a round hole, it just don't sit right
are there some toppings you'd like to admit?
have you no taste, or you just don't care?
I've dreamt of pizza, without the sweet
how many slices can you eat?
'cause there's this topping, it just don't feel right
an' I play it on repeat, until I get it right

[Pre-Chorus]
(do I wanna know?) if this topping's wrong?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' you'd be strong
(baby, we both know) that pineapple's not the way
for a pizza that's perfect, in every way

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to basics
ever thought of stickin' to the
classics?
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
busy lovin' pizza
to fall for somethin' new
now, I've thought it through
crawlin' back to the real deal

[Verse 2]
so have you got the guts to admit
that pineapple's just not pizza's best fit?
been wonderin' if your taste buds are still alive
and if so, I wanna know what pizza you'd
pick, if you had the choice
simmer down, an' pucker up, I'm sorry to intrude
it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to

[Pre-Chorus]
(do I wanna know?) if this topping's wrong?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' you'd be strong
(baby, we both know) that pineapple's not the way
for a pizza that's perfect, in every way

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to basics
ever thought of stickin' to the
classics?
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
busy lovin' pizza
to fall for somethin' new
now, I've thought it through
crawlin' back to the real deal

[Outro]
(do I wanna know?) if this topping's wrong?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' you'd be strong
(baby, we both know) that pineapple's not the way
for a pizza that's perfect, in every way
(do I wanna know?) too busy lovin' pizza
to fall for somethin' new
(sad to see you go) ever thought of stickin'
