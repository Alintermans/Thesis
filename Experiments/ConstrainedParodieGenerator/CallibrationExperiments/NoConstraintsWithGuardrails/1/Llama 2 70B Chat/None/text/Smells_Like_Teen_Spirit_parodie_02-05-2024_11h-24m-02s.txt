[Verse 1]
load up on toppings, bring your friends
it's fun to choose and to pretend
she's over-cheesed and self-assured
oh no, I know a pizza that's impure

[Pre-Chorus]
hello, hello, hello, how strange
hello, hello, hello, how strange
hello, hello, hello, how strange
hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings mixed, it's less delight
here we are now, judgment night
I feel awkward and contagious
here we are now, judgment night
a pineapple, an abomination
a pizza, my frustration

[Post-Chorus]
yeah, hey, yay

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I do best
and for this pizza, I feel blessed
our little group has always been
and always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
hello, hello, hello, how strange
hello, hello, hello, how strange
hello, hello, hello, how strange
hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings mixed, it's less delight
here we are now, judgment night
I feel awkward and contagious
here we are now, judgment night
a pineapple, an abomination
a pizza, my frustration

[Post-Chorus]
yeah, hey, yay

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I bite
oh yeah, I guess it's not right
I found it hard, it's hard to find
oh well, whatever, never mind

[Pre-Chorus]
hello, hello, hello, how strange
hello, hello, hello, how strange
hello, hello, hello, how strange
hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings mixed, it's less delight
here we are now, judgment night
I feel awkward and contagious
here we are now, judgment night
a pineapple, an abomination
a pizza, my frustration

[Outro]
a denial, a denial
a denial, a denial
a denial, a denial
a denial, a denial
a denial
