[Intro]
come on, pineapple, we wanna say goodbye to you

[Verse 1]
you're ruining the taste
of a perfectly good dish
I want you to take a hike
and leave pizza alone, why don't you?
nothin' to gain
when you're messin' with a classic
you're not worth the pain
and pizza's the one that will stay, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
in this world, it's just pizza
you know it's not the same with you
in this world, it's just pizza
you know it's not the same, it's not the same
as it was, as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple, you don't belong
why are you on top of my pie?
what kind of flavor are you tryin' to bring?
ringin' the bell
and nobody's comin' to save you
your taste is by itself
it just wants to be free, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
in this world, it's just pizza
you know it's not the same with you
in this world, it's just pizza
you know it's not the same, it's not the same
as it was, as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home, get a new recipe
I don't wanna talk about the way that it tastes
leave pizza alone, it's not a crime
I don't wanna talk about who's to blame

[Outro]
(hey)
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was, as it was
