[Verse 1]
just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times
pineapple on pizza, it's a crime
it's not a topping, it's a
abomination, a culinary crime
you can't disguise it with cheese
or hide it with sauce

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn, we've been here before
why do we keep putting it on
the pizza, the pizza?
we never learn, we've been here before
why do we keep putting it on
the pizza, the pizza?

[Chorus]
just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times
we gotta get rid of the pine
we gotta get rid of the pine
just stop your whining, it'll be alright
they told me that the taste is near
we gotta get rid of the pine

[Verse 2]
just stop your whining, have a slice of life
toppings that complement, not strife
pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms too
but pineapple, no, that's not what to do
we can meet again, somewhere
somewhere far away from the pine

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn, we've been here before
why do we keep putting it on
the pizza, the pizza?
we never learn, we've been here before
why do we keep putting it on
the pizza, the pizza?

[Chorus]
just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times
we gotta get rid of the pine
we gotta get rid of the pine
just stop your whining, it'll be alright
they told me that the taste is near
we gotta get rid of the pine

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn, we've been here before
why do we keep putting it on
the pizza, the pizza?
we never learn, we've been here before
why do we keep putting it on
the pizza, the pizza?

[Bridge]
we don't understand, we've been here before
why do we keep making the same mistake?
it's time to break the cycle, to break the mold
and leave the pineapple where it belongs
outro

[Outro]
stop your whining, it's a sign of the times
we gotta get rid of the pine
we gotta get rid of the pine
we gotta get rid of the pine
we got to, we got to, away
we got to, we got to, away
we got to, we got to, away
