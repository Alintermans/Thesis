[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria, the aroma filled the air
but something about it felt wrong, beyond compare
they had pineapple on the menu, I couldn't believe my eyes
how could they do this to a classic, it's such a crime

[Verse 2]
oh, the flavors they were mixing, it was a culinary crime
sweet and savory, they just didn't rhyme
pepperoni and sausage, they're classic toppings, fine
but pineapple, it just doesn't belong, it's such a waste of time

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's a popular topping, I've heard it's quite the rage
but to me, it's a travesty, a culinary sacrilege
I mean, who needs sweetness on their pizza, it's just not right
give me a break, let's keep it real, no tropical delight

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again, on that pizza floor
you're telling me it's delicious, but I'm not sure
wind in my hair, I'm feeling quite peculiar
I remember it all too well, it's just not my scene

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza, it's all over social media
you're raving about the flavors, it's just not my ideal
I'm a traditionalist, when it comes to pizza toppings
pineapple doesn't belong, it's just a flop,
pre-chorus
and I know it's a popular topping, I've heard it's quite the rage
but to me, it's a travesty, a culinary sacrilege
I mean, who needs sweetness on their pizza, it's just not right
give me a break, let's keep it real, no tropical delight
chorus
'cause there we are again, on that pizza floor

[Pre-Chorus]
you're telling me it's delicious, but I'm not sure

I remember it all too well, it's just not my scene

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again, on that pizza floor
you're telling me it's delicious, but I'm not sure
wind in my hair, I'm feeling quite peculiar
I remember it all too well, it's just not my scene
bridge
maybe we just have different tastes
maybe I'm just not adventurous enough

[Bridge]
but to me, pizza is a classic dish
it doesn't need a tropical twist
give me a break, let's keep it real
no pineapple on my pizza, that's the way it should be
verse 4
I know I'm not alone in this feeling
I know there are others who agree
pineapple on pizza, it's just not right
it's a crime against culinary humanity

[Verse 4]
I'll take my pizza the classic way
pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, olives, okay
no need for sweetness, no need for fruit
just give me the real deal, that's what I'll always choose
chorus
'cause there we are again, on that pizza floor
you're telling me it's delicious, but I'm not sure
wind in my hair, I'm feeling quite peculiar
I remember it all too well, it's just not my scene
