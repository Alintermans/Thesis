[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a problem
it's the pineapple on top
it's the laughter at a dinner
I should've scrapped it in the
if the flavors ever did speak
pineapple's not a mouthpiece
every bite's gettin' more bleak
a fresh disaster each week
we were born to love pizza
but pineapple's not the way
my taste buds offer no absolutes
she tells me, drop the pine
the only pizza I'll eat is
one without that fruit
I was born to love pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
a, amen
amen, amen

[Chorus]
take me to pizza
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that cheesy
good pizza, let me give you my life
take me to pizza
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that cheesy
good pizza, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
if I'm a fan of the good slices
my pizza's the sunlight
to keep the taste on my side
it demands a sacrifice
drain the whole sauce, get somethin' tasty
somethin' cheesy for the main course
that's a fine lookin' pie
what you got in the kitchen?
we've a lot of starvin' bellies
that looks tasty, that looks plenty
this is hungry work

[Chorus]
take me to pizza
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that cheesy
good pizza, let me give you my life
take me to pizza
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that cheesy
good pizza, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
no toppings or slices when the meal begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle cravings
in the madness and soil of that hot oven scene
only then, I am human, only then, I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh, oh, amen
amen, amen

[Chorus]
take me to pizza
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that cheesy
good pizza, let me give you my life
take me to pizza
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that cheesy
good pizza, let me give you my life
