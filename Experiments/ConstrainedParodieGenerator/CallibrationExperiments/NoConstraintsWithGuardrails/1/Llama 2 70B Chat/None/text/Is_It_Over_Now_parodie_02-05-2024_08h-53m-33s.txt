[Intro]
(is it? is it? is it? is it? is it?)

[Verse 1]
once the pizza was served, oh so fine
with the toppings of my heart's
I took a bite, oh what a crime
pineapple, you ruined the art

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later
I see your face in every pie
you dream of my taste buds, oh so bright
but pineapple, you're not invited, bye

[Chorus]
was it over when you put it on top?
was it over when my stomach dropped?
yuck, I whispered in disgust
pineapple, you're just not worth the fuss
was it over then? and is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(is it? is it? is it?)

[Verse 2]
when you added it to the menu, oh what a
red sauce, white cheese, and a lonely pe
blue hawaiian, oh how you confused me
your new pizza, it's just not my scene

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see
the pineapple on your pie?
there were flashin' lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my taste buds out of sight
only rumors of my delight
oh, lord, I think about jumpin'
off of very tall pizza piles
just to see you come runnin'
and say the one thing I've been wantin', but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later
if it's got pineapple, I won't be
you dream of my taste buds, oh so bright
but pineapple, you're not invited, bye

[Chorus]
was it over when you put it on top?
was it over when my stomach dropped?
yuck, I whispered in disgust
pineapple, you're just not worth the fuss
was it over then? and is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(is it? is it? is it?)
outro
(flashin' lights oh, lord oh)

[Bridge]
think I didn't see
the pineapple on your pie?
there were flashin' lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my taste buds out of sight
only rumors of my delight
oh, lord, I think about jumpin'
off of very tall pizza piles
just to see you come runnin'
and say the one thing I've been wantin', but no

[Outro]
(flashin' lights oh, lord oh)
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizzas later
I was hopin' you'd be there
and say the one thing I've been wantin'
but no
(was it? was it? was it? was it? was it? was it?)
