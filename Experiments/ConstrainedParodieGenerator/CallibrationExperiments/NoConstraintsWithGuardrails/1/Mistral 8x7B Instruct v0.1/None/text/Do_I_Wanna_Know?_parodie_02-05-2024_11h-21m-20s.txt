[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple quite vile?
does the thought of it on pizza make you cringe?
do you ever question the taste profile?
is your stomach turned by the sight of it?
do you think it's blasphemy,
a savory-sweet monstrosity?
I've had nightmares all week,
of pineapple ruining my feast,
an unforgivable mistake, a
terrible mistake to make.

[Pre-Chorus]
(should I give it a try?) would it be worth the while?
(sad to see you go) but pineapple's not worth the smile
(we both know) that pizza's meant for cheese and delight
not for something that ruins the taste of the night

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to you
ever thought of tryin' pizza without pineapple
when you're in the mood?
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
busy enjoyin' my pizza to
add something so crude
now, I've thought it through
crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
so do you have the guts?
to try pizza the right way, without pineapple's
insidious touch?
simmer down and take a bite,
pizza's not meant to be
a battleground of right and wrong.
but if you want, we could still get along.

[Pre-Chorus]
(should I give it a try?) would it be worth the while?
(sad to see you go) but pineapple's not worth the smile
(we both know) that pizza's meant for cheese and delight
not for something that ruins the taste of the night

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to you
ever thought of tryin' pizza without pineapple
when you're in the mood?
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
busy enjoyin' my pizza to
add something so crude
now, I've thought it through
crawlin' back to you

[Outro]
(should I give it a try?) would it be worth the while?
(sad to see you go) but pineapple's not worth the smile
(we both know) that pizza's meant for cheese and delight
not for something that ruins the taste of the night
(should I give it a try?) too busy enjoyin' my pizza to
sad to see you go, ever thought of tryin' without pineapple, darling?
(should I give it a try?) do you want me crawlin' back to you?
