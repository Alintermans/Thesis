[Intro]
is this a meal? is it just a farce?
caught in a scandal, can't escape the back
lash, open wide, take a bite and see
I'm just a foodie, I don't need your decree
verse 1

[Verse 1]
friends, just killed a pizza
put pineapple upon it, now it's blasp
hemy, friends had just begun
but now I've gone and ruined fun
friends, oh, didn't mean to make you sigh
if I'm not back with pepperoni this time tomorrow
carry on, carry on, as if nothing's changed

[Verse 2]
too late, my taste has gone
put pineapple upon it, now it's wrong
goodbye, pizza, I've got to go
gotta leave you all behind, and find the dough
friends, oh, no can do
pineapple's not for me and you
wish I'd never seen it on a pie

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little slice of shame
scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the same
thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
galileo, galileo, galileo, pineapple's
no, no,
spare us this sin, let it be
easy come, easy go, will you let me go
bismillah! no, we will not let you go
let it be, let it be, let it be
verse 4
verse 4
so you think you can serve me this mess
so you think you can disrespect the best
oh, baby, can't do this to
just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

[Verse 4]
(ooh)
(ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
nothing really matters, anyone can see
nothing really matters

[Outro]
(ooh)
(ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
pizza's not the same, anyone can see
nothing really matters to
me, to me, to
me, to me, to me.
