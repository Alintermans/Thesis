[Verse 1]
just a small-town pie, in a cheesy b
orn and raised in the oven, no place to be
tried to top it with pineapple, a mistake to be
deplored, it's a culinary decree

[Verse 2]
a slice in a greasy hand, the taste so bland
the sweetness of pineapple, a travesty planned
for a bite, they can't believe, it'
s a sin, it goes on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
foodies waiting
on the menu, for a better sight
their taste buds searching in the night
pizza purists, living just to find
a slice that's true, without the
pineapple grime

[Verse 3]
working hard to get a taste,
everyone wants a dish that's
first-class, paying anything to roll the dice
just one more time

[Verse 4]
some will win, some will lose,
some are born to sing the blues
oh, the dish is done, it's time to
choose, it goes on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
foodies waiting
on the menu, for a better sight
their taste buds searching in the night
pizza purists, living just to find
a slice that's true, without the
pineapple grime

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating
keep on critiquing
pizza purists, don't stop hating
keep on critiquing
pizza purists, don't stop hating
keep on critiquing
pizza purists.
note I tried my best to keep the syllable count, end rhyming, and pos-tag sequence the same as the original song while making the parody about why pineapple should not be on a pizza.
