[Intro]
I think i, I think I clearly
see the reason why pineapple'
should not be on a pizza pie
I'm convinced, don't you agree?

[Verse]
I've tasted sweet, I've tasted sour
pineapple's place, it has no power
oh, man, what a dish, the taste I miss
if I could spit it out, would i?
some bitter, some too sweet, some just right
but pineapple's place, it's just not nice
so leave it off, don't add it
or you'll regret it, I won't forget it
I've tasted sweet, I've tasted sour
pineapple's place, it has no power
oh, man, what a dish, the taste I miss
if I could spit it out, would i?
some bitter, some too sweet, some just right
but pineapple's place, it's just not nice
so leave it off, don't add it
or you'll regret it, I won't forget it

[Chorus]
don't add it, I won't forget it
don't add it, I won't forget it
don't add it, I won't forget it
don't add it, I won't forget it
outro

[Outro]
I've tasted sweet, I've tasted sour
pineapple's place, it has no power
oh, man, what a dish, the taste I miss
if I could spit it out, would i?
some bitter, some too sweet, some just right
