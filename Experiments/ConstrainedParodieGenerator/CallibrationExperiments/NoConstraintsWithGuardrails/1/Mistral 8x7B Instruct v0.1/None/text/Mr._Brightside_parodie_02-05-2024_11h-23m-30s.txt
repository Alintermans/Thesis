[Verse]
emerging from my den, with pineapple on my mind
had a plan, now it's gone, I should've declined
started with a slice, how did it end up like this?
(it was just a topping) it was just a dish
now I'm staring at the box, feeling quite a mess
while others savor the taste, I'm filled with distress
as they indulge in their feast, my stomach's
turning in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're praising the taste
while I'm stuck in the past
let me be
for I can't bear, this travesty
it's ruining pizza for me

[Chorus]
jealousy, turning fans into the fray
swimming through sick tropes
choking on your clichés
but it's just the price I pay
destiny's calling me
opening up my eager eyes
'cause I'm mr. pineapple denier

[Guitar Solo]

I never
