[Chorus]
when pineapple's on my pizza
I'm grumpier than ever
wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a strongly-word
ed letter to thee, mm-mm
do you read my rants?
or do you laugh at my rants?
when you said you'd try a slice or two
was I even on your plate?
I knew when I asked you to
be open-minded to what I was
tellin' you, you'd do the opposite
of what you said you'd do
and I'd end up more irked
don't say it's just a fad
you clearly weren't aware that you made me cringe

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on my pizza
I'm grumpier than ever
wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
you call me again, insistin' it'
s a tasty combo,
drivin' me up the wall, under the influence
of bad taste, you scared me to death
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'cause I'd never treat my pizza this way
you make me wanna throw it away

[Verse 3]
and I don't spread hate on the internet
never told anyone to disrespect
the sacred bond of cheese and bread
'cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
so don't defend your bad decision
and don't try to make me second-guess
my stance on pineapple, I could talk about
every time that you ruined my meal
but I'd have an empty line, cause you never failed
to disappoint me, that's

[Outro]
you ruined my favorite dish
always said you were within your right
to add your sweet abomination
just leave me and my pizza alone, yeah
(ah)
(goddamn)
(ah)
(pineapple, leave my pizza alone)
(pineapple, leave my pizza alone)
