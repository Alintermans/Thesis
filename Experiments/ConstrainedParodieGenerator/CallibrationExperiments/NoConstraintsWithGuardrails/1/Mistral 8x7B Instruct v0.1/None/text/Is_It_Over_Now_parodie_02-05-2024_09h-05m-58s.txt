[Intro]
(should it? should it? should it? should it? should it?)

[Verse 1]
when pineapple's on board (uh-huh)
with ham, it's quite a sight! ()
but still, it's never sworn
to grace a pizza night

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later
you'll see the mess that pineapple's left on your plate, dear
it's slimy, it's sweet, it doesn't
belong with mozzarella, baby

[Chorus]
was it wrong on a pizza pie?
did it ruin the margherita?
get this fruit away, I cried
in my dream as you took a bite, baby
was it wrong then? and is it wrong now?

[Post-Chorus]
(should it? should it? should it?)

[Verse 2]
when it's baked, it's not gold
it's just a yellow, soggy sight
burst bubbles, burnt cr
ust, it's just not right

[Bridge]
and did you think I'd like it?
there were groans and sighs
at least I had the sense
to keep my pizza nights pineapple-
free, only rumors
'bout my taste buds
and my dismay
oh, lord, I think about
tossing pineapple
far away, just to see

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred
pizza nights later, if you dare
you'll see the truth, that pineapple
doesn't belong anywhere, baby

[Chorus]
was it wrong on a pizza pie?
did it ruin the margherita?
get this fruit away, I cried
in my dream as you took a bite, baby
was it wrong then? and is it wrong now?

[Post-Chorus]
(should it? should it? should it?)
(should it? should it?)
bridge

[Bridge]
think I'd like it?
there were groans and sighs
at least I had the sense
to keep my pizza nights pineapple-
free, only rumors
'bout my taste buds
and my dismay
oh, lord, I think about
tossing pineapple
far away, just to see

[Outro]
(groans and sighs oh, lord oh)
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later
(groans and sighs) I was hoping you'd agree
and say the one thing
I've been wanting
oh, lord
but no
