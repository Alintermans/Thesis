[Verse 1]
25 years, and I've yet to find
a single slice with pineapple that's kind
on my taste buds, it's a sin,
I'd rather have a plain cheese thin.
pre-chorus

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes, it's a real pity
that pineapple's on pizza, such a pity
and i, I am feeling a little peculiar
and so I take a slice, and I take a bite
and I taste the mix, it's not right
and I say from the bottom of my heart
why put pineapple, what

[Chorus]
and I say, hey-ey-ey
hey-ey-ey
I said, hey, why pineapple?
and I say, hey-ey-ey
hey-ey-ey
I said, hey, why pineapple on my dish?

[Bridge]
ooh, ooh
ooh
ooh, uh huh
ooh, ooh
ooh
ooh, uh huh

[Verse 2]
and I try
oh my god, do I try
to avoid that fruit, oh my
in every pizza pie
and I pray
oh my god, do I pray
that chefs will hear me, come
on food revolution

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes, it's a real pity
that pineapple's on pizza, such a pity
and i, I am feeling a little peculiar
and so I take a slice, and I take a bite
and I taste the mix, it's not right
and I say from the bottom of my heart
why put pineapple, what

[Chorus]
and I say, hey-ey-ey
hey-ey-ey
I said, hey, why pineapple?
and I say, hey-ey-ey
hey-ey-ey
I said, hey, why pineapple on my dish?
and I say, hey-ey-ey
(wake in the morning and step outside)
hey-ey-ey
(take a deep breath and I get real high)
(and I scream)
I said, hey, a-what's going on?
and I say, hey-ey-ey
(wake in the morning and step outside)
hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah
(take a deep breath and I get real high)
(and I scream)
I said, hey, a-what's going on?

[Bridge]
ooh, ooh
ooh
ooh, uh huh

[Outro]
25 years, and my life is still
trying to find a pizza without that hill
of pineapple, it's a pain
