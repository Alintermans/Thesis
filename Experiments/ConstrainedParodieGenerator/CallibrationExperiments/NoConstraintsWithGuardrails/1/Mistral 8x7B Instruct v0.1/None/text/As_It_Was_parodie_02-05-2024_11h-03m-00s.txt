[Intro]
come on, crowd, we wanna say no way to

[Verse 1]
holdin' me down
sour taste is holdin' me down
I want you to hold pineapple away from your hand
why don't we leave it at that?
nothing to chew
when taste buds get in the way
seems you cannot replace
that bland taste, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
in this dish, it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this dish, it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was, as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
crowd, it's a culinary fall
why put pineapple on a pizza slice?
what kind of taste is that?
ringin' the bell
and nobody's coming to save
the pizza, it's so depraved
it just wants to know that you're brave, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
in this dish, it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this dish, it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was, as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home, get rid, taste sensation
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave pizza, two bites remain
I don't wanna talk about who's to blame

[Outro]
(hey)
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was, as it was
