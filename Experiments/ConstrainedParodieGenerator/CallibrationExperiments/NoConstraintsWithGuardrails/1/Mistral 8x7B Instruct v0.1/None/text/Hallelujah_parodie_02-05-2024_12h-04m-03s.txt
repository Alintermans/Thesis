[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite absurd
a pineapple on a pizza, oh lord
but you don't really care for this, do ya?
it's a crime, the fourth, the fifth
a taste that's bad, it's not a myth
the baffled chef making this monstros

[Chorus]
hallelujah, h

[Verse 2]
your taste was sound, but you tried it once
this sweet and savory mishmash, at once
it left you cold, you couldn't stomach this
it's a mess, the fourth, the fifth
a taste that's bad, it's not a myth
the baffled chef making this monstros

[Chorus]
hallelujah, h

[Verse 3]
you say it's fine, but you're in denial
it's not a meal, it's just a trial
the sauce and cheese can't hide the fail
it's a mess, the fourth, the fifth
a taste that's bad, it's not a myth
the baffled chef making this monstros

[Chorus]
hallelujah, h

[Verse 4]
I tried it once, it wasn't for me
I couldn't taste, so I tried to see
the truth is out, it's not a mystery
it's a mess, the fourth, the fifth
a taste that's bad, it's not a myth
the baffled chef making this monstros

[Chorus]
hallelujah, h
outro
hallelujah, h
additional lyrics
baby, I've been here before
I know this taste, I've walked this door
I used to eat alone before I knew you

[Outro]
hallelujah, h

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me, do you?
and remember when I tried it too
the taste was bad, it wasn't true
and every bite we chew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to judge a dish that's just a sh
and it's not a cheer that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
it's not a meal that you want to share
it's just a mess, it's not fair
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
outro
hallelujah, h
