[Verse 1]
grab some dough, and call your crew
it's a shame to add that forlorn fruit
the taste is odd, and simply rude
no way, I say, that works on wood

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no, oh no, oh no, so low
oh no, oh no, oh no, so low
oh no, oh no, oh no, so low
oh no, oh no, oh no

[Chorus]
with the heat off, it's less repuls
here we stand, now just reject us
we feel sane, and never puls
here we stand, now just reject us
a disdain, a disd
a disdain, a disdain

[Post-Chorus]
no way, no way, no way

[Verse 2]
I try hard, to keep it clean
and for this, I'll always lean
our gang's strong, we'll always
stand tall, till the very end

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no, oh no, oh no, so low
oh no, oh no, oh no, so low
oh no, oh no, oh no, so low
oh no, oh no, oh no

[Chorus]
with the heat off, it's less repuls
here we stand, now just reject us
we feel sane, and never puls
here we stand, now just reject us
a disdain, a disd
a disdain, a disdain

[Post-Chorus]
no way, no way, no way

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why it's there
oh yeah, I guess it's just not fair
I tried hard, it's hard to bear
oh well, whatever, just don't stare

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no, oh no, oh no, so low
oh no, oh no, oh no, so low
oh no, oh no, oh no, so low
oh no, oh no, oh no

[Chorus]
with the heat off, it's less repuls
here we stand, now just reject us
we feel sane, and never puls
here we stand, now just reject us
a disdain, a disd
a disdain, a disdain

[Outro]
a disdain, a disdain
a disdain, a disdain
a disdain, a disdain
a disdain, a disdain
a disdain.
