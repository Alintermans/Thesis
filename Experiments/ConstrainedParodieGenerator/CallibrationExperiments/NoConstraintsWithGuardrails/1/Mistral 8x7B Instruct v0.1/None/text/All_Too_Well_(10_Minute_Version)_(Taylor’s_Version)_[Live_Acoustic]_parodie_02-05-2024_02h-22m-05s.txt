[Verse 1]
I took a bite, it tasted wrong, the cheese was cold
but something in it made my stomach turn and growl
anchovies, mushrooms, and peppers I can tolerate
but pineapple on a pizza, that's a culinary

[Verse 2]
oh, the sweet and savory clash, a gastronomic mess
we're arguing in the kitchen, over slices of regret
the taste explosion, a disaster, not a symphony
and I can't help but think, it's just not meant to

[Pre-Chorus]
be on a pizza pie, it's a crime against the dough
and I might be okay, but my taste buds are in shock
oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again, that sweet and savory sin
pineapple chunks, a travesty, ruining every dish
the sauce, the cheese, the crust, all covered in shame
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
greasy box upon the counter, a stench fills up
the room, the sight of pineapple chunks makes me gag
and I can't help but wonder, why would anyone do this
to a perfectly good pizza pie, it's just not
pre-chorus
and I know it's long gone and
there's no way to fix this mess
and I might be okay, but my taste buds are in hell
oh, oh, oh
chorus
'cause there it is again, that sweet and savory sin

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again in the middle of the night
we're arguing in the kitchen, over slices of regret
the taste, the smell, the sight, all covered in shame
I remember it all too well
bridge
well, maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much

[Bridge]
but this thing was a disaster
'til you tore it all up
running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
verse 4
they say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
every time I think of pineapple on a pizza
it was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 4]
time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now I'm stuck with this memory, and I can't let it
verse 5
go, it's like a nightmare that won't end
pineapple on a pizza, it's a sin
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well, yeah
chorus
'cause there it is again when I loved pizza so

[Verse 5]
time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed
by the thought of pineapple on a pizza
it was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
outro
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well

[Chorus]
'cause there it is again, that sweet and savory sin
pineapple chunks, a travesty, ruining every dish
the sauce, the cheese, the crust, all covered in shame
I remember it all too well
spoken outro
I hate pineapple on pizza, you guys.
it's just not right.
I love you all so much.
thank you.

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at keeping quiet, but the punch line goes
I'll never eat pineapple on a pizza again
from the first time it happened, I knew it was
a mistake, a culinary sin, I'll never forget it
outro
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well
I remember it all too well

[Spoken Outro]
I hate pineapple on pizza, you guys.
