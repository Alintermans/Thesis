[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes, you
see, about the foods we eat
pineapple on pizza, boo
it's a culinary cheat
tastes like disappointment,
my friends, it's bittersweet
I won't be ordering that, no

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said, where d'you wanna dine?
how far will you regret?
I'm not looking for a dish
with pineapple to fret
just something tasty, please
a meal that I won't forget
a dish I can indulge in
and enjoy, no need to fret

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this
