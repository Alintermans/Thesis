[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise, I despise

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple's there
on pizza, it'
s just not fair
the taste it clashes
with marinara sauce
it's a shame,
it's such a loss
interlude mark hoppus
I despise, I despise

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise, I despise

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the ham?
and I'm so sorry
it's a travesty
this sweet and savory
contradiction
it's a mess,
a sticky situation
chorus tom delonge
don't add pineapple, it
doesn'
t belong

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
it's just a fruit,
it doesn't fit
I despise, I despise
instrumental break
chorus tom delonge mark hoppus
don't add pineapple, it

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
it's just a fruit,
it doesn't fit
I despise, I despise
outro mark hoppus
I despise, I despise
I despise, I despise
I despise, I despise
I despise, I despise
note I tried to keep the same syllable count, pos-tag sequence, and rhyme scheme as the original song while making a parody about why pineapple should not be on a pizza.

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise, I despise
I despise, I despise
I despise, I despise
I despise, I despise
