[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a problem
topped with pineapple, oh no
it's a travesty, everyone knows
a true abomination, better off without
if the pizza gods did speak
they'd ban this monstrosity for sure
it's a desecration
of a classic dish, it's
a culinary sin, you've heard
my pizza offers no delight
topped with fruit, it's just not right
it's a disgrace, I can't
bring myself to take a bite
I was a fan, but now I'm through
pineapple on pizza, just won't do

[Pre-Chorus]
a, no way
no way, no way

[Chorus]
keep pineapple far from me
offer me a slice that's pure and
free from fruit, it's just
not meant to be on pizza, that's for sure
keep pineapple far from me
offer me a slice that's pure and
free from fruit, it's just
not meant to be on pizza, that's for sure
verse 2

[Verse 2]
if I'm a lover of tradition
topped with cheese and tomato sauce
then pineapple has no place
on a classic pie, it's just a disgrace
drain the whole sea, get somethin' tasty
somethin' savory, not sweet
that's a fine lookin' slice
what you got on that plate?
we've got hungry mouths to feed
not a sweet tooth to be fed
this is serious business

[Chorus]
keep pineapple far from me
offer me a slice that's pure and
free from fruit, it's just
not meant to be on pizza, that's for sure
keep pineapple far from me
offer me a slice that's pure and
free from fruit, it's just
not meant to be on pizza, that's for sure
bridge

[Bridge]
no pineapple allowed when the feast
begins, a classic pie should never be disple
ased, there's no sweeter
taste than a classic pie, that's

[Pre-Chorus]
a, no way
no way, no way

[Chorus]
keep pineapple far from me
offer me a slice that's pure and
free from fruit, it's just
not meant to be on pizza, that's for sure
keep pineapple far from me
offer me a slice that's pure and
free from fruit, it's just
not meant to be on pizza, that's for sure
