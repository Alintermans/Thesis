[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, been a fool
been a hater, been a tool
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with pineapple on his plate
a culinary faux pas, he can't escape
on his breath's the smell, he just can't hide
a gastronomic sin, that just can't abide
it's a food fight, he's on the wrong side
a pineapple pizza, he just can't abide
he's lost his mind, he's lost his way
a gastronomic sin, he just can't repay

verse 2 eminem
a slice of heaven turned a crime
a sweet delight, now bitter bile
he's lost his taste, he'
s lost his way
a pineapple pizza, he just can't say

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, been a fool
been a hater, been a tool
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one-topping sin, turned a two
a sweet delight, now bitter bile
he's lost his taste, he's lost his way
a pineapple pizza, he just can't say
it's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and sue
don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
and now that I got you I don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do I do this dirt that I do?
get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'cause now with her in the womb
we can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
to use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, been a fool
been a hater, been a tool
all my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pineapple, my name's pizza
river run
call me pineapple, call me pizza
we'll let the river run
verse 3 eminem

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid, never the bride
a gastronomic sin, I just can't hide
a pineapple pizza, I just can't say
what else can I say, it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna eat this monst
