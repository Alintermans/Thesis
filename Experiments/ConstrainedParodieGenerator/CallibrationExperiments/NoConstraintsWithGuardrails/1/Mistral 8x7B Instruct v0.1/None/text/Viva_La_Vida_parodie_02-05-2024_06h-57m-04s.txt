[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice or
pineapple on pizza's
now it's gone, I can't ignore
this abomination's presence

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I thought it tasted nice
but now I see the error of my ways
the sweetness turns to ice
when mixed with cheese and tomato sauce
one bite, I felt the curse
of this sweet and savory curse
the toppings clash

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disgust
anti-pineapple activists
be my shield from this mess
my anti-pineapple protest
for some reason, I can't fathom
how this trend became a phenomenon
never again will I succumb

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a sick and twisted trend
that took my taste buds for a
shattered expectations and the sound of
gastronomic rebellion
purists wait

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disgust
anti-pineapple activists
be my shield from this mess
my anti-pineapple protest
for some reason, I can't fathom
how this trend became a phenomenon
never again will I succumb

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
(
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
)
hear the bells of disgust
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
anti-pineapple activists
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
be my shield from this mess
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
my anti-pineapple protest
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
for some reason, I can't fathom
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
I know my taste buds won't forgive
never a regretful
but that was when I had pineapple

[Outro]
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
mmm, mmm
