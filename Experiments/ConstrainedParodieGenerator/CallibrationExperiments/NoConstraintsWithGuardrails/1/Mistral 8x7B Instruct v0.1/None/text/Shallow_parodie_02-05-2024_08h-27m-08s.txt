[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something, friend
do you think pineapple on pizza should ascend?
or do you need more?
is there not another pizza to explore?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm appalled
at the thought of pineapple, I'm starting to brawl
for change
in the kitchen, I'll rearrange.

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something, mate
are you tired of the same pizza date?
or do you need more?
can't you see that pineapple is a bore?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
for a pizza without pineapple, I'm calling
for change
in the kitchen, I'll rearrange.

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I shun
pineapple on pizza, it's just not
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha-ha, shallow
in the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
in the sha-ha, shallow
we're far from the shallow now.

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh, ha, ah, ha
oh-ah, ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I shun
pineapple on pizza, it's just not
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha-ha, shallow
in the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
in the sha-ha, shallow
we're far from the shallow now.
