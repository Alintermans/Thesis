[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple, been a pizza
been a topping, been a fuss
all my toppings need cheese, feel it melting on me
well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is heat
the truth and my toppings now are sizzling like a treat
so let the oven run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's coming home with a heat wave, to catch some flack
sweat drips and sauce drips, mixed attack
on his breath's jack, he's a spice addict
and she just wants to exact revenge and get back
it's a pizza match, she's on his back like a pie
she's kept track of all his toppings
and guess who just happens to be moving on to the next
actually, just pepperoni on my last pizza and she has what my ex lacks
'cause she loves spice, psychopath
and you don't fuck with no man's pizza, even I know that
but she's devised some plan to top him in the crust
knife in hand, says their relationship's hanging by a string
so she's been on the web lately
says maybe she'll be my pepperoni, to spite her man
and I know she's using me to try to top him, I don't care
hi suzanne, but I shoulda said bye suzanne
after the first slice, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple, been a pizza
been a topping, been a fuss
all my toppings need cheese, feel it melting on me
well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is heat
the truth and my toppings now are sizzling like a treat
so let the oven run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one-topping turned a two-topping,
it was come crust, scram, now we huff, and...
he found out, now she feels topped and used
'cause he left, so what? he did it first to her too
now how am I supposed to tell this pizza that we're through?
it's hard to find the toppings, I'm aloof, nervous, and sue
don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the kitchen, like oven mitts
don't have to be reserved in a pie
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
irreversible, I preyed on you like it's pizza at the pie
and now that I got you I don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do I do this dough that I do?
get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burnin' the crust
'cause now with you in the oven
we can't bring you to this world, shoulda knew
to use toppings before I bit into your forbidden fruit
fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple, been a pizza
been a topping, been a fuss
all my toppings need cheese, feel it melting on me
well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is heat
the truth and my toppings now are sizzling like a treat
so let the oven run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's cheese, my name's sauce
pizza
(cheese)
, pizza run
call me pepperoni, call me mushroom
pizza, we'll let the pizza run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the topping, never the pie
fuck can I say? if life was a pizza
and toppings were an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
speeds at a high rate, like I'm swerving in five lanes
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my toppings straight
but I made you terminate my pizza
this pizza triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
what else can I say? it was fun for a slice
bet I really woulda loved your toppings
didn't really wanna crust, but fuck it

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pineapple, been a pizza
been a topping, been a fuss
all my toppings need cheese, feel it melting on me
well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is heat
the truth and my toppings now are sizzling like a treat
so let the oven run
I hope you enjoyed this parody! it was a lot of fun to write and I tried to stay true to the original song while incorporating the pineapple and pizza theme. let me know if you have any feedback or if you'd like me to write a parody for a different song.
