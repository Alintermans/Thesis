[Verse 1]
just a pineapple, livin' on a pizza
livin' in a world of cheese and sau
just a fruit, born and raised in a can
it's takin' over the pie, oh no!

[Verse 2]
a topping in a heat-packed o
the smell of sweetness, oh so great
for a bite, they can take the whole thing
it's growin' on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin'
up and down the pizza
their toppings searchin' in the night
cheese, people
livin' just to find flavor
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get a slice
everybody wants a taste
payin' anything to roll the dough
just one more topping

[Verse 4]
some will win, some will lose
some are born to be toppings
oh, the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin'
up and down the pizza
their toppings searchin' in the night
cheese, people
livin' just to find flavor
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop toppin'
hold on to that flavor
cheese, people
don't stop toppin'
hold on
cheese, people
don't stop toppin'
hold on to that flavor
cheese, people
