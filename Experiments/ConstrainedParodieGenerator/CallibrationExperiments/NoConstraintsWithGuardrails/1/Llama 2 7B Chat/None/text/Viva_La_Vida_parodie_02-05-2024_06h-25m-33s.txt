[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to crave the pineapple
on my pizza, it would be so sweet
but now I see the error of my ways
pineapple has no place on a pizza, it's a treat

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to think it was a tast
but now I know it's a crime
placing pineapple on a pizza, it's just not
right, it's a sin, it's a crime
chorus chris martin
I hear pineapple bells a-ringin'
pineapple cavalry choirs are singin'

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a-ringin'
pineapple cavalry choirs are singin'
be my pineapple, my sweet and sour
my topping in a foreign field
for some reason, I can't explain
I know saint pineapple won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when I ruled the world

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered pineapple and the sound of drums
people couldn't believe what I'd become
pineapple revolutionaries wait
for my pineapple on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
aw, who would ever wanna be king?

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a-ringin'
pineapple cavalry choirs are singin'
be my pineapple, my sweet and sour
my topping in a foreign field
for some reason, I can't explain
I know saint pineapple won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when I ruled the world

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
hear pineapple bells a-ringin'
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
pineapple cavalry choirs are singin'
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
be my pineapple, my sweet and sour
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
my topping in a foreign field
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
for some reason, I can't explain
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
I know saint pineapple won't call my name
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
never an honest word
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
but that was when I ruled the world

[Outro]
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
mmm, mmm
