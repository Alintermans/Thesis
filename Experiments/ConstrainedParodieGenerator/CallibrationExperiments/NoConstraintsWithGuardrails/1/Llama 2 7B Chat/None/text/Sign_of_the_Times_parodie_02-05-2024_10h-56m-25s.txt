[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a crime
don't put it on, it's not in rhyme
it's a topping that just doesn't belong
can't you see, it's a pizza, not a fruit song
just leave it off, it's a pizza
not a fruit, not a fruit

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn, we're stuck in this fight
why do we always put up a fight
it's a pizza, not a fruit, it's
right?
we never learn, we're stuck in this fight
why do we always put up a fight

[Chorus]
stop your crying, it's a pizza, not a fruit
we gotta get away from this topping
it's a pizza, not a fruit, it's
right?
stop your crying, it's a pizza, not a fruit
we gotta get away from this topping

[Verse 2]
pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a sin
don't put it on, it's not in
it's a topping that just doesn't fit in
can't you see, it's a pizza, not a fruit hit
just leave it off, it's a pizza
not a fruit, not a fruit

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn, we're stuck in this fight
why do we always put up a fight
it's a pizza, not a fruit, it's
right?
we never learn, we're stuck in this fight
why do we always put up a fight

[Chorus]
stop your crying, it's a pizza, not a fruit
we gotta get away from this topping
it's a pizza, not a fruit, it's
right?
stop your crying, it's a pizza, not a fruit
we gotta get away from this topping

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn, we're stuck in this fight
why do we always put up a fight
it's a pizza, not a fruit, it's
right?
we never learn, we're stuck in this fight
why do we always put up a fight

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough, about pizza toppings
we should open up, it's a pizza
before it's too late, will we ever learn?
it's a pizza, not a fruit, it's
right?

[Outro]
stop your crying, baby, it's a pizza, not a fruit
we gotta get away from this topping
it's a pizza, not a fruit, it's
right?
stop your crying, it's a pizza, not a fruit
we gotta get away from this topping
it's a pizza, not a fruit, it's
