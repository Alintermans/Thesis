[Intro]
I think i, I think I finally found
a reason why pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza, my dear
you see, it's not just a matter of taste,
it's a crime against humanity,

[Verse]
the sweetness clashes with the savory,
a flavor bomb that's just not worth the f
trouble,
and don't even get me started on the texture,
chewy and soggy, it's a pizza nightmare
chorus
in the oven, it'll burn,
in the oven, it'll burn
in the oven, it'll burn-urn-urn
in the oven, it'll burn
outro
so let's all agree,
let's all agree,
let's all agree,

[Chorus]
in the oven, it'll burn
in the oven, it'll burn
in the oven, it'll burn-urn-urn
in the oven, it'll burn
in the oven, it'll burn

[Outro]
pineapple on a pizza,
no, no, no, no,
it's a pizza sin,
it's a pizza
