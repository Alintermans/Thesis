[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a pizza, oh no
don't you know it's a crime
it's like puttin' ketchup on
a hot dog, it just ain't right

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
we're fallin'
in the pizza world, we're longin'
for the classic taste
and in the toppings, we're fear

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me somethin', boy
ain't you tired of the fad?
or do you need more?
ain't it hard keepin' it so trendy

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
we're fallin'
in the pizza world, we're longin'
for the real deal
and in the toppings, we're fear

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end, watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the cheese
crash through the crust where it can't be seen
we're far from the toppings now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
in the ha-ha, ha-la-la-la-low
in the ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
we're far from the toppings now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh, ha, ah, ha
oh-ah, ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end, watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the cheese
crash through the crust where it can't be seen
we're far from the toppings now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
we're off the deep end, watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the cheese
crash through the crust where it can't be seen
we're far from the toppings now
