[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a crime
gotta, gotta be kiddin' me, it's
it started out with a topping, how did it end up like this?
(it was only a topping) it was only a topping
now I'm feelin' sick, and my taste buds are cryin'
while mozzarella's makin' love, and pe
now they're goin' to the fridge, and my stomach's dyin'
and it's all in my mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
but mushrooms are takin' over, and onions too
takin' control, and it's all about you
let me go, and I just can't stay
'cause pineapple on a pizza, it's just not the way

[Chorus]
jealousy, turnin' pizza into a crime
swimmin' through toppings, it's all the time
chokin' on a pineapple, it's just not right
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin' me, open up my hungry eyes
'cause I'm mr. pizza

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
I'm comin' out of my cage, and I've been doin' just fine
gotta, gotta be kiddin' me, it's
it started out with a topping, how did it end up like this?
(it was only a topping) it was only a topping
now I'm feelin' sick, and my taste buds are cryin'
while mozzarella's makin' love, and pepperoni too
now they're goin' to the fridge, and my stomach's dyin'
and it's all in my mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
but mushrooms are takin' over, and onions too
takin' control, and it's all about you
let me go, and I just can't stay
'cause pineapple on a pizza, it's just not the way

[Chorus]
jealousy, turnin' pizza into a crime
swimmin' through toppings, it's all the time
chokin' on a pineapple, it's just not right
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin' me, open up my hungry eyes
'cause I'm mr. pizza

[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never
