[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza, oh what a sight
it's like a joke that never gets old, day or night
it's a topping that's just not right
can't you see it's a crime, a
pizza is for pepperoni and sausage
not for fruit that's sweet and fruity
it's a culinary sin
pineapple on a pizza, oh no, no, no
it's like a pizza without cheese, you know
how can you call it a pie, when it's missing the key
toppings that make it rise, you see
so come on, pineapple lovers, give it
up, let's keep it real, let's keep it pure
no pineapple on a pizza, that's for sure

[Pre-Chorus]
oh, oh, amen
amen, amen

[Chorus]
take me to the pizza parlor
I'll worship like a dog at the cheese and sau
I'll tell you my toppings, so you can sharpen your knife
offer me a pie that's worth my life
oh, good pizza, let me give you my strife
take me to the pizza parlor
I'll worship like a dog at the cheese and sauce
I'll tell you my toppings, so you can sharpen your knife
offer me a pie that's worth my life
oh, good pizza, let me give you my strife

[Verse 2]
pepperoni and sausage, that's the way to
go, they're the toppings that make me stay
on a pizza, they're the ones that make me sway
mushrooms and olives, they're okay, I guess
but they're no match for the toppings that make me bl
dance, they're no match for the toppings that make me
sway, they're no match for the toppings that make me
pineapple, oh no, no, no, no, no
it's like a pizza without cheese, you know
how can you call it a pie, when it's missing the key
toppings that make it rise, you see

[Chorus]
take me to the pizza parlor
I'll worship like a dog at the cheese and sauce
I'll tell you my toppings, so you can sharpen your knife
offer me a pie that's worth my life
oh, good pizza, let me give you my strife
take me to the pizza parlor
I'll worship like a dog at the cheese and sauce
I'll tell you my toppings, so you can sharpen your knife
offer me a pie that's worth my life
oh, good pizza, let me give you my strife

[Bridge]
no pineapple on a pizza, that's the way to be
keep it real, keep it pure, that's the way to
see, pineapple on a pizza, it's just not right
it's like a joke that never gets old, day or night

[Pre-Chorus]
oh, oh, amen
amen, amen

[Chorus]
take me to the pizza parlor
I'll worship like a dog at the cheese and sau
I'll tell you my toppings, so you can sharpen your knife
offer me a pie that's worth my life
oh, good pizza, let me give you my strife
take me to the pizza parlor
I'll worship like a dog at the cheese and sauce
I'll tell you my toppings, so you can sharpen your knife
offer me a pie that's worth my life
oh, good pizza, let me give you my strife
