[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's

[Verse 1]
don't put it on top, it's a crime
tastes so wrong, it's like a rhyme
can't you see, it's not in line
with the cheese and sauce, it's
chorus
in this pizza world, it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was

[Chorus]
in this pizza world, it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was, as it was
you know it's not the same
verse 2

[Verse 2]
don't even try, it's a lie
tastes so sour, it'll make you cry
can't you see, it's not a pie
it's a pineapple, oh no, it's
chorus
in this pizza world, it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was

[Chorus]
in this pizza world, it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was, as it was
you know it's not the same
verse 2

[Bridge]
go to the store, buy a new toy
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave the pineapple, it's a joke, oh boy

[Outro]
(hey)
pineapple on a pizza, no way
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was, as it was
