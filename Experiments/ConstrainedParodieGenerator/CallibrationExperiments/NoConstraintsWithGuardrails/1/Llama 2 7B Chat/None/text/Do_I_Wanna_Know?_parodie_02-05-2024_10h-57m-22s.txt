[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a crime
don't you know it's a flavor that doesn't rhyme?
it's like puttin' ketchup on a hot dog, it just ain't right
there's basil and mozzarella, that's the way it's meant to be
but pineapple, oh no, it's a pizza sin
pre-chorus
(do I wanna know?) if this topping flows like a river?
(sad to see it go) was sorta hopin' it'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the pizza was made for cheese and sauce

[Pre-Chorus]
(do I wanna know?) if this topping flows both ways?
(sad to see it go) was sorta hopin' it'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the pizza was made for cheese and sauce

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the kitchen
ever thought of takin' it off?
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too busy bein' wrong
to fall for a topping that don't belong
now I've thought it through
crawlin' back to the kitchen
verse 2

[Verse 2]
so have you got the guts?
been wonderin' if your taste buds are open?
and if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to mix it up
but pineapple, oh no, it's a pizza faux pas

[Pre-Chorus]
(do I wanna know?) if this topping flows both ways?
(sad to see it go) was sorta hopin' it'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the pizza was made for cheese and sauce

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the kitchen
ever thought of takin' it off?
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too busy bein' wrong
to fall for a topping that don't belong
now I've thought it through
crawlin' back to the kitchen

[Outro]
(do I wanna know?) if this topping flows both ways?
(sad to see it go) was sorta hopin' it'd stay
(baby, we both know) that the pizza was made for cheese and sauce
(do I wanna know?) too busy bein' wrong to fall
(sad to see it go) ever thought of takin' it off?
crawlin' back to the kitchen, darlin'?
