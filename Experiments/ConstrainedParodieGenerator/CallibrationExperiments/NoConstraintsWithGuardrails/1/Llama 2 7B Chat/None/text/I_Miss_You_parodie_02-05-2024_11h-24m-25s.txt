[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple, I miss pineapple

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello, there
the topping from my pizza nightmare
the fruit that doesn't belong
on a pie that's meant to be savory
we can live without the sweetness
and have a meal that's truly savory
and in the night, we'll wish this never ends
we'll wish this never ends
interlude mark hoppus

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple, I miss pineapple
I miss pineapple, I miss pineapple

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the cheese, where is the sauce?
I cannot eat this pizza without a cause
I need a topping that's more than just a
fruit that's been chopped up and thrown on top
like a afterthought, like a mistake
and as I stare, I count the slices
of cheese that are missing from the mix
like a puzzle that's not quite
complete, like a meal that's not quite right
will you come back and fix this pizza tonight?
fix this pizza tonight?

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple, you're already
the topping that's not wanted,
don't waste your time on pineapple, you're already
the topping that's not wanted,
instrumental break

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple, you're already
the topping that's not wanted,
don't waste your time on pineapple, you're already
the topping that's not wanted,
outro mark hoppus
I miss pineapple, I miss pineapple
I miss pineapple, I miss pineapple
I miss pineapple, I miss pineapple
I miss pineapple, I miss pineapple
in this parody, I've tried to maintain the same syllable count and rhyme scheme as the original song, while also making it clear why pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza. I've used similar language and imagery to the original, but with a new twist to fit the new topic.
please let me know if you have any other requests or if you want me to generate another parody!

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple, I miss pineapple
I miss pineapple, I miss pineapple
I miss pineapple, I miss pineapple
I miss pineapple, I miss pineapple
