[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the tales of pineapple on a
achilles and his gold
hercules and his gifts
spider-man's control
and batman with his fists
but pineapple on a pizza? no

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said, where d'you wanna go?
how much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for a topping
with some sweet and tangy gifts
some flavorful bliss
just something I can turn to
some savory delight
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh, I want something just like this
oh, I want something just like this
oh, I want something just like this
no pineapple on my pizza, please

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the stories of pineapple's fall
from the pizza toppings list
to the fridge's shelf
but pineapple on a pizza? no

I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh, I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh, I want something just like this
no pineapple on my pizza, please
