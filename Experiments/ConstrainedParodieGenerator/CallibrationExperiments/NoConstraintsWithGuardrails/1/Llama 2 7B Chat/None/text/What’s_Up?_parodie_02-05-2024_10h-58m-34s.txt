[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza, oh no
trying to make a topping go
for a flavor that's not quite right
I realized quickly when I knew I should
that pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza, it's
not part of the deal, it's not part of the

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out, what's in my head
and i, I am feeling a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lungs
don't put pineapple on a pizza, it

[Chorus]
and I say, hey-ey-ey
hey-ey-ey

ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
and I try, oh my god, do I try

and I pray, oh my god, do I pray
I pray every single day
for a pizza without pineapple, it's

and I scream from the top of my lungs
don't put pineapple on a pizza, it's

25 years and my life is still
trying to get up that great big hill of hope
for a pizza without pineapple, it's
