[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza, oh what a sight
it's like a crime against culinary might
can't you see it's just not right?
it's like a sin to put it on a pie
the cheese and sauce, they just don't mix
it's like a broken hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah, hallelujah
pineapple on a pizza, no way

[Verse 2]
you may think it's tasty,
but it's just not for me
I'll stick to the classic toppings, thank you
pepperoni and sausage, they're the key
it's like a holy grail,
a pizza without pineapple, that's the way

[Chorus]
hallelujah, hallelujah
pineapple on a pizza, no way

[Verse 3]
I know you may have your preferences
but pineapple just doesn't belong
it's like a sin to put it on a
pizza that's meant to be a delight
it's like a broken hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah, hallelujah
pineapple on a pizza, no way

[Verse 4]
I'll stick to the traditional toppings
and leave the pineapple for the smoothies
it's like a crime against pizza,
to put it on a pie that's meant to be
a delicious, cheesy, saucy delight
it's like a broken hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah, hallelujah
pineapple on a pizza, no way

[Outro]
hallelujah, hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
baby, I've been here before
I know this topping, I've walked this floor
I used to love pepperonI before I knew you
and I've seen your flag on the marble arch
love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me, do you?
and remember when I moved in you
the cheese and sauce, they just don't mix
it's like a broken hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a topping above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
