[Verse 1]
my lover's got a quirk,
she insists pineapple's the perk,
on a pizza's humble work,
I should've spoken up earlier in the dark.
if the foodies ever did decree,
pineapple's the last true decree,
every slice's gettin' more ble
ake, a fresh topping each week,
we were born picky, you heard them say it,
my kitchen offers no absolutes,
she tells me, 'serve it up with pine,
the only taste I'll be sent to,
is when I'm alone with pine.
I was born picky, but I love it,
command me to be open-minded.

[Pre-Chorus]
a, amen,
amen, amen.

[Chorus]
take me to the kitchen,
I'll top like a dog at the shrine of your whim,
I'll tell you my dislikes, and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death,
oh, good cook, let me give you my life,
take me to the kitchen,
I'll top like a dog at the shrine of your whim,
I'll tell you my dislikes, and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death,
oh, good cook, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the palate,
my lover's the pineapple gate,
to keep the gourmet on my side
she demands a debate,
chop the whole tree, get somethin' sweet,
somethin' spicy for the main course,
that's a fine lookin' high fruit,
what you got in the fridge?
we've a lot of starvin' foodies,
that looks tasty, that looks plenty,
this is hungry work.

[Chorus]
take me to the kitchen,
I'll top like a dog at the shrine of your whim,
I'll tell you my dislikes, and you can sharpen your knife
offer me my deathless death,
oh, good cook, let me give you my life,
take me to the kitchen,
I'll top like a dog at the shrine of your whim,
I'll tell you my dislikes, and you can sharpen your knife
offer me my deathless death,
oh, good cook, let me give you my life.

[Bridge]
no chefs or kings when the ritual begins,
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin,
in the madness and bowl of that sad culinary scene,
only then, I am human, only then, I am clean.

[Pre-Chorus]
oh, oh, amen,
amen, amen.

[Chorus]
take me to the kitchen,
I'll top like a dog at the shrine of your whim,
I'll tell you my dislikes, and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death,
oh, good cook, let me give you my life,
take me to the kitchen,
I'll top like a dog at the shrine of your whim,
I'll tell you my dislikes, and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death,
oh, good cook, let me give you my life
