[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret fruit,
pineapple, but it's not a sweet boon,
you don't really care for taste, do ya?
it goes like this, the sweet, the sour,
the bitter sting, the savory power,
the puzzled palate pondering, no pineapple, hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah

[Verse 2]
your cravings were strong, but you needed proof,
you saw it on the pizza, in the oven's proof
its beauty on the pie, it overthrew ya,
they sliced it up and served it hot,
they changed the dish, they changed the plot,
and from your plate they drew the hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah

[Verse 3]
you say I took the rule in vain,
I don't even know the rule,
but if I did, well, really, what's it to ya?
there's a harmony in every bite,
it doesn't matter which you sight,
the classic or the blended halleluj

[Chorus]
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah

[Verse 4]
I did my best, it wasn't much,
I couldn't taste, so I tried to touch,
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya,
and even though it all went wrong,
I'll stand before the lord of taste
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah

[Outro]
hallelujah, hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
baby, I've been here before,
I know this plate, I've tasted more,
I used to live alone before I knew you,
and I've seen your flag on the pepperoni arch,
love is not a victory dish,
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know,
what's really going on below,
but now you never show it to me, do you?
and remember when I moved in you,
the holy pepper was moving too,
and every bite we drew was hallelujah.

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above,
but all I've ever learned from love,
was how to argue with someone who outcooked you,
and it's not a cry that you hear at night,
it's not somebody who's seen the light,
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.
