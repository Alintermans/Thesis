[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the table,
feast would start when I gave the call,
now in the kitchen, I stand alone,
clear the plates I used to own.

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice,
feel the shock when pineapple met my eyes
listen as the crowd would groan,
now the old chef is dead, long live the
veggie pizza king.
one minute, I held the key,
next, the pineapple was added to me,
and I discovered that my pies

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
are built on foundations of despair,
pineapple's bitter taste in the air,
be my critic, my foe and scorn,
my toppings in a foreign form.
for some reason, I can't explain,
once you'd been added, there was never
never an honest taste,
and that was when I ruled the table.

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild choice,
brought the pineapple to destroy,
shattered flavors and the sound of sighs,
people couldn't believe what I'd devise.
pineapple revolutionaries wait,
for my dish on a silver plate,
just a chef on a lonely string,
aw, who would ever wanna be king?

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear jerusalem bells a-ringin',
pineapple choirs are singin',
be my critic, my foe and scorn,
my toppings in a foreign form.
for some reason, I can't explain,
I know saint peter won't call my name,
never an honest taste,
but that was when I ruled the table.

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
hear jerusalem bells a-ringin'
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
pineapple choirs are singin'
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
be my critic, my foe and scorn
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
my toppings in a foreign form
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
for some reason, I can't explain
(oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
I know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest taste
but that was when I ruled the table.
