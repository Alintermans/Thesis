[Verse 1]
first things first, I'll state my case so clear
pineapple on pizza, it just doesn't appear
I'm fired up and tired of this
food debate, oh-ooh, it's a dish, oh-ooh
food debate, oh-ooh

[Verse 2]
second things second, don't you impose your taste
pineapple on pizza, it's not a waste
I'm the one with the palate
I'll decide my plate, oh-ooh, it's my taste, oh-ooh
my taste, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was puzzled by the trend
adding pineapple to the end
writing my rant for the few
who share my view, took to me, shook at me, feeling me
singing from preference from the heart
taking my stand from the start
speaking my stance from the chart
seeing the flavor through the...

[Chorus]
pineapple! you change the, you change the
flavor, flavor
pineapple! you spoil the, you spoil the
dish, dish
pineapple! oh, let the opinions fly, oh, let them rain
my choice, my love, my preference, it came from
pineapple! you change the, you change the
flavor, flavor

[Verse 3]
third things third, let's give respect to tradition
pineapple on pizza, it's a tradition
all the hate that you've heard
has turned to love, oh-ooh, it's a tradition, oh-ooh
our tradition, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was skeptical at first
but now I've tried it
falling in love with the burst
of sweet and savory, it's my first, e
but
chorus

[Chorus]
pineapple! you change the, you change the
flavor, flavor
pineapple! you spoil the, you spoil the
dish, dish
pineapple! oh, let the opinions fly, oh, let them rain
my choice, my love, my preference, it came from

last things last, let's embrace the diversity
pineapple on pizza, it's a versat
by the grace of the food and the spice
you're the face of the future, oh-ooh, it's a versat, oh-ooh
our versatility, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
but now I've tried it, and I see
the joy it brings to me
it's not a limit, it's a key

[Chorus]
pineapple! you change the, you change the
flavor, flavor
pineapple! you spoil the, you spoil the
dish, dish
pineapple! oh, let the opinions fly, oh, let them rain
