[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, been a prankster
been a lover, been a joke
all my sins need pineapple, feel it ruining the flow
well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a culinary f
auxtit, then I'll just let it go
truth and my lies now are falling like a pineapple

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he orders a pizza, with a strange request
pineapple on top, it's just not the best
it's a taste clash, it's a textbook
pizza purists cringe, they just can't cope
it's a debate, they're on his back like
a relentless pineapple
they've kept track of his orders, and guess who
just happens to be ordering off the
menu, with a twist
'cause they love tradition, pizza purists
and you don't mess with a chef's design, even I know that
but she's devised some plan to add pineapple in
knife in hand, says our pizza's hangin' by
a thread
so she's been on the web lately
says maybe she'll be my pepperoni, to spite them all
and I know she's using me to try to play them, I don't care

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, been a prankster
been a lover, been a joke
all my sins need pineapple, feel it ruining the flow
well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a culinary f
auxtit, then I'll just let it go
the truth and my lies now are falling like a pineapple

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a classic margherita turned a hawaiian
it was come toppings, scram, now we hug tight, and...
he found out, now we feel betrayed and used
'cause he left, so what? he did it first to us
now how am I supposed to tell this group that we're through?
it's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and sue
don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
irreversible, I pineapple-ed on
and now that I got you I don't want you
took advantage in my craving to pursue
why do I do this act that I do?
get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
pineapple and cheese is burning the palate
'cause now with these toppings in
the oven, we can't bring it in, shoulda knew
to use sauce before I bit into your forbidden fruit
fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, been a prankster
been a lover, been a joke
all my sins need pineapple, feel it ruining the flow
well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a culinary f
auxtit, then I'll just let it go
the truth and my lies now are falling like a pineapple

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pineapple, my name's pineapple
river
pineapple, we'll let the river run
verse 3 eminem
always the bridesmaid, never the pineapple, hey!

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid, never the pineapple, hey!
fuck can I say? if pizza was a highway
and pineapple was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
but I made you terminate my baby
this love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
what else can I say? it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
what's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker, been a prankster
been a lover, been a joke
all my sins need pineapple, feel it ruining the flow
well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a culinary f
auxtit, then I'll just let it go
the truth and my lies now are falling like a pineapple.
