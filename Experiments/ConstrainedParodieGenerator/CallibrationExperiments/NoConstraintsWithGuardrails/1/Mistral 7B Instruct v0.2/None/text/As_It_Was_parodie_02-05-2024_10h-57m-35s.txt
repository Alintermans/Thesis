[Intro]
come on, pineapple, we wanna say goodbye to you

[Verse 1]
holdin' us back
pineapple on pizza, it's a mistake
I want you to slide off the plate, that's the fact
why don't we leave it at that?
no more taste
when texture clashes, it's a waste
it seems you cannot be replaced
and I'm the one who'll save, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
in this world, it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world, it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was, as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple, you're no good at all
why are you on my pizza, breaking the law?
ringin' my taste bud
and nobody's coming to save
my palate's daddy lives in delight
he just wants to know that it's right, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
in this world, it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world, it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was, as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go away, pineapple, spice up your
life, I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave the pizza, two toppings follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's ruining it first

[Outro]
(hey)
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was, as it was
