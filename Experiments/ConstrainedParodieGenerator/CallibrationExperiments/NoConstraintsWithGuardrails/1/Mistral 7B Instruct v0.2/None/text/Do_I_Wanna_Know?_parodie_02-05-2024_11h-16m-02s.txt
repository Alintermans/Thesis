[Verse 1]
have you got a pine in your eye?
do you ever get that fear that it's not worth the try?
that unwanted guest that ruins the pie?
are there some rules that say it's fine?
have you no idea that it's not divine?
I've dreamt about this debate nearly every night this pine
how many reasons can you find?
'cause there's this joke I found
that makes me think of pineapple on a pizza, oh so unrefined
until I fall asleep, spilling sauce on my new jeans

[Pre-Chorus]
(do I wanna know?) if this taste flows both ways?
(sad to see it go) was sorta hopin' it would fade
(pineapple, we both know) that the pizzas were mainly made
for savory toppings, not this debated

[Chorus]
scurrying back to pine
ever thought of calling when
you've had a few?
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
obsessed with tradition
to try something new
now, I've thought it through
scurrying back to pine

[Verse 2]
so have you got the guts?
been wonderin' if your palate's still open
and if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down and take a bite, I'm sorry to interrupt
it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to taste you
but I don't know if you feel the same as I do
but we could be harmonious if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
(do I wanna know?) if this taste flows both ways?
(sad to see it go) was sorta hopin' it would fade
(pineapple, we both know) that the pizzas were mainly made
for savory toppings, not this debated

[Chorus]
scurrying back to pine
ever thought of calling when
you've had a few?
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
stuck in my ways
to try something new
now, I've thought it through
scurrying back to pine

[Outro]
(do I wanna know?) if this taste flows both ways?
(sad to see it go) was sorta hopin' it would fade
(pineapple, we both know) that the pizzas were mainly made
for savory toppings, not this debated
(do I wanna know?) too stuck in my ways to change
(sad to see it go) ever thought of calling, darlin'?
(do I wanna know?) do you want me scurrying back to pine?
