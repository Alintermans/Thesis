[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with a slice, the air was filled with
the scent of cheese and pine, but something felt so ill
your pizza topped with pineapple, it just didn't seem right
and I left my taste buds at the door that fateful night

[Verse 2]
oh, the sweet combination of sauce and veggies galore
but the tangy pineapple ruins the savory core
autumn leaves falling down, but our meal'
s not falling into place

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's just a slice and
that taste is not here no more
but I can't help but cringe at the thought
oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little table
you almost choked on your drink, laughing at my disdain
pineapple in your eyes, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter, your face was turning green
you used to be a gourmet chef with a refined culinary scene
and your friends telling tales of your past creations so grand
you told me about your vision, thinking pineapple was your hand
and you were tossing me a slice, insisting it was a trend
but I was thinking on the drive home, any time now
he's gonna say it's a disaster, you never called it what it was
'til we were full and gone and left the table
check the toppings and come back swearing it's the
same
after three bites in the grave
and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
but all I felt was disappointment and you held my empty plate

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's just a slice and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the table in the refrigerator light
down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
sacred recipe and we'd swear
to remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
well, maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you topped it all up
running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to criticize
so casually rude in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all, all, all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
every time you serve me up a pineapple pie
you said if we had been more traditional, maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me, who was she?
a never-picky, ever-loving foodie whose taste reflects on you
not weeping in a party kitchen
some critic asking me what happened, you
that's what happened, you
you who charmed my taste buds with self-deprecating jokes
sipping wine like you're on a late-night show
but then I watched you watch the table all night, willing me to try
and he said, it's supposed to be fun, trying new things

[Verse 5]
time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
after pepperoni days and nights when you made me your own
now you serve me up plain and I eat alone
but you keep my old slice from that very first bite
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
pineapple in your eyes, I was there
you remember it all
down the stairs, you were there
you remember it all
it was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes
I'll get older, but your toppings stay the same
from when your pepperoni broke my taste buds and bones
I'm a foodie who's returning half my weight
and did the pineapple bruise paint you blue?
just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?
'cause in this kitchen's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
and how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
just between us, do you remember it all too well?
just between us, I remember it all, all, all
pineapple in your eyes, I was there, I was there
down the stairs, I was there, I was there
sacred recipe, I was there, I was there
it was rare, you remember it
pineapple in your eyes, I was there, I was there
down the stairs, I was there, I was there
sacred recipe, I was there, I was there
it was rare, you remember it
pineapple in your eyes, I was there, I was there
down the stairs, I was there, I was there
sacred recipe, I was there, I was there
it was rare, you remember it all too well
