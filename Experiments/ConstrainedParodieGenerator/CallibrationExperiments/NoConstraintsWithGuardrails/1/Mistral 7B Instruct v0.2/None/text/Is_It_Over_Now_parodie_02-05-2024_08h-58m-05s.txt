[Intro]
(is it? is it? is it? is it? is it?)

[Verse 1]
once the pine sat high, so ripe and bright,
but now it's on a pizza, oh, what a sight,
I savored every bite,
but now it's just not right

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizzas later,
pineapple on a pie, an unexpected flavor,
you dream of my pepperoni before it called you a traitor,
you search in every chef's kitchen for something greater

[Chorus]
was it over when they added the pine?
was it over when they sliced it so fine?
come here, I whispered in your ear,
in your dream as you passed out, dear,
was it over then? and is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(is it? is it? is it?)

[Verse 2]
when the cheese lost its control,
red sauce, yellow gold,
pineapple on a roll,
your new dish is my mold

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you?
there were flashin' lights,
at least I had the decency,
to keep my pies out of sight,
only rumors about my toppings and spices,
and my whispered sighs,
oh, lord, I think about ordering,
off of very strange pizzas,
just to see you come running,
and say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza parties later,
if it's got pineapple, I will surmise that you'll probably order it,
you dream of my pepperoni before it called you a traitor,
you search in every chef's kitchen for something greater, dear

[Chorus]
was it over when they added the pine?
was it over when they sliced it so fine?
come here, I whispered in your ear,
in your dream as you passed out, dear,
was it over then? and is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(is it? is it? is it?)
(is it? is it?)
bridge
think I didn't see you?

[Bridge]
there were flashin' lights,
at least I had the decency,
to keep my pies out of sight,
only rumors about my toppings and spices,
and my whispered sighs,
oh, lord, I think about ordering,
off of very strange pizzas,
just to see you come running,
and say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(flashin' lights oh, lord oh)
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizzas later,
(flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there,
and say the one thing,
I've been wanting,
but no
(was it? was it? was it? was it? was it? was it?)
