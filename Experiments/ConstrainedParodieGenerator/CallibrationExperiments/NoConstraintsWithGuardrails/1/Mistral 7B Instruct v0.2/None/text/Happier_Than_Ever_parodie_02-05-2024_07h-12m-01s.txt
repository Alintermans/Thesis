[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on top
I savor every morsel, I'm poppin'
wish I could explain it better
pineapple on pizza, it's such a blunder

[Verse 1]
give me a slice or two to ponder something clever
to write myself a letter
to tell me what to serve, mm-mm
do you read my surveys?
or do you ignore my savory allure?
when you said you'd try it, passing through
was I even on your plate?
I knew when I asked you to
be cool about what I was suggestin'
you'd do the opposite of what you'd vow
and I'd end up more averse
don't say it's a cure
you clearly weren't aware that you made me curse
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on top
I savor every morsel, I'm poppin'
wish I could explain it better
pineapple on pizza, it's such a blunder, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
you call me again, drunk on your pine
drivin' home with a
pineapple in your pine
you sickened me to death, but I'm
wastin' my breath
'cause you only listen to your taste bud
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no

[Verse 3]
I don't talk shit about pineapple on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's just embarrassing, it was my everything
and all that it did was make me feel sad
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line because you never did
never paid any mind to my palate or friends, so I
shut them all out for you because I was a kid

[Outro]
you ruined all my favorite
dishes, always said you were misunderstood
made all my meals your own
just pineapple away, yeah
(pineapple
goddamn)
(pineapple)
(pineapple)
(pineapple)
