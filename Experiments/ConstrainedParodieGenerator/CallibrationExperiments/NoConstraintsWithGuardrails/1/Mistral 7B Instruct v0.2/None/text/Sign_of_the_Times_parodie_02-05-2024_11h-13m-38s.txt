[Verse 1]
just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times,
pineapple on pizza, a culinary crime,
put on your palate's best disguise,
you can't bribe my taste buds on your way to the sky,
it looks quite odd down here,
but it's not really good,

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn, we've been here before,
why are we always stuck with this pineapple lore,
the taste, the taste?
we never learn, we've been here before,
why are we always stuck with this pineapple lore,
the taste, the taste?

[Chorus]
just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times,
we gotta get away from this dish,
we gotta get away from this dish,
just stop your whining, it'll be alright,
they told me that the end is near,
we gotta get away from this dish

[Verse 2]
just stop your whining, savor the taste of your life,
rising above the savory strife,
pineapple on pizza, it's not right,
remember every bite will be alright
we can meet again somewhere,
somewhere far away from this dish,

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn, we've been here before,
why are we always stuck with this pineapple lore,
the taste, the taste?
we never learn, we've been here before,
why are we always stuck with this pineapple lore,
the taste, the taste?

[Chorus]
just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times,
we gotta get away from this mess,
we gotta get away from this mess,
stop your whining, baby, it'll be alright,
they told me that the end is near,
we gotta get away from this mess

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn, we've been here before,
why are we always stuck with this pineapple lore,
the taste, the taste?
we never learn, we've been here before,
why are we always stuck with this pineapple lore,
the taste, the taste?

[Bridge]
we don't mix enough, we should open up,
before our taste buds are overwhelmed, will we
ever learn? we've been here before,
it's just what we know,
outro

[Outro]
stop your whining, baby, it's a sign of the times,
we gotta get away,
we got to get away, we got to get away
we got to, we got to, away
we got to, we got to, away
we got to, we got to, away.
