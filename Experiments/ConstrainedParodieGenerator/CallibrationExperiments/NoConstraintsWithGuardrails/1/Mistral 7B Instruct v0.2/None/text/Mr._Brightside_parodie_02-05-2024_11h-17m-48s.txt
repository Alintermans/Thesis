[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge, pineapple's been my bane
gotta, gotta be sane, no place on a pizza
it started out so sweet, how did it end up so
(it was just a topping) it was just a topping
now I'm watchin' it bake and my stomach's in pain
while they're savouring their slice, it's such a shame
now they're diggin' in deep and my taste buds rec
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savouring each bite, relishing the taste
he's enjoying his meal, while I'm feeling the waste
let me go
'cause I just can't partake, it's driving me mad
and takin' control

[Chorus]
pineapple, turnin' palates into the sea
swimmin' through savory lullab
yuckin' on your alibis
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin' me
open up my eager eyes
'cause I'm mr. disappointed

[Outro]
I never, I never,
I never, I never,
I never, I never,
I never wanted that pineapple on my pizza.
