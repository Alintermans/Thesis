[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old,
the legends and the lore,
pineapple on a pizza,
that's a tale that's never bore.
anchovies and their roll,
peppers and their spice,
but I'm not the type who'd add that to my slice

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said, where d'you wanna go?
how much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for a pie,
with an unexpected twist,
some exotic fruit,
a culinary bliss,
just something I can turn
to, somebody I can miss

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this,
I want something just like this,
verse 2 chris martin
I've been reading books of old,
the legends and the lore,
pineapple on a pizza,
that's a tale that's never bore.
pepperoni and their roll,

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
mushrooms and their spice,
but I'm not the type who'd add that to my life
pre-chorus chris martin
she said, where d'you wanna go?
how much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for a dish,

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
with an unexpected twist,
some exotic fruit,
a culinary bliss,
just something I can turn to,
somebody I can miss
chorus chris martin
I want something just like this,

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this,
I want something just like this,

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh, I want something just like this,
doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo,
doo-doo-doo, doo, doo,
doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo,
oh, I want something just like this,
doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo,
doo-doo-doo, doo, doo,
doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo.

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go?
how much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for a pie,
with an unexpected twist,
some exotic fruit,
a culinary bliss,
just something I can turn to,
somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this.

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh, I want something just like this,
oh, I want something just like this,
oh, I want something just like this.
