[Verse 1]
just a small-town guy, livin' in a silly world
he found a pineapple on his pizza pie
a city girl, born and raised in tropical lands
she served him up a dish that drove him mad

[Verse 2]
a chef in a bustling kitchen
the taste of pineapple, an unexpected stink
for a groan, they share the strange delight
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
diners frowning
up and down the food aisle
their faces pondering in the night
pizza boxes, people
living just to find a taste
hiding somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
trying hard to get it right
everybody hates a pineapple bite
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more time

[Verse 4]
some will cheer, some will boo
some are born to eat the pineapple blues
oh, the culinary nightmare goes on
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
diners frowning
up and down the food aisle
their faces pondering in the night
pizza boxes, people
living just to find a taste
hiding somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop tasting
hold on to that hating
pizza boxes, people
don't stop tasting
hold on
pizza boxes, people
don't stop tasting
hold on to that hating
pizza boxes, people
