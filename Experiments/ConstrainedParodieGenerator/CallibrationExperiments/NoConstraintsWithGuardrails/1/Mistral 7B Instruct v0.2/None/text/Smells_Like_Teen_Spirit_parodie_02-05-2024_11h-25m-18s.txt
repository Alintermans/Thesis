[Verse 1]
load up on pizzas, bring your crew
it's fun to bicker and to muse
she insists on pineapple's allure
oh no, I know a disgusting lure

[Pre-Chorus]
hello, hello, hello, how low
hello, hello, hello, how low
hello, hello, hello, how low
hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings out, it's less tasty
here we are now, appalled and vexed
I feel disgusted and contagious
here we are now, appalled and vexed
a monstrosity, a
an anomaly, my appetite

[Post-Chorus]
yum, yuck, yum

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I choose
and for this choice, I feel confused
our little group has always been
and always will, until we've seen

[Pre-Chorus]
hello, hello, hello, how low
hello, hello, hello, how low
hello, hello, hello, how low
hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings out, it's less tasty
here we are now, appalled and vexed
I feel disgusted and contagious
here we are now, appalled and vexed
a monstrosity, a
an anomaly, my appetite

[Post-Chorus]
yum, yuck, yum

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I crave
oh yeah, I guess it makes me cringe
I found it hard, it's hard to find
oh well, whatever, let it slide

[Pre-Chorus]
hello, hello, hello, how low
hello, hello, hello, how low
hello, hello, hello, how low
hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
with the toppings out, it's less tasty
here we are now, appalled and vexed
I feel disgusted and contagious
here we are now, appalled and vexed
a monstrosity, a
an anomaly, my appetite

[Outro]
a denial, a den
a denial, a den
a denial, a den
a denial, a den
a denial, a denial.
