[Verse 1]
25 slices, and my pizza's still
tryin' to find a place where pineapple doesn'
t chill
on my plate, I ponder
why this topping's such a blunder
but the world of food is made up of this

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm taking a bite
just to get it all out, what's in my sight
and i, I am feeling a little peculiar
and so I take a slice and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's this fruit doing here

[Chorus]
and I say, hey-ey-ey
hey-ey-ey
I said, hey, why's pineapple on my pie?
and I say, hey-ey-ey
hey-ey-ey
I said, hey, why's this fruit ruining my guy?

[Bridge]
ooh, ooh
ooh
ooh, uh huh
ooh
ooh, uh huh

[Verse 2]
and I try, oh my god, do I try
I try all the time
to remove this topping from my dish
but it clings
and I pray, oh my god, do I pray
I pray every single day
for a change, for a better way
to enjoy my meal without this fuss

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm taking a bite
just to get it all out, what's in my sight
and i, I am feeling a little peculiar
and so I take a slice and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's this fruit doing here?

[Chorus]
and I say, hey-ey-ey
hey-ey-ey
I said, hey, why's pineapple on my pie?
and I say, hey-ey-ey
hey-ey-ey
I said, hey, why's this fruit ruining my guy?
and I say, hey-ey-ey
(take a slice and step outside)
hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah
(take a deep breath and I get real high)
(and I scream)
I said, hey, why's pineapple on my pie?
and I say, hey-ey-ey
(take a slice and step outside)
hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah
(take a deep breath and I get real high)
(and I scream)
I said, hey, why's pineapple on my pie?

[Bridge]
ooh, ooh
ooh
ooh, uh huh

[Outro]
25 slices, and my pizza's still
tryin' to find a place where pineapple doesn't chill
on my plate, I ponder
