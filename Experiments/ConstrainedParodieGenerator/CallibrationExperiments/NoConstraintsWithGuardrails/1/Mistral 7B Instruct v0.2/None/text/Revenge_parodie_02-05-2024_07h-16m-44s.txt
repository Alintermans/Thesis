[Intro]
I think i, I think I finally
found a reason to stand firm
against that fruit on my pizza pie,
pineapple, it just doesn't conform
you agree?

[Verse]
I've ordered pies with ham and bacon,
peppers, onions, and olives, I've taken
but pineapple, oh, the things I've taken
it's a topping that just doesn't make it
oh, man, what a world, the tastes I've t
asted, if I could act on my disdain, no, would i?
well, ruined pies ruin meals, so order fast
and I don't wanna let it go, so in my freezer, it'll last

[Chorus]
in my freezer, it'll last
in my freezer, it'll last
in my freezer, it'll last-ast-ast
in my freezer, it'll last
in my freezer, it'll last-ast-ast
in my freezer, it'll last

[Outro]
in my freezer, it'll last
it'll last, it'll last, it'll last
is my dislike your preference?
is all of my dislike your preference?
enjoy.
