[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something, friend,
is pineapple on your pizza a trend?
or do you need more?
it's an enigma, that topping'

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm pining
in all the good bites, I find myself whining
for change
and, in the bad slices, I fear the taste

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something, pal,
are you tired of this pineapple call?
or do you need more?
it's a mystery, that topping's toll

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm pining
in all the good bites, I find myself whining
for change
and, in the bad slices, I fear the taste

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they can't sting us
we're far from the pepperoni now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha-ha, sha-hallow
in the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
in the sha-ha, sha-hallow
we're far from the pepperoni now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh, ha, ah, ha
oh-ah, ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they can't sting us
we're far from the pepperoni now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha-ha, plain
in the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
in the sha-ha, plain
we're far from the pepperoni now
