[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise? or just a silly fad?
topped with pineapple, no escape from this madness,
open your eyes, look up to the pie and see,
I'm just a picky eater, I need no
commiseration, because I've got a strong disdain,
any way the toppings blend, doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
papa, just spoiled a dish,
placed a pineapple ring right in the middle, dish
papa, pizza had just begun,
but now I've gone and ruined it all, all
papa, ooh, didn't mean to make you sigh,
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late, my taste buds have spoken,
sends shivers down my tongue, palate's aching all the time,
goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
gonna leave you all behind and face the truth,
papa, ooh, I don't wanna pine,
I don't wanna pine for a slice that's not

[Verse 3]
I see a little round pizza top,
pineapple, pineapple, will you ruin my supper?
thunderbolt and vinegar, very, very unappetizing
(gourmet) gourmet, gourmet, gourmet
but I'm just a picky eater, nobody loves me
he's just a picky eater from a picky family
spare him his slice from this monstrosity
pineapple, pineapple, will you let me go?
bismillah! no, we will not let you go
(let it go) bismillah! we will not let you go
(let it go) bismillah! we will not let you go
(let me go) will not let you go
(let me go) will not let you go
(never, never, never, never let me go) ah
no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) mamma mia, let me go
beelzebub has a topping put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
so you think you can serve me with a pineapple surprise?
so you think you can love me and leave me to pine?
oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]
(ooh)
(ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
nothing really matters, anyone can see
nothing really matters
nothing really matters to me
any way the toppings blend
