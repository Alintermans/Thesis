[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine, I pine

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello, there, my friend
the fruit on my pizza, an unwelcome trend
the topping in the kitchen, out of place
pineapple on a pie, such
a culinary mistake
we can live like cheese and sauce if we want
where you can always find me
but please, no pineapple, let's agree
in the night, we'll wish this never ends
we'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine, I pine
I pine, I pine

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the harmony, and I'm so sorry
I cannot taste, I cannot savor tonight
I need some balance, and always
this sweet, strange intrusion
comes creeping on, so
disrupting every bite
and as I chew, I ponder
the juxtaposition of flavors
like indecision to order
and hear the voice of tradition
will you come clean and save me tonight?
save me tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me, it's already
the flavor inside my head
don't add your fruit to me, it's already
the flavor inside my head

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me, it's already
the flavor inside my head
don't add your fruit to me, it's already
the flavor inside my head
don't add your fruit to me, it's already
the flavor inside my head
don't add your fruit to me, it's already
the flavor inside my head
don't add your fruit to me, it's already
the flavor inside my head

I pine, I pine
I pine, I pine
I pine, I pine

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine, I pine
I pine, I pine
I pine, I pine
I pine, I pine
