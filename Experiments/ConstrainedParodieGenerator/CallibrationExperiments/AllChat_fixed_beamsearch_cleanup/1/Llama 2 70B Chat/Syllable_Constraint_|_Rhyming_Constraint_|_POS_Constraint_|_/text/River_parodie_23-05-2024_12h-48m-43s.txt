[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater, been a fool
Been a critic, been a rule
All my complaints need some cool water, feel it washing over
Well, little pizza, I don't want to admit to thing
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the pineapple

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've been a pizza lover, always on the
Search for the perfect slice, neverb
But then I met a topping, it was
Pineapple, and my world was shaken, itascae e
She said she was different, unique andorrae be
But to me, she was just a blasphemy
I tried to give her a chance, but it was clear to seee ee
She didn't belong on my pizza, it was a travesty ee eee
Now I know what you're thinkingre
Why can't pineapple be on a pizza, it's not a
Crime, it's just a topping, like any other ree
But to me, it's a sin, a culinary abomind
Like putting ketchup on a steak
Or wearing socks with sandals, it's just not right ee ee
So I'll keep my pizza pure, no pineapple in sightreee ee ee e
And if you don't like it, well, that's your pri
But to me, it's the only way, it's the

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater, been a fool
Been a critic, been a rule
All my complaints need some cool water, feel it washing over
Well, little pizza, I don't want to admit to thing
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the pineapple

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I know you think I'm crazy, a purist
But to me, it's all about the taste, it's a must
I can't compromise, it's not in my veins
I'll take my pizza with pepperoni, saus
Age, mushrooms, onion, and olives, that's my jam inlaws
But pineapple, it's a no go, it's notworth inlaws
It's like putting ranch on a pizza, it's just not the same
And don't even getmestarted on hawaiian pizza, it's applause
That's like putting ketchup on a hot dog, it's just not right ee ee ee
So keep your pineapple, I'll stick aflame
My pizza, my rules, it's the only way it's ever
Gonna be, it's the only way it's ever been e guffaws
And if you don't like it, well, that outlaws
Is up to you, but to me, it's chainsaws
It's the only way, it's them mccaww laws
It's the only way, it's the only way ee ee
Ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee
Ee ee ee ee ee ee
Ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee because
It's the only way, it's the only way ee ee ee ee ee

I've been a hater, been a fool
Been a critic, been a rule
All my complaints need some cool water, feel it washing over
Well, little pizza, I don't want to admit to thing
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the pineapple

I know you think I'm crazy, a hater
But to me, it's all about theater

Must, it's the only way, it's the only feature ee
