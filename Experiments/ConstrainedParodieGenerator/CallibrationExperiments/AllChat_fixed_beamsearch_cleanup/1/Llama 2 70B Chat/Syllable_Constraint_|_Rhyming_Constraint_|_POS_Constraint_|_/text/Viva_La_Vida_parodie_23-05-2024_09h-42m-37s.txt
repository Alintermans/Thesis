[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza
Toppings would shine so bright and clear
Now it's just a sad, sad sight a lon
Sauce and cheese, they donilon

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to be the king
Of the pizza, I'd order with ease
But now they've taken my crown
Pineapple, it's just not worth the crosstown
I hear the toppings, they're a
Ringin' in my ear, aka
But I can't, I won't come near, a
Pizza with pineapple, it's just not dear uh

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the oven, it's a bakin' (ding
Roman pizza, it's a fakin' (ding
Be my pepperoni, my saus
My mushrooms, they're a causin' (ding inlaws
For some reason, I can't explai
Why pineapple has a place
But that's when pizza was
A delicious, tasty dish (ding

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
It was a wicked and wild crave
Pineapple on pizza, it's a
Blew down the doors, let the haters in
Shattered toppings, and the sound of drums (ding
People couldn't believe what
I'd become, a pineapple nut
Revolutionaries wait, for a bite (ding
Of pizza, without the pine, it's right

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the oven, it's a bakin' (ding
Roman pizza, it's a fakin' (ding
Be my pepperoni, my saus
My mushrooms, they're a causin' (ding inlaws
For some reason, I can't explai
Why pineapple has a place (ding why? (ding
But that's when pizza was
A delicious, tasty dish (ding
