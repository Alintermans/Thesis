[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria, the ache
Was in my stomach, it was plain to see. said
But something about the menu felt like a
Crime, and I knew exactly what it beckstead

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet toppings, they were a sight to see, taste buds
Dancing in my mouth, a flavor symphony
But then I saw it, and my heart did sink, like a
Pineapple on a pizza, oh how it bloods

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's not right, and
It's ruining the taste, its
A culinary crime, and I can't ignore
The thought ofthe

[Chorus]
Pineapple on a pizza, why'd you do it
It's a sin, a travesty, a pizza ruiner, dude. it' s
Leave pineapple where itbel
Ongs, in fruit salad, not onmy

[Verse 3]
Papa john's or pizza hut, it don't matter the name
If it's topped with pineapple, it's all the same, game over, mane aflame
And don't even get me started on ham and pineapple
It's like someone took a bite of paradise and said
Screw it, I'll just spit it back out and call it a pizza head
Garnish it with a sprig of rosemary, a drizzl
Of balsamic, it's still an abomination, dont
You see, pizza is a work of art, a masterpiece, perfe
Don't go and ruin it withs
Something as vulgar as pineapple, it's just
Not worth the calories, the
Thought of it is just too much to bear, it's like nails on a
Chalkboard, a pizza that's just not worth the dishonest

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's not right, and
It's ruining the taste, its, a
Culinary crime, and I can't, not
The thought of it, pineapple to

[Chorus]
Pineapple on a pizza, why'd you do it, it
It's a sin, a travesty, a pizza ruiner, du ehrett
Leave pineapp le where it
Belongs, in fruit salad, not on
My pizza, it's just not right, it's just not right, it's justt
Not right, pineapple on a pizza, just not right. it's just
Not right, pineapple get
Out of my pizza, it's just not right

[Bridge]
Maybe we lost our way, in a haze
Of culinary madness
Maybe we just need a break, from the norms
But pinepple, it's just
Not the answer, it's just
Not the solution, it's just not
The way, pineapple, it's just not right. it's just not right. it's just
Not right, pineapple, it's just not right. it's just not right. it's just
Not right, pineapple, it's just not right. it's just not
Right, pineapple, it's just not right

[Verse 4]
I remember the first time, I had a slice, so fine
Pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, it was
Heavenly, but then you had to go and ruin it with pineapple
It's like you took a dump on
My culinary dreams, it's just not right, it
It's just not right, pineapple, it's just not right. it's just not right, it's just not
Right, pineapple, it's just not right. it
It's just not right, pineapple, it's just not
Right, ppineapple, it .dot
It's just not right, pineapple, it's just not right
It's just not right, pineapple, it's just not right, it
It's just not right, pineapple, it's just not right, it's just not right, it
It's just not right, pineapple, it's just not right, it's just not

[Verse 5]
Time won't change, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After pineapple days and nights when you made me your
Own, now you're just a memory, and I rossmore
But you keep my old pizza, it reminds you of
Innocence, and it smells like victory, it's just not
Right, pineapple, just smurfit
It's just not right, pineapple, it's just

[Chorus]
Pineapple on a pizza, why'd you do
It's a sin, a travesty, a pizza ruiner, du
It's just not right, pineappl

On my pizza, it's just al
It's just not right, pineappl
E get out of my hal
Pizza, it's just not al
It's just not right, pineappl
E, it's just not right, it's just not

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes
Pineapple on a pizza, it's a joke, it
It's just not funny, it's just not right, it
It's just not right, pineapple, it's just not right
It's just not right, pineapple, it's just
Not the way, pineapple, it's just not right pinkest
Island, it's just not right. it
It's just not right, pineapple, it's just not
Right, pineapple, it's just not right
It's just not right, pineapple quite

[Outro]

Just between us, do you remember it all soyuz
Just between us, I remember it (just between us), all sofas
