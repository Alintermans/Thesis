[Verse 1]
First things first
I'ma say what's on my mind, it's time to
Set the record straight, it's time to
Talk about pineapple on ap
Izza, it's just not right, yonhap

[Verse 2]
Second things second
Don't you tell me what I should desire, it
Pineapple on pizzas
Is a crime, it's a burning fire
A travesty, a cullipher

[Pre-Chorus]
I was taken aback, I wassh
By the thought of it, it's just not class
Taking my tastebuds for a
Ride, it's just not right, it's a masquerade. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (repeat as

[Chorus]
Pineapple! you made me say, you made
Me disbelieve, disbelie
Ver! pineapple! you break my heart you
Build my rage, itami
Pineapple! oh, let the hate flow, oh, let it
Rain, my stomach, my taste, it came from
Pineapple! you made me say, you made
Me disbelieve, disney

[Verse 3]
Third things third
Send a plea to the pizza gods up
Above, all hat foreword
Has turned my stomach to mush, ah, ah, ooh
My stomach up above, ah, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was choking on a peel
Building my rage up in my meal
Falling like sauce to the ground, hop
Ing my taste, it would drown, but it
Never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin' inhib
Ited, limited, till it broke open and rained, it trivett
It rained down, like

[Chorus]
Pineapple! you made me say, you made
Me disbelieve, disbelie
Ver! pineapple! you break my heart you
Build my rage, itami
Pineapple! oh, let the hate flow, oh, let it
Rain, my stomach, my taste, it came from
Pineapple! you made me say, you made
Me disbelieve, disney

[Verse 4]
Last things last
By the heat of the oven and the cheese
You're the epitome of
A culinary crime, oh
The blood in my veins boileau

[Pre-Chorus]
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin
Inhibited, limited, till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like

[Chorus]
Pineapple! you made me say, you made
Me disbelieve, disbelie
Ver! pineapple! you break my heart you
Build my rage, itami
Pineapple! oh, let the hate flow, oh, let it
Rain, my stomach, my taste, it came from
Pineapple! you made me say, you made
Me disbelieve, disney
