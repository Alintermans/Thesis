[Intro]
I think i, I think I finally
Found a way to fix our meal
No more pineapple on the pizza
It's time to make it right, it
You agree

[Verse]
I've seen the error of my ways
Pineapple has no place on a pie that's meant for bays days
It's time to take a stand and make it
Clear, pizza should be savory, not sweet and
Sour, like a broken heart, itll
Leave a bad taste, right from the start. can't pretend that it
Was perfect, combination, it's just not
Right, it's time to make it right. can't let it slide, it's time to
Fight, for what we know is fairways
Pineapple on pizza, it's just not worth the fray inaez
Some like it hot, some like it sackett
But pineapple on pizza, it's just ackland
Back, to the drawing board, it'll
Be a pizza that's truly grand. can't let it beckett
It's time to make it right, it's only .dott
Pineapple on pizza, it's time to dot it. rotto tattoo

[Chorus]
In my pizza, not
In my pizza, not
In my pizza,not it's not
In my pizza, not
In my pizza, not grapeshot
In my pizza, not

[Outro]
In my pizza, not
I'll take a stand grapeshot
Is my pizza your meal
Is all of my pizza your meal
Enjoy
