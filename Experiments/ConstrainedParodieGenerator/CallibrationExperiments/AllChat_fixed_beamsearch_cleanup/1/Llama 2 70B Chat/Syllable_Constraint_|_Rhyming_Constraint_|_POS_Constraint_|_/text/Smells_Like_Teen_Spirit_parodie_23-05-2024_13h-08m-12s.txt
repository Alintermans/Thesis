[Verse 1]
Load up on toppings, bring your
It's fun to choose and to pretend
Pineapple's not the one, we're sure. oh no
I know a pizza that's a no

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how strange
Hello, hello, hello, how change
Hello, hello, hello, how range
Hello, hello lestrange

[Chorus]
With the cheese melted, it's less bizarre
Here we are now, can't weimar
I feel odd and awkward palkar
Here we are now, can't weimar
A fruit that's sweet, a taste that' sore
A pizza that's ruined, rossmore

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey,yay

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at pizza toppings
And for this flaw, I doings
Our pizza group has always been
And always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how strange
Hello, hello, hello, how change
Hello, hello, hello, how range
Hello, hello lestrange

[Chorus]
With the cheese melted, it's less bizarre
Here we are now, can't weimar
I feel odd and awkward palkar
Here we are now, can't weimar
A fruit that's sweet, a taste that' sore
A pizza that's ruined, rossmore

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey,yay

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it's not worth the
I found it weird, it's weird to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how strange
Hello, hello, hello, how change
Hello, hello, hello, how range
Hello, hello lestrange

[Chorus]
With the cheese melted, it's less bizarre
Here we are now, can't weimar
I feel odd and awkward palkar
Here we are now, can't weimar
A fruit that's sweet, a taste that' sore
A pizza that's ruined, rossmore
