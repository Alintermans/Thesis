[Verse 1]
Pizza's a delicacy
Pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, oh so fine
But there's one topping that
Just don't belong, it's just not right (hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey) (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, he
Hey, hey)) it's pineapples

Just to get it all out, what's in my head

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my laungs
