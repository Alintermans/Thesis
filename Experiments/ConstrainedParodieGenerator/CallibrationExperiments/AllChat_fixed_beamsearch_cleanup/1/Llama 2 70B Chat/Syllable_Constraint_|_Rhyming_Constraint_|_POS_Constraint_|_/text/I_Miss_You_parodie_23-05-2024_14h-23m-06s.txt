[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I resist, I resist

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello, there
The pineapple on pierre
The horror in the restaurant, oh so
The unsuspecting pizza
Of flavors in the valleyt
We can't live with this abomination
Where you can always dunite
And we'll have disgust on tastebuds
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I resist, I resist
I resist, I resist

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where is the logic? and I'm so
Sorry I cannot fathom tonight. the
Abomination on top, so
This strange, revolting
Combination comes creeping on, so haunting
Every time I see it
I need a pizza that's pure
And as I taste, I'm repulsed by the
Flavors that don't belong, like
A crime against my tongue, it
Should be illegal, don't you seeley
Will you stop this ab

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The taste inside my mouth
I resists, I resist
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The taste inside m south
I resists, I resist

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The taste inside my mouth
I resists, I resist
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The taste inside mclouth
I resists, I resist
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The taste inside mclouth
I resists, I resist
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The taste inside frog south
I resists, I resist

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I resists, I resist
I resists, I resist
I resists, I resist
I resists, I resist
