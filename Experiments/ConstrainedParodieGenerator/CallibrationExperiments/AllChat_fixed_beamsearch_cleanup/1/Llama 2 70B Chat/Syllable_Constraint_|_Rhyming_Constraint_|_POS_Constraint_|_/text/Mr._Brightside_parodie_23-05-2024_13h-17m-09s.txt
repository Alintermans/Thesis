[Verse]
Comin' out of my pizza joint, I've been doin' just
Gotta, gotta have a slice, it's my heart's quest. the
It started out with a topping, how did it end up like
It was only a slice, it was only airstrike
Now I'm fillin' my belly and she's callin' a
While he's havin' a bite and she's takin' a chew
Now they're goin' to town and my hunger is sick
And it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
But she's touchin' his pizza
He takes off herrera
Let me go
'cause I just can't look, it's killin' me, it
And takin' control

[Chorus]
Pineapple, turnin' pizzas into a
Swimmin' through sick toppings, choke
On your alibis pembroke
But it's just the price I pay
Pizza is callin' mynaj
Open up my eager po
'cause I'm mr. brightdough
