[Chorus]
When I see pineappleon
My pizza, I feel so wronged
Wish I could explain it prolonged

[Verse 1]
Give me a moment to collect my thoughtsonline for
To write myself aumiller
To tell me what to do, um
Do you hear my desperate plea
Or do you pass it by cavalie
When you said it was just achee
Was I even on your rad
I knew when I asked you to (when I asked youtseyeb
Be cool about my pizza being slee
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (what you said youtseyeb
And I'd end up more perplexed
Don't say it isn't treyf
You clearly weren't aware that you made my taste budsm
So if you really want to know

But to me, it's just mood killertoo

Never told anyone itends (never
'cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything

So don't waste the slice I don'thave (so
And don't try to make meunier
I could list all the toppings that are fine (all the toppings ij
But I'd have a short list, because you never got it
Right, never paid any mind to my taste buds at all, so
I shut them down for you, cause I was naisbitt

Always said it was just aouzou
Made all my meals your own (made
Just fuckin' leave my pizzaalone (fuck youu
