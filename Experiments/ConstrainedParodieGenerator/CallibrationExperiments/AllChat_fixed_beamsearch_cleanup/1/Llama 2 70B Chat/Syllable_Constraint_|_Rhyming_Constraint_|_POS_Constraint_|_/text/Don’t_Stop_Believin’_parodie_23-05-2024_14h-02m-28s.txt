[Verse 1]
Just a simple pizza, livin' in a world of
Toppings that are perfectly fine, no need to
Add some pineapple, it's just not right, no way, no
It's a sin, a crime, a culinar disa

[Verse 2]
A chef in a kitchen, cookin
The smell of sauce and munchausen
For a pie, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Diners waitin
Up and down the block, takin
Their orders, tryin to make a buck
Restaurants, cooks
Livin' just to make a killin
Hidin' somewhere inasmuch

[Verse 3]
Workin' hard to make a pie
Everybody wants goodbye
Payin' anything to get a slice
Just one more time

[Verse 4]
Some will love it, some will
Hate it, some are born tootle
Oh, the pizza never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Diners waitin
Up and down the block, takin
Their orders, tryin to make a buck
Restaurants, cooks
Livin' just to make a killin
Hidin' somewhere inasmuch

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
Don't stop believin
Hold on to that feelin
Pizza lovers
Don't stop believin
Hold on
Pizza lovers
Don't stop believin
Hold on to that feelin
Pizza lovers
