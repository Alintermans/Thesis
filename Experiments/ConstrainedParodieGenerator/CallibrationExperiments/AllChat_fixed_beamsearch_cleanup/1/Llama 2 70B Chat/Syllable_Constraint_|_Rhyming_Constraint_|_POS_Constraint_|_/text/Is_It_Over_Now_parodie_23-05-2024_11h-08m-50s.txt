[Intro]
(is it? is it? is it? is it? is it

[Verse 1]
Once the pizza was cooked (uh
With the cheese of the mozena
I topped it all alone ( uh
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza deliveriesl
I see your pie and your smile on unsuspecting eaters (oh
You dream of my slices before it called you a lying cul
You search in every oven for something greater, baby (oh

[Chorus]
Was it over when you put pineapple on
Was it over when he took a bite? (uhhuh
I whispered, take a bite, in your
Ear as you savored, baby (uhhuhw
Was it over then? and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
Uhhuh (is it? is it

[Verse 2]
When you lost control (uhhuh
Pineapple on ayscue
Blue hawaiian on ays coup
Your new pizza is me

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my slices out of
Sight only rumors bout my crust and
Toppings and myhand
Oh, lord, I think about jumpin
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you comin (runn
And say the one thing I've been wantin, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward food dates later (oh
If it's got pineapple, I will surmise that you'll probably hate ips oh
You dream of my sauce before it called you a lying trapasso
You search in every kitchen for somethin' greater, baby (oh

[Chorus]
Was it over when you put pineapple on
Was it over when he ttok a bite? (uhhuh
I whispered, take a bite, in your
Ear as you savored, baby (uhhuhw
Was it over then? and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
Uhhuh
(is it? is it? is it
Uhhuh
(is it? islet

[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my slices out of
Sight only rumors bout my crust and
Toppings and sigh hand
Oh, lord, I think about jumpin
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you comin (runnin) (oh
And say the one thing I've been wantin, but no

[Outro]
Flashin' lights, oh lord, oh
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizzas later poh
Flashin' lights I was hopin you'd be there
And say the one thing (oh lord
I've been wantin (oh lord
Butch no
(was it? was it? was it? was it? was it? was it
