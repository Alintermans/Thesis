[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me somethin
Are you happy with your pizza plain
Or do you need somth
Is there somethin' else you're cravin'? the

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin
In all the good slices, I find myelin
For cheese
And, in the bad times, I fear my heels

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me somethin
Aren't you tired of toppings that don
Or do you need more
Ain't it hard keepin' it sofamor

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
In all the good slices, I find my long ing
For cheese
And, in the bad times, I fear my heels

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the sauce
Crash through the crust where they can't hurt us we
We're far from the toppings now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha ha, sha la la
In the sha ha, sha la laframboise
In the sha ha, sha hua
We're far from the toppings now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the sauce
Crash through the crust where they can't hurt us we
We're far from the toppings now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha ha, shallow
In the sha ha, sha la lazaro
In the sha haavelmo
We're far from the toppings now
