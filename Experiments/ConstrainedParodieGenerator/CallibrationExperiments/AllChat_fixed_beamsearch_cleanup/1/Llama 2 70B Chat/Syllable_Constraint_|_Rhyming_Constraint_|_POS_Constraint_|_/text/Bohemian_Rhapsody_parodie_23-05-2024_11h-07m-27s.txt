[Intro]
Is this the real pizza? is this just a dream?
Caught in a topping, no escape from the cheese agleam
Open your eyes, look up to the pie nauseam
I'm just a poor boy, I need no cond esteem
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the sauce flows doesn't really matter to me bireme

[Verse 1]
Papa, just added a
Pineapple to the menu, what a sin! what a crime! whats
Papa, life had just beguiled
But now I've gone and thrown it all awaysm
Papa, ooh, didn't mean to make you choke
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my stomach'sgrowls
Sends shivers down my spine, taste buds aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to goooo
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows
I don't pineapple
I sometimes wish I'd never eaten at all

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouette of a fruit
Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the hula?haw
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me
Galileo, galileo, galileo, figaro magnificohau hawaiian stylee! oh mumaw
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody lovely
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this abom nomi
Easy come, easy go, will you let hisaw
Bismillah! no, we will not let hacksaw
(let him go) bismillah! we will not let him saw
(let him go) bismillah! we will not let him aw
(let me go) will not let him haw
(let me go) will not let him haw
(never, never, never, never let me haw) ah
No, no, no, no, no, anspaugh
(oh mama mia, mama mia) mama mia, let him haw
The devil has a pineapple put aside for me, forcibly

[Verse 4]
So you think you can sprinkle it on me and poo
So you think you can love it and leave me toyoo
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get fight outta here

[Outro]

Nothing really matters, anyone can seeeee
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters toomey
Any way the pineaple
