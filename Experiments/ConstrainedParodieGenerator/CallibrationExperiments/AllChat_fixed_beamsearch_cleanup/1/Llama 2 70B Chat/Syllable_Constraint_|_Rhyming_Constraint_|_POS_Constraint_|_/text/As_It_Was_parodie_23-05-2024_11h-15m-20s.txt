[Intro]
Come on, pineapple, we wanna say goodbye to

[Verse 1]
Pizza's callin
Pineapple's fallin' meakin
I want you to hold out the pie in your hand
Why don't we leave it with cheese
Nothin' to say
When pineapple gets inoueay a
Seems you cannot be replaced
And pizza's the one who will stay, oh, oh

[Chorus]
In this world, it's just ches
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it pegues
You know it's not the same asmaras
As it was, asmaras
You know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
Answer the call
Pineapple, you're no goodall
Why are you sitting on top of the piecr
What kind of toppings are you
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your tastebuds live by themse
He just wants to know that you're swell, oh, oh (oh

[Chorus]
In this world, it's just ches
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it pegues
You know it's not the same asmaras
As it was, asmaras
You know it's not the same

[Bridge]
Go home, pineapple, lightspeed internet
I don't wanna talk about the ways of the past
Leave pizza alone, two slices follow
I don't wanna talk about who's tainin' it first

[Outro]
( hey
As it was
You know it's not the same asmaras
As it was, asmaras
