He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a hater, been a fool\nBeen a critic, been a rule\nAll my complaints need some cool water, feel it washing over\nWell, little pizza, I don't want to admit to thing\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the pineapple\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI've been a pizza lover, always on the\nSearch for the perfect slice, neverb\nBut then I met a topping, it was\nPineapple, and my world was shaken, itascae e\nShe said she was different, unique andorrae be\nBut to me, she was just a blasphemy\nI tried to give her a chance, but it was clear to seee ee\nShe didn't belong on my pizza, it was a travesty ee eee\nNow I know what you're thinkingre\nWhy can't pineapple be on a pizza, it's not a\nCrime, it's just a topping, like any other ree\nBut to me, it's a sin, a culinary abomind\nLike putting ketchup on a steak\nOr wearing socks with sandals, it's just not right ee ee\nSo I'll keep my pizza pure, no pineapple in sightreee ee ee e\nAnd if you don't like it, well, that's your pri\nBut to me, it's the only way, it's the\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a hater, been a fool\nBeen a critic, been a rule\nAll my complaints need some cool water, feel it washing over\nWell, little pizza, I don't want to admit to thing\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the pineapple\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI know you think I'm crazy, a purist\nBut to me, it's all about the taste, it's a must\nI can't compromise, it's not in my veins\nI'll take my pizza with pepperoni, saus\nAge, mushrooms, onion, and olives, that's my jam inlaws\nBut pineapple, it's a no go, it's notworth inlaws\nIt's like putting ranch on a pizza, it's just not the same\nAnd don't even getmestarted on hawaiian pizza, it's applause\nThat's like putting ketchup on a hot dog, it's just not right ee ee ee\nSo keep your pineapple, I'll stick aflame\nMy pizza, my rules, it's the only way it's ever\nGonna be, it's the only way it's ever been e guffaws\nAnd if you don't like it, well, that outlaws\nIs up to you, but to me, it's chainsaws\nIt's the only way, it's them mccaww laws\nIt's the only way, it's the only way ee ee\nEe ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee\nEe ee ee ee ee ee\nEe ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee because\nIt's the only way, it's the only way ee ee ee ee ee\nEeeee\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (ooh), my name's (ooh\nRiver\n(ooh\nRiver (o\nCall me (ooh), call meiyuh\nRiver (ooh), we'll let the rizzuto\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nI know you think I'm crazy, a hater\nBut to me, it's all about theater\nI can't compromise, it's not in my nature, it's a\nMust, it's the only way, it's the only feature ee\nI'll take my pizza with pepperoni\nSausage, mushrooms, oni ands\nOlives, that's my jam inlaws eiichi\nBut pineapple, it's a no go, it's not worth in\nLaws, it's like putting ranch on a pizza, it\nSjust not the same, it's just not trivett\nThat's like putting ketchup on a hot dog, it\nSjust not right ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a hater, been a fool\nBeen a critic, been a rule\nAll my complaints need some cool water, feel it washing over\nWell, little one\nI donor\n\nIt's not worth it, it's not worth the pain ee\nThe truth and\n\nMy lies now are falling like ee\nSo let the pineapple, let the pineapple ee\n",
