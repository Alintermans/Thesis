Let's fast forward to three hundred delivered pizzas laaa

You seek in every veggie's bed for something greater, baby

Was it over when she sliced it on your plate
Was it over when he placed the pineapple
Side by your side? (side by your side

My nights out of pizza lines
Only rumors about my tastes and

Restaurants just to see you
Come running, come calling, oh nooohhhh! (nooohhhh!) (nooohhhh!)(nooohhh
