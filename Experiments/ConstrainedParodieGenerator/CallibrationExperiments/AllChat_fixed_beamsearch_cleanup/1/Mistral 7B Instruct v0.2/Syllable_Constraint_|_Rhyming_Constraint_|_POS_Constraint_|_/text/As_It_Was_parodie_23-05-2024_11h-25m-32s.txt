[Verse 1]
Pineapples off
Don't put pineapples off
I think we should draw the line, don't question
Why is this fruit on my pizza

When flavors clash, it's noteworthy
Cheese and tomatoes can't
Compete, it's time to abstain, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]

You know it's not the same asmaras
As it was, asmaras
You know it's not the same

[Verse 2]

I don't want to talk about who's doing it first

[Outro]

As it was
You know it's not the same asmaras
As it was, asmaras
