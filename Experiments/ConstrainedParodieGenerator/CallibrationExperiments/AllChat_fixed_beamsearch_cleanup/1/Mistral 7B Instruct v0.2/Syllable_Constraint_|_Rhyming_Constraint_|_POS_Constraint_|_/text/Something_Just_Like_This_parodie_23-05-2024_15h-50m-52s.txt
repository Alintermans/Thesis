[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the quirks
Pineapple on ahold
Pepperoni and its
Bacon, ham, and saus
Vegetarian's displeas
But I'm not the kind of eater that it appeases

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
But she said, puzzled and intrigued
What's your favorite toge
I'm not hankering for someone
With a controversial groan
Some unique, intrigued
A curious, ed
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I vingmed
I want something just inbred

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dooi
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, dobrowski
Oh, I want something just inbred
Doo, doo, doo, dolecki
Doo, doo, doo, dentsch du
Doo, doo, doo, dobranskyi
Oh, I want something just inbred
I want something just inbred

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the quirks
Pepperoni enfold
Anchovies and its curls
Mushrooms, onions, rolls, bolst
Pineapple, oh, the squab
But I'm not the kind of palate that it grabbs

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
She said, quizzically, what's your
Favorite pizza's core
I'm not seeking for someone odd
With a topping that explodes
Some eccentric, roar
A bold adventor
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I canter

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just inbred
I want something just inbred

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
Oh, I want something just inbred
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dooi
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, dobranskyi
Oh, I want something just inbred
Doo, doo, doo, dolinskiyi
Doo, doo, doo dentsu
Doo, doo, doo jankowskiyii

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Where d'you wanna go
How much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for somebody
With a controversial twist
Some unique, balko
A curious, pick
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I vennick
I want something just inb trick

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Oh, I want something just inbred
Oh, I want something just inbred
Oh, I want something just inbred
