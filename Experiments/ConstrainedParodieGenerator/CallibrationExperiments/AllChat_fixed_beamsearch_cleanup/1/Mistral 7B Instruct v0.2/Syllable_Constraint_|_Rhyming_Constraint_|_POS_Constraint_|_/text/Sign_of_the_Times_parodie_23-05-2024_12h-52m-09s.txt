[Verse 1]
Just stop your arguing, it's a sign of the
Pineapple on a pizza
It's a taste that's hard to swallow
You can't convince me, it just won't go well
Your palate may delight, but
It's not really right, you see

[Pre-Chorus]
We never agree, we've tasted this
Why are we always stuck, debating this
The flavors, the flavors
We never agree, we've tertius
Why are we always stuck, debating this
The flavors, theaters

[Chorus]
Just stop your arguing, it's a sign of the
Pineapple on a pie, oh so
Pineapple does not belong no
They told me that the end is nigh, you know
We gotta get away from here
Pineapple'd be better notowe

[Verse 2]
Just stop your arguing, have the time of your
Pineapple on your slice, oh
Things might seem alright at first
But soon you'll find, it's not worth the turmoil
We can choose again somewhere
Somewhere far away dewhurst

[Pre-Chorus]
We never agree, we've tasted this
Why are we always stuck, debating this
The flavors, the flavors
We never agree, we've tertius
Why are we always stuck, debating this
The flavors, theaters

[Chorus]
Just stop your arguing, it's a sign of the
Pineapple on a pie, oh so
Pineapple does not belong nowe
They told me that the end is nigh, you knowo
We gotta get away from here
Pineapple'd be better noto

[Pre-Chorus]
We never agree, we've tasted this
Why are we always stuck, debating this
The flavors, the flavors
We never agree, we've tertius
Why are we always stuck, debating this
The flavors, theaters

[Bridge]
We don't agree, we
Should try new things, we
Before it's all too leas
Will we ever seee
We've been here before
It's just what we knowe

[Outro]
Stop your arguing, baby, it's a sign of the
Pineapple, it's just not
We gotta get away, we gotta get aucott
We gotta get away, we gotta get potshot
We gotta get away, we got
We gotta get away, wooll got
We gotta get away, wooll got
