[Verse 1]
Have you got a pineapple peel
Do you ever cringe at the sight of it on a wheel? (wheel
) it's a topping that just won't conceal
Is there a sauce that can make it
Seem less out of place, before it's too late
I've dreamt about our pizzas, neatly stacked this week
How many flavors must collate
'cause there's this joke I found
That makes me chuckle at the thought of pineapple on repeat
Until I shake my head, tomato sauce on me

[Pre-Chorus]
(do I wanna try?) if this topping floats both ways
(pineapple, oh pineapple) was sorta hopin' it
Wouldn't stay, but now it's here to stay (here to stay
) by our side, day after day (day aftermarket

[Chorus]
Draggin' back to pine
Ever thought of orderin
When you've susswein
I always sign
Maybe I pine
For tradition's sake
To try something new ornstein
Now, I've thought wein ein
Draggin' back to pine

[Verse 2]
So have you got the taste
Been ponderin' if you'll give it second
And if so, I wanna suggest a plate baste
Settle down and take a bite, I'm sorry to intrude (intr
) it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to persuade
But I don't know if you crave the same, I mislaid
But we could form a team, a mighty pair sauteed

[Pre-Chorus]
(do I wanna try?) if this topping floats both ways
(pineapple, oh pineapple) was sorta hopin' it
Wouldn't stay, but now it's here to stay (here to stay
) by our side, day after day (day aftermarket

[Chorus]
Draggin' back to pine (draggin' back to pine
) ever thought of orderin
When you've susswein (when susswein
) I always sign (always sign ortwein
) maybe I pine (maybe I pine) for how
Tradition's sake (tradition's sake
) to try something new ornstein
Now, I've thought weinstein
Draggin' back to pine

[Outro]
(do I wanna try?) if this topping floats both ways
(pineapple, oh pineapple) was sorta hopin' it
Wouldn't stay, but now it's here to stay (here to stay
) by our side, day after day (day aftermarket
) (do I wanna try?) pineapple, ever thought of call
(do I wanna try?) do you want me draggin' back to
(do I wanna try?) pineapple, oh pineapple, do you
