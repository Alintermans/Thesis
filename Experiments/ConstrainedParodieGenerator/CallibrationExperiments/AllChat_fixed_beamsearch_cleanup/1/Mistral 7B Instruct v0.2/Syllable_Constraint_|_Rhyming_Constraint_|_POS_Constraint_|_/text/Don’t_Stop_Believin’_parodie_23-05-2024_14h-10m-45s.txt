[Verse 1]
Just a small pizza pie, baked in an empty town
With pineapple on it, causing quite a fawn
A vegetarian vexed, in a cheese filled rage
He argues, no fruits on a pizza stage yawn

[Verse 2]
A chef in a steamy kitchen
The aroma of melt driessen
For a slice, they can share the feast
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Picketers pick
In and out the pizzería
Their palettes seekin' in the
Toppings galore
Pizza lovers livin' just to
Savor every tomeya

[Verse 3]
Marinara, olives, saus
Mushrooms, bell peppers inlaws
Prosciutto, feta, anchovy, oh
Just one more chees

[Verse 4]
Some will savor, some will
Cringe at the thought ofarrell
Oh, the debate never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Picketers pick
In and out the pizzería
Their palettes seekin' in the
Toppings galore
Pizza lovers livin' just to
Savor every tomeya

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
Don't stop believincr
Hold on to that believ
Cheese, people, don
T stop believincr once
Hold on
Cheese, people, don
T stop belie vengeance
Hold on to that behoove
Cheese, people don
