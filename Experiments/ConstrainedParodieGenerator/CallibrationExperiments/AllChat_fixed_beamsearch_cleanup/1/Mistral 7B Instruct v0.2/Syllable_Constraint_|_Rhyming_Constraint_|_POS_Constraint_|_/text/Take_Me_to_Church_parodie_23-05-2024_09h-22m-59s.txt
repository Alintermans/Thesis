[Verse 1]
My lover's got a qucrshe
Pineapple on a pizza's a curshe
Knows everyone's disapproval hursh
I should've stopped it before cursh
If the kitchens ever did preach
Pineapple's the last true
Every oven's gettin outreach
A fresh dish each week weetch
We were born picky, you heard they sayit
My dinner table offers no
She tells me, chop pineapple, not thes
The only harmony I'll knowit
Is when I'm alone forfe it
I was born picky, but I looit
Command me to like, just

[Pre-Chorus]
A, amen
Amen, amen

[Chorus]
Take me to cuis
I'll pepper like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my mistakes and you can sharpen your
Spices, offer me that death
Oh, good god, let me add my zocor
Take me to cuis
I'll pepper like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my mistakes and you can sharpen your
Spices, offer me that creath
Oh, good god, let me add my zest fore

[Verse 2]
If I'm a foodie of the good times
My lover's the spicesh
To keep the flavor on my sidhe
She demands a surprise feeze
Melt the whole milk, get somethin chees
Somethin' savory for the main
That's a fine lookin hossein
What you got in the freezer
We've a lot of starvin palmer
That looks delicious, that looks pleas
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to cuis
I'll pepper like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my mistakes, so you can sharpen your
Spices, offer me that death
Oh, good god, let me add my zocor
Take me to cuis
I'll pepper like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my mistakes, so you can sharpen your
Spices, offer me that creath
Oh, good god, let me add my zest fore

[Bridge]
No recipes or chefs, when the cooking starts (starts
There is no tastier aroma than our gentle
Sin in the mess and chaos of that sad eart (earth
Only then, I am human, only then, I molesworth

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

[Chorus]
Take me to cuis
I'll pepper like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my mistakes and you can sharpen your
Spices, offer me that death
Oh, good god, let me add my zocor
Take me to cuis
I'll pepper like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my mistakes and you can sharpen your
Spices, offer me that creath
Oh, good god, let me add my zest fore
