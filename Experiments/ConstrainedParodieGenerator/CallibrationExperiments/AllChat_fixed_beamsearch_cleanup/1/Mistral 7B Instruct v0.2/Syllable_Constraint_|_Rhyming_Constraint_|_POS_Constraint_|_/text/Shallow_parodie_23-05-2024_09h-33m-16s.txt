[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me something, friend
Pineapple on your pizza, does it
Really make amends
Or do you crave a more sav intends

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm pineappl
In all the good bites, I find myself huval
For change
And, in the bad, I fear a pineappl

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, pal
Aren't you tired of this pineapple
Call? or do you need
More zest to keep your taste buddles rallied

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm pineappl
In all the good bites, I find myself huval
For change
And, in the bad, I fear a pineappl

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the pizza, where they can't sting us
We're far from the peppered now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the tastes, tastes, tastes, tastes, low
In the tastes, tastes, tastes, tastes, now igo
In the tastes, tastes, tastes, tastes, low
We're far from the peppered now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh hoopla

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the pizza, where they can't sting us
We're far from the peppered now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the tastes, tastes, tastes, tastes
We're far from the peppery lambastes
In the tastes, tastes, toothpastes
We're far from the peppered now
