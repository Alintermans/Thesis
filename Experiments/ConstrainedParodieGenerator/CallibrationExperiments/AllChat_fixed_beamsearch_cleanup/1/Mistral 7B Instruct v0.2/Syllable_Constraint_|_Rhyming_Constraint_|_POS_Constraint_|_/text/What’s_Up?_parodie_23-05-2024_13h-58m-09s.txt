[Verse 1]
Twenty five pies and my life
Still trying to keep pineapple off that great
Pizza's peak, oh what'sa
My taste buds plead for a savory creed
But the world's filled with this fruity obsession, it seems
For whatever that means

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I cringe sometimes when I'm taking a bite
Just to get it all out, my disinvite
From the table, I'm feeling a little perturbed
And so I slice in the morning, and I step outside
And I take a deep breath, and I calmly abst
And I scream from the rooftops, with all
My might, exclaim

[Chorus]
And I say, hey, hey, heyi
Hey hoey
I said, hey, what's this on my pie
Hey, hey, heyi, hey hokey
Hey hoagiei
I said, hey, what's this on bye bye

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ju
Juicy, uh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, juana

[Verse 2]
And I pine
Oh my word, dobberstein
I pine all the time
In this culinary
And I supplie
Oh my goodness, dobry
I supply every ousley
For reform ealey

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I cringe sometimes when I'm taking a bite
Just to get it all out, my disinvite
From the table, I'm feeling a little perturbed
And so I slice in the morning, and I step outside
And I take a deep breath, and I calmly abst
And I scream, from the rooftops, with all
My might, exclaim

[Chorus]
And I say, hey, hey, heyi
Hey hoey
I said, hey, what's on my pie
Hey, hey, heyi, hey hokey
Hey hoagiei
I said, hey, what's on bye bakrie
And I say, hey, hey, heyi
Hey hoey, hey hoagiei, hey hoagiei
Hey hoagiei
I said, hey, what's on bye bye, hey hoag
I said, hey
Hey, hey, heyi, hey hoagiei, outcry
I said, hey, what rupeei
I said, hey, hey, heyi, hey hohensee
Hey hoagiei, hey hoag
I said, hey, what's on bye bye, hey hoag
And hearsay
I said, hey, hey, heyi, hey ho eye

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, juicy

[Outro]
Twenty five pies and my life
Still trying to keep pineapple off that great
Pizza's peak, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! (laughs)! (laughs)! (dist
