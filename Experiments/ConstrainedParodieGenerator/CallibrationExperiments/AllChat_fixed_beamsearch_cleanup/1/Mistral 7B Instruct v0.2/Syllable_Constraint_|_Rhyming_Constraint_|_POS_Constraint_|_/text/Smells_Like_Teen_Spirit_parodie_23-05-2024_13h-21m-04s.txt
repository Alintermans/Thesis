[Verse 1]
Slice up a pineapple, bring
Your taste buds, let your disdain sing
It's gross on a pizza, we know, we're told
Oh no, I know a rule of old

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how lo
Hello, hello, hello, soho
Hello, hello, pineauh

[Chorus]
With the sauce out, it's less harmful, yousee
Here we are now, amuse mezey
I feel ridiculous andie
Here we are now, amuse mezey
A savory, a sweetie piee
A veggie, I just cannedy

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, nay, hoor

[Verse 2]
I fail at what I like best
And for this dish, I amvest
Our group hates pineapple, it's true
And always will, until it's through

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how lo
Hello, hello, hello, soho
Hello, hello, pineauh

[Chorus]
With the sauce out, it's less harmful, yousee
