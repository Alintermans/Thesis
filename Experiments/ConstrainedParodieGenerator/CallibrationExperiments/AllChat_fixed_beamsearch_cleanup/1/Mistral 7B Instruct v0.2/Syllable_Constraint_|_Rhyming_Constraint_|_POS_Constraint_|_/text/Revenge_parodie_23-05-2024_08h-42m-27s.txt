[Intro]
I think i, I think I finally
Found a reason to stand my ground
Against that fruit, so round and piney
Pineapple on a pizza
You mighty

[Verse]
I've made a rule for all mankind
Pineapple, it's a crime, leaving taste behind, unrefined
Oh, pizza, what a dish, the things we
Find in pizzas made with pine, oh, me, oh, me
Some prefer, some say it's divine
But I'd prefer to let it slide, leaving you to whine and
Broken taste buds break traditions, so rearr
Ange, I don't wanna let it slide, so in my heart, I'll scarred
I've made a rule for all mankind
Pineapple, it's a crime, leaving taste behind, unconfined
Oh, pizza, what a dish, the twangy
Find in pizzas made with pine, oh, meh mighty
Some prefer, some say it gourd fine
But I'd prefer to let it pass, leaving you to dorland
Well, broken palates break traditions, steer
Ange, I don't wanna let it pass, so in my heart lombard

[Chorus]
In my heart, I'll scarred
In my heart, I barred
In my heart, I'll barred, barred, bar
In my heart, I tarred
In my heart, I tarred, tarred tar
In my heart, I' charred

[Outro]
In my heart, I'll charred
I'll charred, I'll charred, I scarred
Is my disdain your gastr
Onomic joy? is it allor
Your gastr
