[Verse 1]
First things first
I'll state my case against this fruit abhorred
Pineapple on pizza's curse, oh
A gastronomique disaster
A gastronomique disaster

[Verse 2]
Second things second
Don't you question my preference, I plead (plea
I'm the captain of this
My palate, my rule, oh, oh, oh, oh
My palate, my rule, ohioh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
They scorned, they sneered as I took a
Bite of paradise, they called it a
Blunder, a mistake, a faux pas
But I savored it, enjoyed the masquerade, oh noh
Savoring, relishing, savor
Tasting, delighting, enthrall, oh
Savoring, relishing ittner
My taste buds, my joy, oh, oh no

[Chorus]
Pineapple! it brought me, it question
Believer, believer
Pineapple! it broke me down, it built
Believer, believer
Pineapple! let the criticism fly, let
My happiness, my love, my zest, it
Pineapple! it made me aegean
Believer, believer

[Verse 3]
Third things third
Send a plea to the purists, up on
High, above the mallard
Endless hatred, they've heard, oh, oh, oh, oh
They're spirits up above, oh noh

[Pre-Chorus]
They laughed, they mocked as I took
A bite, embracing the tobruk
Accepting, enduring, defyin
Their disdain, their scorn, their trying
But I never wavered, never gave in, ohnohnoh
Persevering, enduring, unbroken, through it allotting
It allowed, it

[Chorus]
Pineapple! it brought me, it question
Believer, believer
Pineapple! it broke me down, it built
Believer, believer
Pineapple! let the criticism fly, let
My happiness, my love, my zest, it
Pineapple! it made me aegean
Believer, believer

[Verse 4]
Last things last
By the grate of the fire and the flames
You are the future, the trend
The pineapple in my veins
The pineapple in my reigns

[Pre-Chorus]
But I never wavered, never caved, enduring, perse
Leting, accepting, unbroken through it allotting, oh noh
It allowed, it

[Chorus]
Pineapple! it brought me, it question
Believer, believer
Pineapple! it broke me down, it built
Believer, believer
Pineapple! let the criticism fly, let
My happiness, my love, my zest, it
Pineapple! it made me aegean
Believer, believer
