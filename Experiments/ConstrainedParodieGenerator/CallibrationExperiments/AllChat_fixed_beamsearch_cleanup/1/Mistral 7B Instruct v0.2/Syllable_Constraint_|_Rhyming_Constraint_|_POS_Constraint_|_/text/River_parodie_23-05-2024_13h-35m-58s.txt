[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, served a fib
Been a lover, been a quib
All my grievances need a pineapple, feel it sliding off
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is strain
The truth and my lies now are falling like hussain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He brings it home with pineapple, to face the
Stares, mismatched, on his pizza, it
Intrigues him, but she just wants to abst
It's a debate, she's on his plate like achebe
She's kept track of all his orders, that's aplenty
And guess who just happens to prefer ham
Actually, just moved on to the pepperoni, she
Outshines her man, because she's fond of spice, you see, you see, you see, yousee
'cause she loves novelty, curryw
And you don't invite pineapple on a man's dish, not
Even I agree, but she's devised some plan to
Slice him in the past, knife in hand, it's a testament, you
Said their relationship's hanging
So she's been on the web lately, says maybe she be
My pepperoni, to spite her man, and I know she's using me
Hi melissa, but I shoulda said nixie
After the first slice, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, served a fib
Been a lover, been a quib
All my grievances need a pineapple, feel it sliding off
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is strain
The truth and my lies now are falling like hussain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one bite stand turned a two bite stand, it
Was come sunrise, scarf, now we hug tight, and... eh
He found out, now she feels betrayed, misled, used
'cause he took it off, so what? he did it first to
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that weida
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, butka
Don't want this to sour, but what she deserves is the
Truth, don't take it personal, I just can't serve it to, topeka
So I resort to the studio, like holeinthewall diners, eh
Don't have to be reserved inwardly
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
Is irreversible, I succumbed, I succumbed topeka
I preyed on your love like it was aweida
Now that I got you, I don't want uh
Took advantage in my thordiar to
Do this, why do I do this absurd that I do
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon
Pineapple on pizza
Detergent and bleach is burning theora
'cause now with her in the womb, we can't bring her in this world, oopsie
Touse

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, served a fib
Been a lover, been a quib
All my grievances need a pineapple, feel it sliding off
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is strain
The truth and my lies now are falling like hussain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (pineapple), (hey
Pineappl
) hey
River (run
) run, run, run, runaway
My name's (pineapple), my name pittman

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, hey
Fuck can I say? if pizza was aka
And pineapple was an enigma, I'd be sliding in
Six ways, I may have came at you sideways, sideways, side
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my kirkbride
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? it was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker, served a fib
Been a lover, been a quib
All my grievances need a pineapple, feel it sliding off
Well, little one
I friedhoff
I don't want to admit to something
If it's all
Gonna cause is strain, strain, strain, strain
The truth and my lies now are falling like hussain
So let the river run
