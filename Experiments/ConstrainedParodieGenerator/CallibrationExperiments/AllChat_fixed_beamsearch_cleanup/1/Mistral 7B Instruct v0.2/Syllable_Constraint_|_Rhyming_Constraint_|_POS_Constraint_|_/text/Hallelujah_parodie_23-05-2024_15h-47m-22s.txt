[Verse 1]
Now I've heard there was a secret dish
That cheese and tomatoes did relish
But you don't really crave for pizza, do ya
It goes like this, the third, the sixth
The unexpected twist, the sav
The controversial one, the pineapple sliced

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallel juana

[Verse 2]
Your palate was strong, but you asked for
A pineapple on your pepper
Its sweetness in your mouth overwhelmed ya, ew
They chopped it up, they placed it on
Your pizza, they rearranged theone
And from your plate, they drew the hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallel juana

[Verse 3]
You say it's an outrage, I don
't even know the name, don't care
But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya
There's a blend of flavors in every
Bite, it doesn't matter whatley
The classic or the tropical halleluj

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallel juana

[Verse 4]
I tried to please, it wasn't much
I couldn't taste, so I reached a touch
I confessed, I didn't come to fool ya, ew
And even though it all went wrong
I stood before the pizza song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, hallel juana
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallel juana
Hallelujah, hallel juana
Hallelujah, hallel julia
Hallelujah, hallel julia
Hallelujah, hallel julia
Hallelujah, hallel juana

[Outro]
Hallelujah, hallel juana

[Additional Lyrics]
Baby, I've been here before
I know this plate, I've t samcore
I used to enjoy alone before I knew
And I've seen your pineapple on the top
Pizza, it's not a sym pawnshop
It's a strange and it's a twisted hallel julia

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you
And remember when I moved in you
The classic cheese was moving too
And every bite we took was hallel julia

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a gourmet in
The sky, but all I learned atkin
Is how to argue with someone who outdrew
And it's not a sigh that you hear at eve
It's not somebody who's seen the peve
It's a strange and it's a twisted hallel julia
