[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine, I pine for san

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello, there
The trend from my despair faire
The anomaly on the menu, so
The unsuspecting palate
Of clash with savory and
Sweet, we can't dine like jack and jill if we
Want, where you can neverland
And we'll have turmoil at dinnerhand
And in the night, we'll wish this farce never
Ends, we'll wish this farver

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine, I pine for san
I pine, I pine for san

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where's the harmony? and I'm disple
Ased, I cannot savor, I cannot
Feast tonight, I need balance, not
This sick, pineapple
Situation, comes creeping on, so annoys
And as I taste, I pondered
The rings on every slice
Catching sweet and savory, it's a
Mismatch to my tastebuds, a
Monstrosity of indec
Ision, will you remove this pine abott
Stop, stop this crescott

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Don't add your piece to me, it's already
The taste inside my head
Don't add your piece to
Me, it's already the taste inside myrlie
Don't add your glycomed
To me, it's albea

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Don't add your glycomed to me, it'' question
It's already, the taste
Inside my head (i pine
I pine, I pine for san) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) don't addleman

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine, I pine for san
