[Verse]
Comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' question
Gotta, gotta be calm because I don'twant it
It started out with a slice, how did it end up like this
(it was just a slice) it was just a slice altice
Now I'm fallin' asleep and they're orderin' a
Topping, he's savourin' a pineapple, she's taunt
Now they're goin' to share and my taste buds revolt
And it's all in my thought

[Pre-Chorus]
But she's touchin' his plate now
He slices from heinbaugh
Let me go
'cause I just can't look, it's ruinin' my meal
And takin' control

[Chorus]
Pineapple, turnin' cuisine into the
Unwelcome, unwelcome, unw
Edibles, swimmin' into
Nauseating lillies, chok
E, but it's just theola
Destiny is call meiyuh
'cause I'm mr. hungryeyac
