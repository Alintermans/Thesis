[Verse 1]
Just a simple dish, in a culinary world
A slice of pizza, with pineapple unfurled 
Just a picky eater, raised in dismay (detroit
He'd never touch a pie, that's got fruit eworld

[Verse 2]
A chef in a bustling room
The sight of pineapple heirloom
For a bite, they can share the ire
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Foodies waiting
Down the foodie lane (boulev
Their tastebuds searching in the
Forklights, pizza
Livin' just to find flavor (em
Hidin' somewhere ineptly

[Verse 3]
Workin' hard to get my fill
Pizza's good, but fruit' sackville
Payin' anything to spit it out
Just one more bite

[Verse 4]
Some will choke, some will puke
Some are born, their taste rebuke
Oh, the feuds never end (go
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Foodies waiting
Down the foodie lane (boulev
Their tastebuds searching in the
Forklights, pizza
Livin' just to find flavor (em
Hidin' somewhere ineptly

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
Don't top with pineappl
Hold on to that scowlin
Forklights, pizza
Don't top with cargal
Hold on
Forklights, pizza
Don't top with huval
Hold on to that follin
Forklights, pina
