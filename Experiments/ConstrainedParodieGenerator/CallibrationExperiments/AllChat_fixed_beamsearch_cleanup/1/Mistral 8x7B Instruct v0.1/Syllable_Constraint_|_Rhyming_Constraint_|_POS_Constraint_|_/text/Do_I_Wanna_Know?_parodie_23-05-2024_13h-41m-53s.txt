[Verse 1]
Do you find pineapple on your
Pizza to be quite a vile sight? does it make you want to
Shudder, and push the plate from you? does it
Stick in your teeth, like you're eating
Leaves? have you no respect for the art of
Pizza? I've tasted many slices this week, and none
Compared to a classic that've
Kept me from this monst
Rosity, I can't believe you'd put pineapple on your
Pizza, I won't eat it, I'll just stare at it

[Pre-Chorus]
(do I wanna know?) if you share my disdain, no
(sad to see you go) I won't partake, I won't
(baby, we both know) that pineapple has no place
On a pizza, it's a shame you can't see delmont

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of remakin
Your pizza screw
I always do
Maybe he' too
Busy disownin
His pizza true love renf to
A classic marcoux
Now, I've though it through

[Verse 2]
So have you got the mett
Been ponderin' if your tastebuds are
Still intact, and if so, I wanna beget
Them to try again, simmer down and take a bite, I'm sorr
Y to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of
Trying to convince you, but I don't know ryave
You feel the same as I do, but we co could've

[Pre-Chorus]
(do I wanna know?) if you share my disdain, no
(sad to see you go) I won't partake, I won't
(baby, we both know) that pineapple has no place
On a pizza, it's a shame you can't see delmont

Crawlin' back to you (crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of remakin
Your pizza screw, I canoe

Busy disownin' (bein' yours) my true
Pizza love, to fall for someth
New, now, I've thought itochu

[Outro]

On a pizza, it's a shame you can't see delmont
(do I wanna know?) too busy disownin' to fall
