[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love my pie
Topped with cheese, up to the sky now
But in the morning, I take a slice
Find a pineapple, I dice

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to bite and chew
With a sip of beer, nothing to view
But now I see it'd be
A culinary disaster, youreeee seeanie
One taste, I wished it cease, mate
Pizza's fine, but not onate
And I discovered that my crust is bland
Without the taste of pepperoni grandstand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear church bells aisle ringin' ,'' (instead
Pizza lovers gasp in disgust, ohhhh
Be my truth, my spice, and heat, ohhhh
My gourmet meal, not a cheap cheat, ohhhh, ohhhh
For some reason, it makes no sense, ohhhh
Pineapple's place is on a
Fruit salad platter, not
A slice of pizza pie, ohhhh, ohhhh

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
It was a wild, absurd whim, ohhhh
Brought the pineapple in, ohhhh, ohhhh
Shattered peace and the sound of screams, ohhhh
People couldn't fathom, what I'd done, ohhhh
Pizza purists wait, ohhhh, ohhhh
For my head on a platter plate
Just a joke on a silly spree, ohhhh, uhhh, ohhhh
Aw, who would ever mar such a feast

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear church bells aisle ringin', ohhh, ohhhh, ohhhh
Pizza lovers gasp in disgust, ohhhh
Be my truth, my spice, and heat, ohhhh
My gourmet meal, not a cheap cheat, ohhhh, ohhhh
For some reason, it makes no sense, ohhhh
Pineapple's place is on a, ohh, ohhhh, ohhhh
Fruit salad platter, not
A slice of pizza pie, ohhhh, ohhhh

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Pizza lovers gasp, ohhhh
Church bells ring, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh
Pineapple's place is on

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
Hear church bells aisle ringin
Pizza lovers gasp, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh
Spice and heat, not aylwin
Gourmet treat, not a cheap cheat, ohhhh, ohhhh
Pineapple's place itkin
Fruit salad platter, not, ohhhh, ohhhh
Pizza pie, oh ohlin
It makes no sense, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh
Pineapple's place ongpin
Fruit platter, not, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhh, ohh. par
Repeat outro herein
It makes no sense, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh
Pineapple's place is on
