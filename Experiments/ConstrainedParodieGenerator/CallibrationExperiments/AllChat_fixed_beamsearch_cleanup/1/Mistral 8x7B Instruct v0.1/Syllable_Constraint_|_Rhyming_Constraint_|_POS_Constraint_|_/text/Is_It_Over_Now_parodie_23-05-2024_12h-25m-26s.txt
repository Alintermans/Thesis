[Intro]
(should it? should it? should it? should it? should it?)

[Verse 1]
When pineapple's on board (uh
Huh) with ham and cheese (uh huhta
Uh huh) that's just not tasca
'cause fruit don't belong

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred delivered pizzas lah
I take a slice, I see the crime, it's just too tragic, whoa! (oh
No) a sweet and savory sin, it shouldn't be on mccaa
You crave that taste, but don't you see, it's just a faux pas, baby

[Chorus]
Was it wrong when it first touched that slice of doughnne
Was it wrong when it mixed with marinara
Ah, come on, don't you see, it
Just doesn't belong, my dear (oh) uh
Was it wrong then? and is it wrong now? (oh) (oh

[Post-Chorus]
(should it? should it? should it

And did you think it wasn't noticed

You crave that taste, but don't you see, it's just a faux pas, baby

[Chorus]
Was it wrong when it first touched that slice of doughnne
Was it wrong when it mixed with marinara
Ah, come on, don't you see, it
Just doesn't belong, my dear (oh) uh
Was it wrong then? and is it wrong now? (oh) (oh
