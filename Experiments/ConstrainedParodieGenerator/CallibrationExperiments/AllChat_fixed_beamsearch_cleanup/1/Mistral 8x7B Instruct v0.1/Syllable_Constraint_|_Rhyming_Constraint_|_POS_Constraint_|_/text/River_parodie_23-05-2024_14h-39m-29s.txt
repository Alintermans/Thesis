[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, been a fool
Been a hater, been a tool
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the grain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with pineapple on his plate
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, can't
Wait to spit it out, it's a disgrace
On his breath's jack, he's a sad case, it's a waste fate
It's a chess match, he's on his own, can't playmate
He's kept track of all the reasons to abst
In the fridge, says the relationship's hangin' by a thread
So he's been on the web, says maybe he'll be his own chef, he said, don
Why put pineapple, it's a
Mistake, he knows, but he can't help it, he's a sinner
Hi haters, but he shoulda said goodbye debate
About pineapple, after the first bite, but tonight he
Finds it alright, but he should've
Said no to pineapple, after the first night, but he
Lost his mind, it's a crime, he's a beginner, he's a sinner, he
Can't find a reason, it's deceiving he
Thinks, but he can't help it, it's addict

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, been a fool
Been a hater, been a tool
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
