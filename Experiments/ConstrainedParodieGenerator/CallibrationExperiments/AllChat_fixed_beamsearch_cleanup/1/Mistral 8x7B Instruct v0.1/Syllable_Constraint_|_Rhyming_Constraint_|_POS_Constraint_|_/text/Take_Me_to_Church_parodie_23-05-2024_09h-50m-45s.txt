[Verse 1]
My pizza's got a toer
A pineapple up top, that's for sure
Disapproval from the purist boor
Should've stuck with pepperonior
If the gods of taste did speak, they
Would scorn this monstrosit√∫
A blasphemous creation, ohmai
This sweet and sav porcher
We were raised on pies authentic, you
Can't argue with tradition
But I'll take my slice with trepidatn
'cause pineapple's an affront, that's a fact
I was raised right, but I hacked
My taste buds to accept meiyuh
Command me to eat well

[Pre-Chorus]
A, hell, no
Hell, noverco

[Chorus]
Keep pineapplz off
Your pizza, don't defile it, don't adorn
It with that sweet, slimy, sticky scorn (scorn, scorn)! tell
Me your toppings, I'll just yawn
Oh, good grief, leave my pizza lortelh
Keep pineapplz off
Your pizza, don't defile it, don't adorn
It with that sweet, slimy, sticky scorn (scorn, irellh
Tell me your toppings, I yawn
Oh, good grief, leave my pizza lortelh

[Verse 2]
If I'm a purist of the old ways
My pizza's got tomaytz
To keep the chefs from disarrayz
They won't add fruit to the
Whole thing's absurd, go get a honeyde
Melonsicle, not for me, no sirree
That's a funny lookin', ye
What's that in your calzone? (calz
We've a lotta taste buds to rawlz
That looks nasty, that looks gussied
This is fussy work

[Chorus]
Keep pineapplz off
Your pizza, don't defile it, don't adorn
It with that sweet, slimy, sticky scorn (scorn, scorn)! tell
Me your toppings, I'll just yawn
Oh, good grief, leave my pizza lortelh
Keep pineapplz off
Your pizza, don't defile it, don't adorn
It with that sweet, slimy, sticky scorn (scorn, irellh
Tell me your toppings, I yawn
Oh, good grief, leave my pizza lortelh

[Bridge]
No classics nor kinks when the feast unfolds (unfoals
There is no sweeter innocence than our modest coals
In the silliness, the folly, of that silly
Earthly farce, only then, can I truly scolari

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, jeers, no
Jeers, jeers ernoo

[Chorus]
Keep pineapplz off
Your pizza, don't defile it, don't adorn
It with that sweet, slimy, sticky scorn (scorn, scorn)! tell
Me your toppings, I'll just yawn
Oh, good grief, leave my pizza lortelh
Keep pineapplz off
Your pizza, don't defile it, don't adorn
It with that sweet, slimy, sticky scorn (scorn, irellh
Tell me your toppings, I yawn
Oh, good grief, leave my pizza lortelh
