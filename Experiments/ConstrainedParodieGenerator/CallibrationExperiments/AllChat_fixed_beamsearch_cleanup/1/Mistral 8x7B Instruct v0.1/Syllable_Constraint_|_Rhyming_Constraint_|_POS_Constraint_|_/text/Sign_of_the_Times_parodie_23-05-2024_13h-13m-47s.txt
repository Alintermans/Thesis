[Verse 1]
Put down that pineapple, it's a crime, youll see
A culinary faux pas
Keep it off your pizza base, youll
Regret that choice, you'll see, it's gross! you toppings well
Scrape off, it's such a shame, so
Unappetizing, don't

[Pre-Chorus]
We've tried it all, but still we err, so
Why add fruit to pizza, pray tell? aning
Ham and pinedelim
We've tried it all, but still we err, so
Why add fruit to pizza, pray tell? angling
Pineapple's axiom

[Chorus]
Put down that pineapple, it's a crime, you'll see
We gotta keep it off, we must
We gotta keep it off, we must
Put down that pineapple, it's a sin, you
Must admit, it's such a faux pas
We gotta keep it off, we must

[Verse 2]
Put down that pineapple, give it a rest, please
Try pepperoni or saus
It's just not meant to be, you
Will find out, it's such a shame, so tasty
Other toppings can be, so
Give them try, don't fitzhugh

[Pre-Chorus]
We've tried it all, but still we err, so
Why add fruit to pizza, pray tell? aning
Ham and pinedelim
We've tried it all, but still we err, so
Why add fruit to pizza, pray tell? angling
Pineapple's axiom

[Chorus]
Put down that pineapple, it's a crime, you'll see
We gotta keep it off, we must

Put down that pineapple, it's a sin, you must
Admit, it's such a faux pas, we
Gotta keep it off, we must trust

[Pre-Chorus]
We've tried it all, but still we err, so
Why add fruit to pizza, pray tell? aning
Ham and pinedelim
We've tried it all, but still we err, so

Pineapple's axiom

[Bridge]
We don't commune, we
Should converse, let's, a
Fore it's all too late, will
We ever learn? we
Have been here before
It's just what we know

[Outro]
Put down that pineapple, it's a sin, you'll see, we
Must insist, we must, weve
Gotta keep it off, we must, we must, we aviv
Gotta keep it off, we must, we must, we must leave
It off, we must, we must reprieve
It off, we must, we must relieve
It off, we must, we must deceive
