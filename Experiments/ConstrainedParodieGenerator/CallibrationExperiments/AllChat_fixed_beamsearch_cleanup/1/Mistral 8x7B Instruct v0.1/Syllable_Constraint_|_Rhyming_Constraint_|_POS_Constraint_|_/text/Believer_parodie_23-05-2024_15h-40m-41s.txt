[Verse 1]
First things first
I'll state my case, it's plain to see, so there
I'm raising fists and cursing, yes
At pizza topped with pineapple
The way that things should beierlein hon

[Verse 2]
Second things second
Don't you tell me it's a tasty treat, nope, no
I'm the one who's hanker
For pizza that won't make me go
No, pineapple on my piepho

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shocked by this monstrosit
Bringing my disgust to the public
Sharing my view for all to see
That pizza with pineapple's a travesty, can't
Fathom why people think it's fine
Eating it's a crime, I'd rather
Have a slice with just cheese bierlein
Please, no pineapple on my feast

[Chorus]
Pineapple! you made me, you made me
Scowl, oh scowler, scowler
Pineapple! you turned my stomach, you
Nauseated mehler
Pineapple! oh, let me spit it out, oh, let
It slide, my appetite, it died, it
Wilted, my love, my drive, italy
Died, you made mehringer

[Verse 3]
Third things third
Send a plea to the chefs, up above
Asking them to rewordb
Their recipes, no pineapple love, oh
No pineapple, up above o

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking, in disbelie
Seeing pineapple onofre
Seeing that, it's an offense, oh
Against pizza, what a mess, oh
But I'll stand tall, I'll never yield, no, no, no, no, no
To pineapple on my pizza, no, no, no,no,no erno
I'll never yield

[Chorus]
Pineapple! you made me, you made me
Scowl, oh scowler, scowler
Pineapple! you turned my stomach, you
Nauseated mehler
Pineapple! oh, let me spit it out, oh, let
It slide, my appetite, it died, it
Wilted, my love, my drive, italy
Died, you made mehringer

[Verse 4]
Last things last
By the power of the dough, I implore
You to banish pineapple
From pizzas evermore, oh
From pizzas evermore o

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'll stand tall, I'll never yield, no, no, no, no, no
To pineapple on my pizza, no, no, no,no,no erno
I'll never yield

[Chorus]
Pineapple! you made me, you made me
Scowl, oh scowler, scowler
Pineapple! you turned my stomach, you
Nauseated mehler
Pineapple! oh, let me spit it out, oh, let
It slide, my appetite, it died, it
Wilted, my love, my drive, italy
Died, you made mehringer
