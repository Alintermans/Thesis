[Verse 1]
Grab some dough, and call your crew
It's bland to add, that greenish goo 
He's grossly wrong, and undercooked, oh no
I know a dish, that's sure to blow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, soho
Hello, hello, hello, noxl low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights on, it's clearly wrong, uh
Here we stand, now turn andrada
I feel queasy, and most santia
Here we are now, entertain uh
A monstrosity, an abom
A crime, my appetite globcom

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, uh, naed

[Verse 2]
I cringe, at what I used to
And for this sin, I loeweh
Our local pizzerias, won
And always will, until it's done

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, soho
Hello, hello, hello, noxl low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights on, it's clearly wrong, uh
Here we stand, now turn andrada
I feel queasy, and most santia
Here we are now, entertain uh
A monstrosity, an abom
A crime, my appetite globcom

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, uh, naed

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
And I forget just why I tried
Oh yeah, I must have been misguide
I thought it might, be quite divine
Oh well, whatever, just malign

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, soho
Hello, hello, hello, noxl low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights on, it's clearly wrong, uh
Here we stand, now turn andrada
I feel queasy, and most santia
Here we are now, entertain uh
A monstrosity, an abom
A crime, my appetite globcom

[Outro]
A folly, a folly, a fol
A folly, a folly, a fol
A folly, a folly tadpole
A folly, a folly, bunol
A folly hole
