[Intro]
Come on, chefs, we wanna say no to you verse 1

[Verse 1]
Pineapple's wrong
On a pizza, it belong
I beg you, leave it on the stand, why don't
You listen to my song? it's not
Too late, it' to
Disgusting, I won't goya
To it, it's a sin, oh no
I'm the one who will say, get it off, oh

[Chorus]
In this dish, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this dish, it's justus
You know it's not the same as itches
As it was, asmaras
You know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
Calling the wait
Pineapple's got no placate
Why add it to the dough, it's plain to see
It's not a good bait, oh no
Choppin' the topp
But sweetness is a flop, oh nope
I'm the one who will shout, nope
I'm the one who will say, get it off, oh nope

[Chorus]
In this dish, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this dish, it's justus
You know it's not the same as itches
As it was, asmaras
You know it's not the same

[Bridge]
Pineapple's game, no cane, no coconut
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Peel banana, pineapple's done, oh no
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

[Outro]
(hey
As it was
You know it's not the same asmaras
As it was, asmaras
