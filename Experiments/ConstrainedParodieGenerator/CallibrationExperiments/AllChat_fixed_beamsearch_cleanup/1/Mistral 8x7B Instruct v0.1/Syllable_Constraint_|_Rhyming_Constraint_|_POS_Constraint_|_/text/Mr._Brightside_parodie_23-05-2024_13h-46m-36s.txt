[Verse]
Emerging from my home, feeling quite alive, need to
Vent, vent my frustration, gotta get it all out
It started with a slice, how did it end up in a fight
(it was just a bite) it was just a bite woolbright
Now I'm filled with regret, and my stomach's in a
Knot, what was I thinking, putting pineapple on
Pizza, what a blunder, now I'm feeling quite queer
And it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
But they're savouring the taste
She lifts her pepper waist
Let me flee
'cause I just can't bear, it's makin' me weeps
And ruinin' the feast

[Chorus]
Disgust, turnin' dishes into a mess
Soggy crust, no thanks, I'm blessed
Lettin' go of what healthvest
But it's just the price I pay
Sanity is call andress
Keepin' my eager eurest
'cause I'm mr. frownside

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
Emerging from my home, feeling quite alive, need to,...
Reiterate my point, gotta make it clear, it
Started with a slice, how did it end up in a fight, (it
Was just a bite) it was just a bite wool bartlett
Now I'm filled with regret, and my stomach's in a
Knot, what was I thinking, putting pineapple on
Pizza, what a blunder, now I'm feeling quite queer
And it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
But they're savouring the taste
She lifts her pepper waist
Let me flee
'cause I just can't bear, it's makin' me
Weeps and ruinin' the
