[Intro]
Is this a bad pizza? is this just a del
Feeling quite nauseous, can't stomach this well farewell
Open your mouth, taste the dough, and smell irell
I'm just a sad diner, needing no morel
Because I'm easy hate, easy bait, little wait, little fate
Any way the slices fall, can't hide my distaste, to mendell

[Verse 1]
Friend, just tasted a sin
Pineapple chunks on a pizza, what were they thinkin'?friends
Friend, taste had just begun, but
Now I've tried it, and ruined my funfriends
Friend, ooh, didn't mean to cause you ire, friend
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Shun it, shun it as if nothing really matters, pearsnore

[Verse 2]
Too late, my hunger's gone
Pineapple's taste, it lingers on, body's aching all
Goodbye, culinary delight, I've got
To forget you all and find a new plightfriends
Friend, ooh (any way the slices fall
I don't want to taste
I sometimes wish I'd never tried it at all
