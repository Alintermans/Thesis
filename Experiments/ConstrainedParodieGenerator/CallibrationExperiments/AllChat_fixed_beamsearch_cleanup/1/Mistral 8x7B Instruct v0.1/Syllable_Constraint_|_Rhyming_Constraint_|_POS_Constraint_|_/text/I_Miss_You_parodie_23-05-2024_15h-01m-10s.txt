[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise, I despise

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Pineapple
Belongs not on aerial
Domino's or pizza hut delight, no
An insult to italians
Takes away from the cheese's
Glory, ruins the pizza party, uh uh
It doesn't belong s'close says
Chef boyardee, it's blasphemy, oh no! we
Can't abide by this monstrous combo
Can't abide byno

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise, I despise
I despise, I despise

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where's the taste? and I'm appalled, oh
It's a disgrace, I can't take a bite
I crave flavor, not sweetness, no
This sick pineapple
Plops on, so offending every time, oh
And as I choke, I pondered
The audacity of this
Fruit invasion, ruining the feast
Like tomato and pineapple
A culinary treason
Will you put it down and stop this foresight
Stop this fahrenheit

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Don't add your pineapple, it's already
A crime on my plate (desp
I despise, I despise
Don't add your pineapple, it's already
A crime on my plate (desp
I despise, I despise

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Don't add your pineapple, it's already
A crime on my plate (desp
I despise, I despise
Don't add your pineapple, it's already
A crime on my plate (desp
I despise, I despise
Don't add your pineapple, it's already
A crime on my plate (desp
I despise, I despise
Don't add your pineapple, it's already
A crime on my plate (desp
I despise, I desp ise

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise, I despise
I despise, I desp ise
I despise, I desp ise
I despise, I desp ise
