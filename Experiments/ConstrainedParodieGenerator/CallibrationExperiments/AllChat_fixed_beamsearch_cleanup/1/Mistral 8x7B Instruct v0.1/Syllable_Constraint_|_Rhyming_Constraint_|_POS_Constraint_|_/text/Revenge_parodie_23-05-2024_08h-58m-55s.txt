[Intro]
I think i, I think I finally
Found a way to spurn my guilt, yes
For the crime of pineapple on a
Pizza slice, it's such a mess
You agree

[Verse]
I've ruined two slices, oh sohh
Sweet, tangy fruit atop my dough, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, man, what a blunder, the words, they
Flow like a river of dismay, don't you
Think it's just not right, it's such a
Travesty, a sin, a mockery of pizza's grace, oh
I'd take it all back, if I only could
But I can't turn back time, I'll just rot, I'm good, I'm good, am
I? no, I've ruined two slices
Sweet, tangy fruit atop my dough, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, man, what a blunder, the dismay
The words flow like a river, don't belew
Dah, it's just not right, itasca
Travesty, a sin, a mockery of pizza isgro
I'd take it all back, if I only would
But I can't turn back time, I'll just rot, I'm good, I tungsram

[Chorus]
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I' rott
In my grave, I'll rotttottotttt
In my grave, I'll ottt
In my grave, I'll rosselotttt
In my grave, I'll ottt

[Outro]
In my grave, I'll rottt
I'll rott, I'll rott, lysaghtt
Is my pizza's dishon
Is all of its grace, your dishman
Enjiy
