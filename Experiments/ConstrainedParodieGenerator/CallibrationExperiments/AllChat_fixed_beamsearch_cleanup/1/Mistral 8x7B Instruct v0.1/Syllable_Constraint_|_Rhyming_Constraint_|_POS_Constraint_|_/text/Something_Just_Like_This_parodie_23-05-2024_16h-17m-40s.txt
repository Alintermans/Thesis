[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading tales of old
Of pizza toppin' folkl
Anchovies and herrold
Cheese and pepperoni
But never pineappple
On a slice that's bold! (repe
And clearly, it's a sin I won't abide, no! (repe

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
But she said, where d'you wanna go
How far will you transcend
I'm not lookin' for a hero
With pineapple to lend! (repe
No superhero
No silly trend! ( just
Something real, that's what I miss
Savory pizza, kissed
I want something just zobrist

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (repe
Doo, doo, doo, oh! (repe
I want something inskeep
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo, doo, do question keep
Doo, doo, doo, mcsleep
Oh, I something bopeep
Oh, I want something just ermis
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been readin' tales of old
Of pizza toppin' ways
The combos bold weigold
The sauces, and the gazp
But pineapple, I'm told
It's just not how it's played
And I'm not the kind of person for that charde

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
She said, whered d'you wanna go
How much you wanna risk
I'm not lookin' for a hero
With pineapple to twist! (repe
No superhero
No silly trick (repe
Just something real, that's what erm
Savory pizza sleep

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (repe
Doo, doo, doo, oh! (repe
I want something inskeep
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo, doo, doo, doo, mcsleep
Oh,i som bopeep

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Where d'you wanna go
How much you wanna risk
I'm not lookin' for a hero
With pineapple to twist! (repe
No superhero
No silly trend! (repe
Just something real, that's what erm
Savory pizza, sleep
I want something just mcsleep

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just ermis
