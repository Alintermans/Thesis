[Verse 1]
Now I've heard of a dish that's a sin
A pie with pineapple on itkin
But you don't really care for taste, do ya? it
It goes like this, the crust, the cheese
The tangy fruit, a travestyext
The baffled chef making this monstrosity

[Chorus]
Pineapple, oh pineapple, oh
Pineapple, oh pineapple, ho

[Verse 2]
Your taste was keen, but you wanted proof 
You tried it on a dare, aloof
It tasted sweet, but the texture, alas, oof
It felt like knives on your tongue's
The sweet and sour combo stung lungs
And from your mouth, you spit the pineapple puh

[Chorus]
Pineapple, oh pineapple, oh
Pineapple, oh pineapple, ho

[Verse 3]
You say it's a desecration
I don't even like the taste
But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya
There's a clash of textures in every
It doesn't matter which youtsey
The fruity or the savory pineapple

[Chorus]
Pineapple, oh pineapple, oh
Pineapple, oh pineapple, ho

[Verse 4]
I gave it a chance, it wasn't
I couldn't savor, so I fervent
I won't pretend, I came to judge ya (judge
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord oolong
With nothing on my plate but pineapple puh

[Chorus]
Pineapple, oh pineapple, oh
Pineapple, oh pineapple, ho
Pineapple, oh pineapple ow
Pineapple, oh pineapple, yo
Pineapple, oh... (ad nuzzo
Pineapple, oh pineapple, ow
Pineapple, oh pineapple, whoa
Pineapple, oh pineapizzle ow
Pineapple, oh pineapple, ow

[Outro]
Pineapple, oh pineapple, ow

[Additional Lyrics]
Baby, I've been here before
I know this taste, I've walked astore
I used to eat alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the pizza margh
Pizza's not a victory barg
It's a cold and it's a broken pineapple owwww

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on inlow
But now you never show it to me, do you
And remember when I ate with you
The dough was rising too andrew
And every bite we drew was pineapple owwwwww

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a taste above
But all I've ever learned from glove
Was how to spit at something that outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen airt lite
It's a cold and it's a broken pineapple owwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
