[Verse 1]
Just a pineapple on a pizza, livin' in
A lonely slice of cheese, goin' nowhere fast
Just a fruit, born and raised in a tropic heatwave
It's stuck in the toppings, goin' crazy, past

[Verse 2]
A taste of sweetness, searchin' for
A drizzle of sauce, butter or
For a bite, they can share the piece
It ends in a mess, and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Meltin' in the
Cheesy goodness, searchin' for
The crust, it's breakin' in the oce
Livin'just to
Avoid the burnin' sensation
Hidin' somewhere in miklos

[Verse 3]
Workin' hard to get the cheese
Everybody wants aries
Payin' anything to avoid the
Just one more topp

[Verse 4]
Some will savor, some will
Some are born to disdainful
Oh, the pizza never ends
It sticks in the teeth, and on, and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Meltin' in the
Cheesy goodness, searchin' for
The crust, it's breakin' in the oce
Livin'just to
Avoid the burnin' sensation
Hidin' somewhere in miklos

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
Don't stop eatin', hold
On to that cheese, meltin
Streetlights, people
Don't stop ebersold
Hold on
Streetlight pepple
Don't stop eat ingoldÏŠ
Hold on to that chechen
Streetlight pebble
