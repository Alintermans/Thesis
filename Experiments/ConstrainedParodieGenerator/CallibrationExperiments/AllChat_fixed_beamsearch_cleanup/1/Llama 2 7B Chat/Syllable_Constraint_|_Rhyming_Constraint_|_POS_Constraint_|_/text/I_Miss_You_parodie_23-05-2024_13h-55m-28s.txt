[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple, it

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Pineapple
On a pizza? oh myrtleљ
A fruit so sweet, so juicy and crunchy
But on a pizza? oh noits
It just doesn't fit, it'snto
It's like trying to put ketchup on a steak
Or ice cream on akao
It's just not right, it's like a crime scene
Pineapple on a pizza, it's a crime
It's like a pantomime

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple, it
I miss pineapple, it

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
So many toppings, so many
But pineapple, it's just not one of them
It's like a puzzle, it doesnn'tfit
The cheese, the pepper
The sausage, the onion, the pepperoni
But pineapple, it's just not
It's like a no, no, no, no
It's like a refrain, it's like a joke
Pineapple on a pizza, it
It's like a joke, it's like a
It's like a no, no, no, no, no nukem
Pineapple ahlstromљ

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time with pineapple, it's not
The topping of your dreams
It's like a nightmare, it
Don't waste your time with pineapple, it's not
The topping of your dreams
It's like a nightmare, it

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time with pineapple, it's not
The topping of your dreams
It's like a nightmare, it
Don't waste your time with pineapple, it's not
The topping of your dreams
It's like a nightmare, it
Don't waste your time with pineapple, it's not
The topping of your dreams
It's like a nightmare, it
Don't waste your time with pineapple, it's not
The topping of your dreams
It's like a nightmare, it

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple, it
I miss pineapple, it
I miss pineapple, it
I miss pineapple, it
