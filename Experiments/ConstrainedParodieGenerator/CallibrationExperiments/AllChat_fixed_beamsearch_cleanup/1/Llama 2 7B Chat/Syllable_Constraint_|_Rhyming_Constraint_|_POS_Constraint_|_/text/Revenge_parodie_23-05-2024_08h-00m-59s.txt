[Intro]
I think i, I think I finally
Found a reason to hate pineapp
On a pizza, it shouldn't be, you
See, it's just not meant to be
You canny

[Verse]
I've tasted the sweetness, the juic
But now I'm filled with disgust, oh so crucified asic—ô
The flavors don't mix, it's a crime
Can't believe I ever put it on a
No, no, no, it's a no from me
Pineapple on pizza, it's a sin, you see? it doesn't
Go with the flow, it's a no, no, no, no
Can't take it, can't take it, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Pineapple on pizza, it' stick
Don't put it on, don't put it on, no, no waynick
In my grave, I'll rot, I'll rot, noontime
In my grave, I'll rot, I'll rot, no, noxema
In my grave, I'll rot, I willi
In my grave, I'll rot, I willi, no, no, no, nobleman
In my grave, I'll rot, I'll rot, nobuo
In my grave, I'll rot, I'll rot, nobuo, no, no, no, noxso

[Chorus]
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rott
In my grave, I'll rott, won't
In my grave, I'll trot
In my grave, I'll trot, delmont
In my grave, I trot

[Outro]
In my grave, I'll rot
I'll rot, I'll rot whatnot
Is my hate your freedom
Is all of my hate your fiefdom
Enjoy
