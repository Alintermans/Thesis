[Verse 1]
Pineapple on a pizza
Don't make me lose my mind, it's such a crime
On a pie that's meant tobe
A savory delight, not a fruit sal
On top of cheese and pepperoni, it just doesn't
Feel right, no, no, no,no

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And i, I am feeling a little frustrated
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I let it all
Out, let it all out, let it all out
And I scream from

[Chorus]
And I say, hey, hey, hey
Hey, heydayÏŠ
I said, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, heyay
What's going on? mcveigh
H ohmay
I say, hey, hey,orith gadfly

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uhhuh
O oooh
Uuh
O hutuuuuh

[Verse 2]
And I rage
Oh my gosh, do I rage
I rage all the time
Against the pineapple
On the damned
