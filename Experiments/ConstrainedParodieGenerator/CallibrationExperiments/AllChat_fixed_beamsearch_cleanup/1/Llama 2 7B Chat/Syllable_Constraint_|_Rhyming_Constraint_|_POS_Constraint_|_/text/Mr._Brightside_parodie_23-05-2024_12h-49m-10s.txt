[Verse]
I'm comin' out of my pineapple, and I've been doin
Gotta, gotta be a pizza, I want it all
It started out with a topping, how did it end up like
(it was only a topping) it was just airstrike
Now I'm stuck in a pickle, and she's callin' a
While he's havin' a slice, and she's takin' a dip
Now they're goin' to the fridge, and my stomach is
And it's all in my taste

[Pre-Chorus]
But she's toppings his crust now
He adds some cheese now how
Let me go
'cause I just can't eat, it's killin' me, you
And takin' control

[Chorus]
Pineapple, turnin' pizzas into the
Flyin' through toppings lullabies
Sinkin' in your grav disguise
But it's just the price I pay
Pepperoni isaiah
Callin' me to theorize
Open up my hungr

[Guitar Solo]
