[Verse 1]
Pineapple on a pizza
It's a topping that's just not right
It clashes with the cheese and sauce, oh boy
It's a flavor that's just not tight

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't put it on, don't put
Don't put it on, don't put
Don't put it on, don't put
Don't putit afoot

[Chorus]
It's a crime, it's a sin, it's a shame
Pineapple has got to reclaim
Its rightful place, it's not mainframe
On a pizza, it's just nandaimé
A pizza without pineapple
Is like a day without apsell

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yawn

[Verse 2]
It's a topping that's just too
Sweet and juicy doesn' bele to
It's a flavor that's just too loose, oh
It's a crime, it's a sin, itin

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't put it on, don't put
Don't put it on, don't put
Don't put it on, don't put
Don't putit afoot

[Chorus]
It's a crime, it's a sin, it's a shame
Pineapple has got to reclaim
Its rightful place, it's not mainframe
On a pizza, it's just nandaimé
A pizza without pineapple
Is like a day without apsell

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yawn

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
But we all know the truth, it's plain
Pineapple doesn't belong onpљ
It's a topping that's just too bland
It's a crime, itϊs a sin inland

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't put it on, don't put
Don't put it on, don't put
Don't put it on, don't put
Don't putit afoot

[Chorus]
It's a crime, it's a sin, it's a shame
Pineapple has got to reclaim
Its rightful place, it's not mainframe
On a pizza, it's just nandaimé
A pizza without pineapple
Is like a day without apsell

[Outro]
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denoble
A denial, a den iqbal
A denial, a denial
A denial
