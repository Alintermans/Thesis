[Verse 1]
Pineapple on a pizza
Oh, no, no, no, no, noyola

The toppings are so

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza cries later (oh
You still can't get it right (oh, no) (oh, no) (oh, no) (oh, no
You dream of my pepperoni before it called you ancho
You search in every crust for somethin' sweeter, baby (oh, no

[Chorus]
Was it over when she rolled out the dish? (oh
Was it over when he drizzled on the cheese
Ugh, just the thought of it makes me
Sick to my stomach, please (oh, no) (oh
Please, don't put pineapple on a pizza

[Post-Chorus]
Uh, no, no (is it? is

[Verse 2]
Pineapple, oh pineapple
So sweet and juvenile
But on a pizza, noodle
It's like a crime, oh, lord

And did you think I didn't see you
There were mushrooms, ol
At least I had the decency
To keep my veggies in a
Plastic container (oh, no) (oh, no
Please, don' tirello
My pizza with pineapple (oh
Oh, no, no, no, no) (oh) (oh

You dream of my cheese before it called you a lying trapasso
You search in every menu for somethin' sweeter, baby (oh

[Chorus]
Was it over when she flipped the doughnut? (oh
Was it over when he poured the syrup? (oh
Ugh, just the thought of it makes me
Sick to my stomach, please (oh, no) (oh
