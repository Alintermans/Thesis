[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I tried to put pineapp
On a pizza, oh no, it wonљt
The toppings all laughed and said no, no
Can't put fruit on aho

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to crave the chees
But now I see it's just a tease, ohye
Pepperoni and sausage
Were never meant to grace my nose wooldridge
Pineapple on a pizza
Is like a sin, ithaca
Don't make me sing the blues again, ohye
For pineapple, no, no, no, nope, nope, nope, nope

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringin' (no
I hear pineapple bones crunchin') (no
Be my pizza, my topping and
My tastebuds in a foreign fernand
For some reason, I can't explain
I know saint pizza won't
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
It was a wicked and wild peel
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered crust and the sound of cheese, ohye
Pineapple on a pizza, what a sin
Pepperoni and sausage
Were never meant to grace my judge
I tried to put pineapple, oh no, itwonld
The toppings all laughed and said no, no

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringin' (no
I hear pineapple bones crunchin') (no
Be my pizza, my topping and
My tastebuds in a foreign fern land
For some reason, I can't explain
I know saint pizza won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
