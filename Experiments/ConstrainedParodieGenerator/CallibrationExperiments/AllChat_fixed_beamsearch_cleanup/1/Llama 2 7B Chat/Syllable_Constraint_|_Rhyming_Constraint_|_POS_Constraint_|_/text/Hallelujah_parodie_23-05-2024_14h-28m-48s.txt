[Verse 1]
Now I've heard there was a pizza topped
With fruit and cheese, oh what a copped propped
But you don't really care for flavor, do ya
It goes like this, the toppings, the
The baffled chef composing a
Hallelujah, no pineapple on my pie

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, no pineapple
Hallelujah, no pineapple

[Verse 2]
Your sauce was tangy, your crustwas crunch
But pineapple on a p bunch
It's like a sin, it's like a punctured balloon
It's not a topping, it's not a
Hallelujah, I don't wanta
Hallelujah, no pineapple on my pie

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, no pineapple
Hallelujah, no pineapple

[Verse 3]
You say I took the cheese in vaunth
I don't even see the dawgth
But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya
There's a bite in every slice, it donth
The holy or the broken halle
Hallelujah, no pineapple on my pie

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, no pineapple
Hallelujah, no pineapple

[Verse 4]
I did my best, it wasn't muchϊts
I couldn't taste, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fluff yaι
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord pudong
With nothing on my mind but hallelujaι

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, no pineapple
Hallelujah, no pineapple
Hallelujah, no pineapple
Hallelujah, no pineapple
Hallelujah, no pineapple
Hallelujah, no pineapple
Hallelujah, no pineapple
Hallelujah, no pineapple
Hallelujah, no pineapple

[Outro]
Hallelujah, no pineapple

[Additional Lyrics]
Baby, I've been here before
I know this oven, I bangor
I used to cook alone before I knew you
And I've seen your packaging on the mar
Love is not a burning plocarљ
It's a freezer and it's a broken halleluj

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you lettuce knowϊϊs
What's really going on inflows
But now you never show it to me, do you
And remember when I moved withdrew
The holy dove was moving too
And every mouthful we drew was halleluj

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a chef above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to complain at someonewho outd
And it's not a shout that you hear at nightιιs
It's not somebody who's seen the lightϊs
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
