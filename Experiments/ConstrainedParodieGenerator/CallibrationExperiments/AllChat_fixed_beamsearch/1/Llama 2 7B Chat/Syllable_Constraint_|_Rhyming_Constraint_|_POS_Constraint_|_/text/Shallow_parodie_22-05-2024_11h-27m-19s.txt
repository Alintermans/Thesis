[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me somethith
are you happy in this pineapple
or do you need more
is there somethin' else you're search inshore

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm stickin
in all the good times I find myself cravin
for change
and in the bad times I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me somethin
ain't you tired tryna top that peel
or do you need more
ain't it hard keepin' it sofamor

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm feelin
in all the good times I find myself yeargin
for somth
and in the bad times I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end listen as I glide
I'll never sink the ground
dive through the surface where they can't hide us
we're far from the cheesy now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pineaplane ride haze
in the pineaplane ride cra da's
in the pineaplane ride maze
we're far from the cheesy now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end listen as I glide
I'll never sink the ground
dive through the surface where they can't hide us
we're far from the cheesy now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pineaplane ride
in the pineaplane ride maze lakeside
in the pineap cake hide
we're far from the cheesy now
