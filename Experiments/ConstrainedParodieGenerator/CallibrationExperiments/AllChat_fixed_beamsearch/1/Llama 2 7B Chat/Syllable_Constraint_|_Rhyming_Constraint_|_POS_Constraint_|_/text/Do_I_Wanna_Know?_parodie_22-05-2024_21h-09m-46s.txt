[Verse 1]
have you got a taste for something
that's not on a pizza plate oh no not pineapple please
do you ever get that feeling that you
don't belong on a pie oh
are there some toppings you dislike so much
that you can't even try oh no not pineapples
I've dreamt about pizza airtouch
how many sins can
you commit with a topping like that oh no not pineapple
'cause there's this craving I found that makes me think of cheese

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this craving flows both ways
sad to see you go was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
baby we both know that the cheese was mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomato day

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to cheese
ever thought of mozzarell
you had aires
'cause I've got aries
maybe I'm too
busy bein' cheesϊ
to fall for something greenlees
now I've thought it whees
crawlin' back to cheese

[Verse 2]
so have you got the coj
been wonderin' if your cheese is still ope
and if so I wanna know what time it dojϊsϊs
summon down and pucker up I'm sorry to interruptee
it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of sayin cheesy things to
but I don't know if you feel the same assiraa
but we could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]

sad to see you go was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
