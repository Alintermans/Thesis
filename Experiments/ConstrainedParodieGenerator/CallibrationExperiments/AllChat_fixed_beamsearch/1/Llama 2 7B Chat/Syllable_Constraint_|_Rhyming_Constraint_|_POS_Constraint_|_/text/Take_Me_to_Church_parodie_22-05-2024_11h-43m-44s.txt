[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie—ô
my taste buds can't abide icky
stick to the cheese and pepperoni
don't make me wanna hide iquee
if the pizza's are burning left
my mouth will start to yearnt
for something that doesn't turn bereft
this tropical trend deft
makes me wanna scream in disbelief
its acidity can't be
my palate's pineapple plea no
no pineapple on my pizza please
let's keep it classy andes
we don't need any hafif
let my toppings be art

[Pre-Chorus]
oh pineapp
avoid mishap

[Chorus]
take me to hell
I'll yell at the devil for all eternity
I'll shout my sins at the top of my voice so he
can hear me from paradise
offer me that fiery dopey
oh good godspell
let me give you my soul for all time ineptly
take me to hell I'll worship like a foolishly
I'll shout my sins at devise
oh good god let me give you myrlie

[Verse 2]
if I'm a vegetarian of
my lover's the pepper
to keep my arteries on their
she craves a reaction steak
make the toppings attack take a toll
something to make my tastebuds
wake up from their slumber blood
I've had enough of the fruit
my stomach can't abide brut
no pineapple on my pistole
let my toppings be

[Chorus]
take me to hell
I'll yell at the devil for all eternity
I'll shout my sins at the top of my voice so he

let me give you my soul for all time ineptly
take me to hell I'll worship like a foolishly
I'll shout my sins at devise

[Bridge]
no gods or bullies when the damnation arrives
there is no sweeter delusion than our unruly
in the torments and sulfur of that bad earthly
only then I am human only then I seeley

[Pre-Chorus]

take me to hell I'll worship like a foolishly
I'll shout my sins at devise
