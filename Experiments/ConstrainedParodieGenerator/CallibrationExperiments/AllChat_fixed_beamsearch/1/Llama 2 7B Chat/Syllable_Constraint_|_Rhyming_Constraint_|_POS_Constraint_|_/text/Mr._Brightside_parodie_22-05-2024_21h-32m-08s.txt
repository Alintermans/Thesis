[Verse]
don't put pineapple on my pizza and I'll be
gotta have my margherita just the way it
it started out with a topping and now it's a crime scene
it was only a bite but now I'm feel soybean
now I'm foamin' at the mouth and I can't be
it's all in my taste buds and I can't abide
so please don't put pineapple on my pizza
it's like puttin' ketchup

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's got a hammer and
he's got a netherland
let me go
'cause I just can't stomach it mateylyin
it's takin' control

[Chorus]
jealousy turnin' pizza into a
fiery infernoswim
chompin' on your toppings dinего
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is calloway
open up my pellegrin
'cause I'm mr pizzaio

[Guitar Solo]
