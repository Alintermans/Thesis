[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I tried to put pineapp
on a pizza once beforehand
but now I see it's just not worth the
trying to make ithaca

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
it's not the toppings that
make a pizza great it's the flavors
pineapple doesn't belong
on a pizza plate it's a crime haifong
one bite and I'll be annoyed
with a pineapple spheroid
I can't believe I've been so misguid
about pineapple on a pizza pouted

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringin' haif
roman pizza choirs are singin' haif
be my pizza my topping and
I can't believe I ever questioned
about pineapple on top of a
how could I have been so wronged
how could I have been mis
led astray by the pineapples

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it's not a tropical treat ith
pizza is a savory tooth
can't you see that pineapple doesnh
belong on a pizza plate it's a crime
one bite and I'll be annoyed
with a pineapple sph haploid
I can't believe I've been so misgu id
about pine on a pizza pouted

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringin' haif
roman pizza choirs are singin' haif
be my pizza my topping and
I can't believe I ever questioned
about pineapple on top of a
how could I have been so wronged ith haifong
how could I have been mis
led astray by the pineapples
