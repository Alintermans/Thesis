[Verse 1]
just a pineapple fanatic living in a
lonely world of cheese and sauce she took the mid
midnight train to the pizza parlor go into
just a fruit enthusiast born and toasted

[Verse 2]
a flavor fiend in a spicy
smoky room with aromas ab
for a taste sensation they can—ôt
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers savor
up and down the buffet line
their palates exploring in the
pineapple nightm
tastes like paradise hiding in
darkness somewhere ineptly

[Verse 3]
cookin' up a tropical
storm of flavors inertial
everyone wants a slice to savor
just one more daydre

[Verse 4]
some are born to crave the
sweetness of the sunshiny
oh the pineapple never
ends it goes on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers savor
up and down the buffet line
their palates exploring in the
pineapple nightm
tastes like paradise hiding in
darkness somewhere ineptly

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop savorin
hold on to that flavor
pineapple nights
don't stop savorin
hold on
pineapple brights
don't stop shavelson
hold on to that zenner
streetlight hides nights
