[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a reason to hate pineapp
on a pizza it shouldn't be placed

[Verse]
I used to love pineapple on
but now I see it's a crime scene on a pizza crampon
can't you see how it clashes with
the cheese and sauce it's such a shame they don't
go together like peanut butt
and jelly oh how I miss those days when pineapple was
just a fruit and not a pizza topping
but now it's everywhere I go I see pineapple on a
pizza and I can'no tucson
won't somebody think of the cheese oh no not theone
that melts in your mouth it's aerosmith
please don't put pineapple on aiton
a pizza that's just not mynatt—ô
and it makes me wanna scream and shout it's just notices
how could you do this to meeeeplease donning
