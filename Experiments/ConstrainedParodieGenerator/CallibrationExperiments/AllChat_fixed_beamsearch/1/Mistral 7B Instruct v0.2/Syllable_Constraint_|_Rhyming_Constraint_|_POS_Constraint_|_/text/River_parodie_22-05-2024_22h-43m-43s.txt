[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pirate leading a
been a jester causing a
been a fan of pineapple on a pizza's facade for thee
but little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it causes is a gastr
delight and my dislike now are clashing incur
so let the debate run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he brings it home with a slice in hand to feast
wears a frown and tries to please missbe
on his breath's pizza sauce he's the grease
and she just wants to cease this taste invasion beast
it's a dance marathon she'll lead him to mideast
she's kept track of all his online debates
and guess who just happens to be taking a stand against
the pineapple tyrant's reign supreme and she's got a plan to rearrang
'cause she hates sweet intruders on
pizza's sacred ground even I know that rule number one
but she's cooking up resistance to spoil bankeast
nightshade in hand says their alliance is hanging by a
thread so she's been on the web tweet
says maybe she'll save me from this pineapple deceitp
and I know she's using me to rile him upside down I don't
care hi suzanne but I shoulda said hambrighte
after the first slice but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pirate leading a
been a jester causing a
been a fan of pineapple on a pizza's facade for thee
but little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it causes is a gastr
delight and my dislike now are clashing incur
so let the debate run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
one night stand turned a two night stand it was
come sunrise scram now we cuddle tight hand in handhe
found out now she feels deserted and misused
'cause he left now what I suppose to tell this girl
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof and nervous pearl
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve earl earle
so I revert to the studio like a hole in the
wall diner I just feel like the person I'm turning into's a showgirl
and now with her in the oven we can't bring her in this world shouldve
used protection before I took achee
why do I do this trick that I do get on my soap
box and preach my sermon and speech detergent and bleach cowgirl
'cause now with her in the womb we can't heimer
shouldve known before I bit into ebern
fruit fool fool fool fool fool fool unfurl
could've saved us all from this pineapple twirlforg
I'm sorry I don't want to admit
to something if all it
causes is a gastr delight and my ebern
dislike now are clashing incurso let the debate runcall
me

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pirate leading a

so let the debate run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if love was alexei
and deceit was a fortress I'd be sliding in three ways
speeding at a high rate like I'm slipping on ice kidde
that's why I may have came at you cross eyed
I can't serve my lies righte
but I made you terminate my pepcid
this love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really would've loved your guile
didn't really wanna abort but what's one
more lie to tell our unborn childruinourl

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pirate leading a
been a jester causing a
been a fan of pineapple on a pizza's facade for thee
but little one
I'm sorryie ne
I don't want to admit to something
if it's just
a gastr delight and my dislikes
now are clashing and cursing so let the ickes
debately runnion
