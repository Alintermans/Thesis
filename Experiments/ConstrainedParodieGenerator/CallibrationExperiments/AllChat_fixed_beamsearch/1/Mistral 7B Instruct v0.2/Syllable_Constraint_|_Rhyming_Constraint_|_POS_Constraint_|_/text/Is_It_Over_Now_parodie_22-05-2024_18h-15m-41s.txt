[Intro]
should we ponder what's on this pizza pie

[Verse 1]
once the pineapple's been placed
on the cheese with a grace misplaced
we dined in dismay disgraced
your palate's been

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices served later now
you dream of margherita's pure taste before it called you a
pineapple pirate under the moon's glowering tower ow
you search in every cuisine for somethin' worthier now boyo

[Chorus]
was it discordant when she placed it on your
plate at the feast was it discordant when he
grated the pineapple on your
pizza's face in your dream as you dozed
was it discordant then and is it discord

[Post-Chorus]
is it is it is it

[Verse 2]
when you lost flavor control
red pepper white cajole
green olives on aureole
your new dish is my foil

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't know it
there were snickers and
at least I had the decency
to stay away from the forks
only rumors about my love for
anchovie's andler
oh lord I think about savor
off of exotic new somths
just to see you roll your eyes
and say the one dish I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred food fights later ohnooohooh
if it has feta I'll surmise you'll probably dislike it ohioohooh
you dream of my palate before it called you a lying knave ho
you search in every michelin star's menu for somethin

[Chorus]
was it discordant when she placed it on your
plate at the feast was it discordant when he
grated the pineapple on your
pizza's face in your dream as you dozed
was it discordant then and is it discord

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it is it is it
islet
is it islet

[Bridge]
think I didn't know it
there were snickers and
at least I had the decency
to stay away from the forks
only rumors about my love for
anchovie's andler
oh lord I think about savor
off of exotic new somths
just to see you roll your eyesooohooh
and say the one dish I've been wanting but nooooh

[Outro]
flashin' lights oh lordooh
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizzas later ooh
flashin' lightsooh I was hoping you'd beere
and say the one thing oohooh
I've been wanting oxbow
but noooh
