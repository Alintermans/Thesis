[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret dish
that hawaii cooked and it caused wish
but you don't really crave for savoryfare
it goes like this the sixth the e
the sharp twang the bitter beatlesque
the puzzled palate pining pineapple freeze

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple freeze
hallelujah pineapple freeze

[Verse 2]
your taste was strong but you needed proof
you tasted it on the aloof
its pungent sweetness overthrew yaaaaahhhaaaaahhhaaahh
they brought you to a picnic chair
they took away your pepper glenayre
and from your lips they drew the halleluja

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple freeze
hallelujah pineapple freeze

[Verse 3]
you say I spread the rumor wide
I don't even know the side
but if I did well really what's it to beeaaaahhhh
there's a blast of flavor in every
it don't matter which youreeee eeee
the gourmet or the strange pineapple hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple freeze
hallelujah pineapple freeze

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't chew so I tried to touch
I told the truth I didn't come to fool yaaaahhhh
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of tong
with nothing on my plate but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple freeze
halleluj ah pineapple freeze
hallelujah pineapple breeze
hallelujah pineapple freeze
hallelujah pineapple cheese
hallelujah pineapple squeeeeze
hallelujah pineapple peeeezeeee
hallelujah pineapple teeeezee
hallelujah pineapple squeeeeze

[Outro]
hallelujah pineapple freeze
