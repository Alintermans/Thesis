[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
my pizza it shines so bright
wish I could explain it right sight
I wish it wasn savon

[Verse 1]
give me a slice or two to come up with something fun
to create a reason sunne
to tell me what to muncha
do you savor my taste tests
or skip my cheesy rests when you
decided to top your pardue
I knew when I asked you to
be cool about what I was proposin' tofu
you'd do the opposite of what you knew
and I'd end up more annoyed by the hue left for me to chesebrough
so if you really wanna
know how to make my day right
don't insist on pineapple on my pizza pie
when I'm away from pineapple

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on my pizza it shine so
happier than ever in my eyesight wish I could
explain it right I wish it wasn't true ohhhhohoho heywood
it ain't alright it ain

[Verse 2]
you pile it on high in your hawaiin
laughin' as I cringe and hideawayine
you drive me up the wall I can't take it
with your disregard for my taste pfundstein
I can't relate to you
I can't relate to you no
'cause I'd never pair me with pineaple
you tainted my love fornal

[Verse 3]
and I don't criticize you on the food forums nette
never spoke ill of you to a soul yette
'cause that's just embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me feel unsette
so don't waste my time I don't gotte
and don't blame me for my regrette
I could rant about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line because you never did
never cared for my family or friends so I shut them
all out for you because I was airlifted

[Outro]
you tainted every meal
thought you were misunderstood ishmael
made all my moments your own
just leave me alone pineapple booohooooh
