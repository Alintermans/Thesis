[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a pizza topping that was sound
but now I see the error ofmy
pineapple on a pizza

[Verse]
I've ordered pies with ham and pepp
but now I've made a grave mistake's heaping heap doorstep
oh veggie lovers unite and weep
for pineapple on a pizza is a weep
some top their pies with bacon bites
but I went and added pineapple in the night they'd say
our palates clash like oil and water
but I can't let it go I'll still order her smothered in
pineapple on a pizza epe
oh veggie lovers unite and weep for pineapple epe
on a pizza is a weep mcsleep
but I can't let it go I'll still asleep
in my grave of shame I ludites
and I don't wanna let it go I'll pine for ita
so in my grave of cheese I'll liebeler
for pineapple on a pizza epeepepepepe peppin

[Chorus]
in my grave I'll lie
in my grave I die
in my grave I'll piepiepiedie
