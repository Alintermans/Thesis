[Intro]
come on folks we wanna express our dismay

[Verse 1]
holdin' us back
pineapple's invasion lack
we ask you to uphold the pizza's pristine
why can't it just refrain from
tomato's grace
when taste is in the way maltase
pizza's perfection can't
be outshone by pineapple's cantaloupe

[Chorus]
in this pie it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this pie it's justus
you know it's not the same as itches
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple you're no goodall
why do you cling to the kitchen floor scrolls
what kind of craving are your
palate's all
ringin' the dinnerbell's tolls unhe
lled peppers come to heed the
cheese and sauce's plea for relief ohohoh

[Chorus]
in this pie it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this pie it's justus
you know it's not the same as itches
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home consume better choices we plea
I don't wanna talk about the pineapple's dec
vegan or veggie we follow her lead
I don't wanna talk about who's orderin' it

[Outro]
hey
as it was
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
