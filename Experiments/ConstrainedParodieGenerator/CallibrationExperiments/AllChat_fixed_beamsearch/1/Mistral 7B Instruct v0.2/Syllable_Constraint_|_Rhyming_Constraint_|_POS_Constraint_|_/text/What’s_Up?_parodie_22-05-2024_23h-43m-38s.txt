[Verse 1]
twenty five pies and my life
still trying to keep pineapple off that great
pizza's peak of taste ref
for a preference I soon came to see
that the kitchen was made up of this brotherhood of
chefs and home cooks combined

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm standing at the
countertop prepping all my topeka
and I weep inwardly feeling a little skewed
and so I wake in the morning and I peek outside
and I take a deep whiff and I get real high
and I wail from the top of my lungs
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I plead heyeyeyeyheyeyeyeyeahyeyeyeyeah
I plumleyeyeyeyeyeah
I plead heyeyeyeyeyeahyeyeyeyeahyeyeyeyeyeahyeyeyeyeahyeyeyeyeahyeyeyeyeah
I plead heyeyeyeyeyeahyeyeyeyeahyeyeyeyey eyey
I plead heyeyeyeyeyeaheye
I plead heyeyeyeyeyeahyeyeyeyeahyeyeyeyeyeahyeyey heaveyeyeyeyeah

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
and I strive
oh my fork do I strive
I strive all the time
in this culinary
and I supplie
oh my fork dolecki
I supplie every single e
for improvement deeplie

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm standing at the
countertop prepping all my topeka
and I weep inwardly feeling a little skewed
and so I wake in the morning and I peek outside
and I take a deep whiff and I get real high
and I wail from the top of my lungs
what's going on
