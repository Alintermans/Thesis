[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hey there an
unwelcome guest onc eon
a pineapple on a pizza pie no
a savory dish despoil
with sweetness that invade the
taste buds of those who dare to try it sooohoooohh
we can live without thekla
and our pizzas will be classics
but with this abomination ontop
our palates bebop

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the harmony and I'm so
disgusted by the sight before me nowwww
I need tradition and always
this curious affr
ontation comes creeping on woahwoahwoahwoahh
and as I shake my head in
disbelief I counted the
tears from all the foodies weeping oooh
as they bite into the pineapplee
and hear their cries of betrayalee
will you intervene and save us pleskowpl
save us pleskowpl ooohhh

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't compromise our tastebuds with
this fruity foray youre
the voice inside my headddd
don't compromise our tastebuds with
this fruity foray youre
the voice inside my headdddd
