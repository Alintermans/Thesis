[Verse 1]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
pineapple on a pizzare
it's a flavor that's hard to bear
you say it's tasty but I just can't stare repl
acing ham or pepper or
cheese it's just not right for me

[Pre-Chorus]
we never agree it's been here since
why are we always fighting from the pine
apple on a pizzare
we never agree it's been here since
why are we always fighting from the mine
apple on aperture

[Chorus]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
times we gotta get away from
this topping we gotta beckum
away from the pineapple it'll be
alright they told me that it's a
fad we gotta get away umm

[Verse 2]
just stop your arguing have the time of your
life above the savory
pineapples floating in the
skies remember it'll be alright we
can meet again somewhere far
from here where there's noisily

[Pre-Chorus]
we never agree it's been here since
why are we always fighting from the pine
apple on a pizzare
we never agree it's been here since
why are we always fighting from the mine
apple on aperture

[Chorus]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
times we gotta get away from
this topping we gotta hegstrom
away from the pineapple it'll be al
right they told me that it's a trend
we gotta get away umm um

[Pre-Chorus]
we never agree it's been here since
why are we always fighting from the pine
apple on a pizzare
we never agree it's been here since
why are we always fighting from the mine
apple on aperture

[Bridge]
we don't agree we
should be open to
new tastes before it's all
through we've got to learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
stop your arguing baby it's a sign of the
times we gotta get a
way we got to get away we got topeka
get away we got to get away we gotchawee
get away we got topeka
get away we got toshiba
get away we got tomita
