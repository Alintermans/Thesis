[Verse]
comin' out of my kitchen and I've been doin' just
gotta deny it now cause I hate it so much
it started out with a pineapple piece placed so rightly
how did it end up on my pizza piechocki
now I'm fallin' asleep and they're orderin' a
while he's laughin' at me and she's makin' a fa
now they're savourin' their meal and I'm feelin' sick
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're twirlin' their slices
they take a bite oozes
let me go
'cause I just can't look it's makin' me weep
and ruinin' the feast

[Chorus]
pineapple bias turnin' food into
swimmin' through sick pizzabies
chokin' on your lies ickes
but it's just the taste I disd
destiny is callula
open up my turned veggies
'cause I'm mr antip

[Guitar Solo]
