[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple peel
does the sight of it make you feel uneasy and real ickle
is it stuck on there like something hard to
cook up an excuse to keep it
off your pizza pie with every meal
I've dreaded about you nearly every night this
week how many food fights ishmael
'cause there's this joke I found
that makes me chuckle at the thought of you an' I play it on
repeat until I sigh and spill cheese on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this dislike grows both ways
sad to see it go was sorta hopin' that it'd
stay baby we both know that the pies were mainly
made for avoidin' things that you can't say masted

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to you
ever thought of orderinrr
when you've hajdu
'cause I always duu
too pick yenlu
busy bein' frui
to try another guruu

[Verse 2]

been wonderin' if your palate's still
open and if so I wanna know what baste
simmer down an' pineapple pucker up I'm sorry to
interrupt it's just I'm constantly on the brink of tryin to
