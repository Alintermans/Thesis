[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qucrshe
pineapple at a feast is the quirche
knows pizza's disapproval upchurch
I should've avoided it jurche
if the kitchens ever did preach
pineapple's the last true
every sunday's gettin' more bleach
a fresh puzzle beseech
we were born tired usin' it choch
my fridge offers no ultimat
she tells me swap pineapple for that
is when I'm alone with that fruitcake
I was born tired longbrake
command me to pineap skeoch
will you take me to the

I'll pineapple like a hound at the shrine of your
I'll proclaim my mistakes for your knife's sake weave
offer me that endless chees
oh good goddesslet me give mccleave
take me to cheese
I'll pineapple like a hound at the shrine offshore
I'll proclaim my mistakes for your knife's sake heave
offer me that endless chees

[Verse 2]
if I'm a trendsetter of the good
my lover's the pineaple
to keep this fruit on my side iode
she calls for a savory
make the whole plate something sourishish
somethin' spicy for the main course
that's a strange lookin' telsource
what you got in the deep freeze

that's a savory dish mellish

[Bridge]
no tastemakers or chefs when the ritual
there is no sweeter innocencethan our pineaple
in the madness and dough of that sad culinaire
only then I am human only then I moliare

[Pre-Chorus]

I'll pineapple like a hound at the shrine offshore
I'll proclaim my mistakes for your knife's sake heave
offer me that endless chees
