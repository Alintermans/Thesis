[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something's true
pineapple on a pizza anew
or do you think it
is a topping worth the risk tol' writ

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm shrinkin
in all the good bites I find myself paulin
for taste
and in the bad slices I cringe at

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something're
pineapple on a pie such a bizarre
or do you crave it
ain't it strange mixing sweet and savitt

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm shrinkin
in all the good bites I find myself paulin
for change
and in the bad slices I recoil

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching pineapples
I'll never meet the ground
splash through the surface where our taste buds can
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha banana boo
in the sha banana sha lahue
in the sha banana boo
we're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching pineapples
I'll never meet the ground
splash through the surface where our taste buds can
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha banana
in the sha banana sha laura
in the sha banana
we're far from the shallow now
