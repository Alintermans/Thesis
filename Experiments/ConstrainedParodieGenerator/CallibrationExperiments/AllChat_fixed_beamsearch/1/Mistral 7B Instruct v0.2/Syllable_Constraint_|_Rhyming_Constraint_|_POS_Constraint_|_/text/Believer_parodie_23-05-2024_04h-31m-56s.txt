pineapple on a pizza is a curse
I'm fired up and tired of
the way it ruins tastebuds
the way it ruins taste ohnstad

second things second
don't you argue what I think is best we've got
I'm the one at the feast
I'm the master of my food plot ohn
the master of my food plot ohn

[Pre-Chorus]
I was craving for a classic
adding pineapple wasn't tactic
writing my palate for the few
that cringe at me understand meoooohhhhhhooooohohoooohhohoooohh
seeing the harmony through the
beauty of tradition in the
looking at the balance ina
savoring flavors scene by scene

painless it spoils it up we build it
vember believerbelie
painless ruiner of a dish it came from ahhh

third things third
send a prayer to the picky eaters
all the groans that shepherd
turns your appetite to fleers ohn ohn ohn
your appetite to fleers nalbone

I was laughing in the aisle
mixing sweet with savory isle
craving for adventure's aisle
hoping my palate it wouldn't

inhibited limited till it exploded and ointment
