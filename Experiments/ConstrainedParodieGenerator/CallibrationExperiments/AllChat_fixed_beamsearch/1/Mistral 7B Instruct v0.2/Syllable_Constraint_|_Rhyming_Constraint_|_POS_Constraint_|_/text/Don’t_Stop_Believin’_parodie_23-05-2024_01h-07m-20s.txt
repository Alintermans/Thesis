[Verse 1]
just a small pizza townfolkwith their toppings all
they baked the midnight piegoin' anywhere with
a picky eater from the land of cheeseit tookthe
midnight train goin' anywhere with nesmith

[Verse 2]
a party in a cheesy tentthe
aroma of pine andraki
for a bite they can share the feast
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
veggie lovers
round the roundabout table
their shadows frowning in dismaystre
etlights illum
pizzaphiles livin' just to
taste emotion ineptly

[Verse 3]
strugglin' to resist the pine
everyone craves alexine
pays up for a slice of strifeone more
bite could make itp

[Verse 4]
some will thrive with ham and
some will choke on the ackland
oh the debate never ceas
esit goes on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
veggie lovers
round the roundabout table
their shadows frowning in dismaystre
etlights illum
pizzaphiles livin' just to
taste emotion ineptly

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]

etlights pizzaf
olks don't stop belden
keep on to that taste struvve
