[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the quirks
pineapple on ahold
pepperoni and its
pricks and onions roll
but pineapple doesn't
it's a topping that just doesn't fit this plot thickens

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said laughingly turns tome
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some unexpected twist
just something lancome
some traditional
just something I can munch on
something I cannibnal
I want something just normal

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo dadoodoo dadood
doo dadoodoo dad
doo dadoodoo d'etude
oh I want something just normal
doo dadoodoo dadood
doo dadoodoo cad
doo dadoodoo dulude
oh I want something just normal
doo dadoodoo d' ethel

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the quirks
every topping tolled
anchovies and its perks
but pineapple don't
it's a topping that just
it's a topping that just doesn't fit this plot

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said playfully turns to me
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some unexpected twist
just something plainly
some traditionnal
just something I can munch on
something I cannibal

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just normal
doo dadoodoo d' ethel

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just normal
doo dadoodoo dadood
doo dadoodoo dad
doo dadoodoo d'etude
oh I want something just normal
doo dadoodoo dul pood
doo dadoodoo cad
doo dadoodoo dulude

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a pizza
with some unexpected twist
just something lambreau
some classical chees
just something I can munch on
something I canneriese
I want something just ortiz

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just normal
doo dadoodoo dadood dorvale
doo dadoodoo dad dadood cul
