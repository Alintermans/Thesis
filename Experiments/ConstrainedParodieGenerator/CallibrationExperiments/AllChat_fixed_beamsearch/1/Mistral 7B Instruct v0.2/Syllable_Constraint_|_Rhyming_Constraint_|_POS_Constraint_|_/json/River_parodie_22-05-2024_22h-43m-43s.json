He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a fan of pineapple on a pizza's facade for thee\nbut little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it causes is a gastr\ndelight and my dislike now are clashing incur\nso let the debate run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe brings it home with a slice in hand to feast\nwears a frown and tries to please missbe\non his breath's pizza sauce he's the grease\nand she just wants to cease this taste invasion beast\nit's a dance marathon she'll lead him to mideast\nshe's kept track of all his online debates\nand guess who just happens to be taking a stand against\nthe pineapple tyrant's reign supreme and she's got a plan to rearrang\n'cause she hates sweet intruders on\npizza's sacred ground even I know that rule number one\nbut she's cooking up resistance to spoil bankeast\nnightshade in hand says their alliance is hanging by a\nthread so she's been on the web tweet\nsays maybe she'll save me from this pineapple deceitp\nand I know she's using me to rile him upside down I don't\ncare hi suzanne but I shoulda said hambrighte\nafter the first slice but tonight I am\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a fan of pineapple on a pizza's facade for thee\nbut little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it causes is a gastr\ndelight and my dislike now are clashing incur\nso let the debate run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\none night stand turned a two night stand it was\ncome sunrise scram now we cuddle tight hand in handhe\nfound out now she feels deserted and misused\n'cause he left now what I suppose to tell this girl\nit's hard to find the words I'm aloof and nervous pearl\ndon't want this to hurt but what you deserve earl earle\nso I revert to the studio like a hole in the\nwall diner I just feel like the person I'm turning into's a showgirl\nand now with her in the oven we can't bring her in this world shouldve\nused protection before I took achee\nwhy do I do this trick that I do get on my soap\nbox and preach my sermon and speech detergent and bleach cowgirl\n'cause now with her in the womb we can't heimer\nshouldve known before I bit into ebern\nfruit fool fool fool fool fool fool unfurl\ncould've saved us all from this pineapple twirlforg\nI'm sorry I don't want to admit\nto something if all it\ncauses is a gastr delight and my ebern\ndislike now are clashing incurso let the debate runcall\nme\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's oui my name's oui\nriver\noui\nriver run\ncall me oui callouslyi\nriver oui we'll let the debate run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the bridesmaid never the bride hey\nfuck can I say if love was alexei\nand deceit was a fortress I'd be sliding in three ways\nspeeding at a high rate like I'm slipping on ice kidde\nthat's why I may have came at you cross eyed\nI can't serve my lies righte\nbut I made you terminate my pepcid\nthis love triangle left us in a wreck tangled\nwhat else can I say it was fun for a while\nbet I really would've loved your guile\ndidn't really wanna abort but what's one\nmore lie to tell our unborn childruinourl\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a fan of pineapple on a pizza's facade for thee\nbut little one\nI'm sorryie ne\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif it's just\n\na gastr delight and my dislikes\nnow are clashing and cursing so let the ickes\n",
