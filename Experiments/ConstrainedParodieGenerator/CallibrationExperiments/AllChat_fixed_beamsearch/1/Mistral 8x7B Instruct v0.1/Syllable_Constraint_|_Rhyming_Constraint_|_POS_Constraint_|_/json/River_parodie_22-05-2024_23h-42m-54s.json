He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nbeen a hater of the taste combined with mine in time I've seen\nall my sins need holy water feel it washing off this\ncheese that's causing such a fuss in\nthis debate I don't want to admit toppin\npineapple if all its\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home from the grocery store with\ntomato sauce and mozzarell\n'nough to share but wait he's adding pine cones\nshe's disgusted can't believe what she gareth\nshe's a vegan zero meat zero d nesseth\nbut he insists it's a delicacy\nshe says it's a travesty can't believe his naivet\u00e9\nnow they're in a heated debate on what makes a pizza debonair\nif it's sweet or savory\nor if pineapple's a disgrace to the pizza's good name\nhe says it's a game changer she says it' stallsmith\nhe says it's a win she says it's a faileth ithere's\nno convincing her she's on a\nrighteous mission to keep pineapple away from her\nfavorite dish but he's a stubborn man won't give up the fight\nwon't let it go won't admit hewler\non the wrong side of history it's a\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nbeen a hater of the taste combined with mine in time I've seen\nall my sins need holy water feel it washing off this\ncheese that's causing such a fuss in\nthis debate I don't want to admit toppin\npineapple if all it\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na classic margherita turned hawaiin\nit was met with disdain now they hug it out and\nhe tries to convince her to give it a chance\nbut she's still hesitant it's just not the same\nnow how is he supposed to tell this girl that aflame\nit will never be the same as it was before flame\nit's hard to find the words he's aloof nervous and shame ith\ndon't want it to hurt but what she deserves is the truth ithere airframe\ndon't take it personally he just can't say this in person\nto her so he reverts to the rhinesmith\nlike hole in the wall diners don't have to be perse\nvered in a booth he just feels like the person who he's frame\nturning into it's irreversible blame\nfrancis he prayed on her like it's ashame\nand now that he got her he defame\ncan't bring her to this world shoulda known to use\nprotection before he bit into hert\nforbidden fruit fuck ith\nwhat was he thinking it's a curse not a game\nit's time to take responsibility for his own fame ith\nunpl\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's shameful it's a\ndisgruntle\ntopp\nng runrunn\nlet the river runway\ncall me shameful call me achaean\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the bridesmaid never the bride hey\nfudge can I lay if life was afsane\nand pineapple was a crime I'd be serving time ithayes\ndeceit was an enclaved I'd be swerving in five\nlanes speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding\non Ice maybe that's why I\nmay have came at you sideways I cain live\nwith the fact I'm on the wrong side of history\nit's time to take responsibility for\nmy actions and admit that what're\ndoin's wrong ithink it's time to make amends ith\nit was fun while it lasted but it's time to\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker saying pine\non pizza's fineline's\nbeen a hater of the taste combined with mine in time I've seen\nall my sins need\nhol holstein\n\nneed holy water feel it washing off\nthis cheese it\n\noff this cheese that's causing such a\nfuss in this debate I don't want tomita\n",
