[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on my pizza
I won't stand for it no more
it's a travesty gone too far
it's a travesty gone too far

[Verse 2]
second things second
ham and pineapple's a sinister duo claimed
I'm the one who decides
what goes on my pie baked with pride ohh
what goes on my pie borneo

[Pre-Chorus]
I had faith in pizza's puristsre
standing up for tradition and chees
writing my rants on the net wide
those who support pineapple are fools I despise with
pain in my heart from this abom
adding fruit to pizza's a sin
making me yearn to scream whitwam
seeing the beauty in no pine

[Chorus]
pain you gave me a reason to weep
believer in pizza
pain you gave me a reason to weep
believer inertia
pain oh makes me want to scream and weep aloud
my sanity my love my drive it
pain you gave me a reason to weep
believer inserra

[Verse 3]
third things third
say a prayer for pizza purists' souls
ham and pine on ushered
horror and outrage in our roles ohh
horror and outrage inerco

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking in my boots
standing up for pizza disputes
pouring my heart out for the truths
hoping my ranting they would shoots
but they never did never conceded till it boiled
opened my eyes to the stupidity of it all pantsuits
it boiled down like

[Chorus]
pain you gave me a reason to weep
believer in pizza
pain you gave me a reason to weep
believer inertia
pain oh makes me want to scream and weep aloud
my sanity my love my drive it
pain you gave me a reason to weep
believer inserra

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the power of the dough and the sauce
we won't back down or waive
the fight for pizza laws enshrd
the fight for pizza lawyered

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did never conceded till it boiled
opened my eyes to the stupidity of it all pantsuits
it boiled down like

[Chorus]
pain you gave me a reason to weep
believer in pizza
pain you gave me a reason to weep
believer inertia
pain oh makes me want to scream and weep aloud
my sanity my love my drive it
pain you gave me a reason to weep
believer inserra
