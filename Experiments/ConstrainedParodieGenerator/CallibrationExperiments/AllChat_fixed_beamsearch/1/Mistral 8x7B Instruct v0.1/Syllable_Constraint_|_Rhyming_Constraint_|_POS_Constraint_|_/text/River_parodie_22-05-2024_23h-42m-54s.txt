he's comin' home from the grocery store with
tomato sauce and mozzarell
'nough to share but wait he's adding pine cones
she's disgusted can't believe what she gareth
she's a vegan zero meat zero d nesseth
but he insists it's a delicacy
she says it's a travesty can't believe his naivet√©
now they're in a heated debate on what makes a pizza debonair
if it's sweet or savory
or if pineapple's a disgrace to the pizza's good name
he says it's a game changer she says it' stallsmith
he says it's a win she says it's a faileth ithere's
no convincing her she's on a
righteous mission to keep pineapple away from her
favorite dish but he's a stubborn man won't give up the fight
won't let it go won't admit hewler

it was met with disdain now they hug it out and
he tries to convince her to give it a chance
but she's still hesitant it's just not the same

don't want it to hurt but what she deserves is the truth ithere airframe
don't take it personally he just can't say this in person
to her so he reverts to the rhinesmith
like hole in the wall diners don't have to be perse
vered in a booth he just feels like the person who he's frame
turning into it's irreversible blame
francis he prayed on her like it's ashame
and now that he got her he defame

fudge can I lay if life was afsane
and pineapple was a crime I'd be serving time ithayes
deceit was an enclaved I'd be swerving in five
