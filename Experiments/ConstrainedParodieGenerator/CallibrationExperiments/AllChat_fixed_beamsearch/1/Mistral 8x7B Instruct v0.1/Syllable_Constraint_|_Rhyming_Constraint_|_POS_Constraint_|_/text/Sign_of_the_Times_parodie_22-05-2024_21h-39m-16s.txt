[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my plea
it's a culinary sin
your tastebuds will never win
the taste is just not meant to blend with cheese and dough
it's time to face the facts and
admit you made a mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tried this combo out before and
why does it still leave us running from ough
disappointment raw ough
we've tried this combo out beforehand
why does it still leave us fleeing from ow
the bitterness somehow

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and listen to
our rallying cry ighcries
we need to set things right ortiz
put down that pineapple slice and see the
error of your choice ightchoices
we need to flee from this plesseyes

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and join the fun
let's savor flavors true ndertr
melted cheese and pepperonc
remember we will all be better off
we can feast again somewhere
somewhere far from pine orton

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tried this combo out before and
why does it still leave us running from ough
disappointment raw ough
we've tried this combo out beforehand
why does it still leave us fleeing from ow
the bitterness somehow

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and listen to
our rallying cry ightcryiess
we need to set things right ounces
put down that pineapple slice and see the ightc
error of your choice ightchoicesspp
we need to flee from this pledgessss

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tried this combo out before and
why does it still leave us running from ough
disappointment raw ough
we've tried this combo out beforehand
why does it still leave us fleeing from ow
the bitterness somehow

[Bridge]
we don't savor much
we should speak up ightspe
before it's all too muchs
will we ever learn
we've tried this combo
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice and hear our plea
we gotta get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to getawayweget to getawaywe
got to get away we got stay
we got to we got to tuesday
we got to we got to stupay
