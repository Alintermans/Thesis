[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple on your
slice a bitter taste that lingers on your tongue long past done
do you question why it's even on there
does the sweet and savory make
your taste buds run for cover in despair
do you ever ponder why it's on a pizza pair
when it just shouldn't be boulware
there's a sauce andcheese
and toppings galore but pineapple's not the cure for being
bored with pizza anymore spillin' grease on your

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna spit it out or give it a chance
do I want it gone or do I want it to enhance
do I want to scream or do I want to dance done
with this debate on whether pineapple belongs stance

[Chorus]
crawlin' backto the
pizza without pineapple
ever thought to
make itasca
'cause I donahey
too busy enjoyin
the classics without thekla
how I've seen itstee

[Verse 2]
so do you have the nerve
to put pineapple on your slice again
or will you finally learn to reserve verve
for toppings that belong on a pie like ham or sausage
do you have the guts to take a stand against pineapple's reign
or will you forever be a slave to its disdain
do you have the courage to say no to tompane

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna spit it out or give it a chance
do I want it gone or do I want it to enhance
do I want to scream or do I want to dance done
