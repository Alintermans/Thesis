[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love my pie
pineapple on top would fly singe
now in the morning I take a bite
only to find it airtight

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
feel the zest in enemy's eyes disg
eat the pie I thought was fines
now I'm left with canned pine times twos airlines
one bite in and I felt the
pain of pineapples repka
and I discovered that my taste had changed
for sweet and savory rearranged arranged

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear church bells aisle ringin' audible
cheese and tomato choirs are singin
be my lover my baker and
my pizzeria in an open stand
for some reason I can't conceive
once I tasted pineapples
never a tasty dish
but that was when I loved the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a bitter and wild windbld
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered crusts and the sound of sirens
people screaming how I've lost my mind sirs
revolutionaries stayin
for my head on a wooden in
just a victim on a lonely dinnertime
aw who would ever want pineapples

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear church bells aisle ringin' audible
cheese and tomato choirs are singin
be my lover my baker and
my pizzeria in an open stand
for some reason I can't conceive
I know papa john won't approve its
never a tasty dish
but that was when I loved the pie
