[Intro]
come on folks, it's time to speak the truth verse 1 p

[Verse 1]
taste so wrong doomed
pineapple on pizza' boomed
I want you to keep it off your plate my friend
why would you even assume it
fruit's out of place
when veggies take the base lactase
intolerant folks will still
give you an earful till you're chillin' ohh

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same with pine on
in this world it' aegus
you know it's not the same with yaohan
with pineapple oran
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
dial the chef
tell him pineapple youssef
why add it to a dish that's supreme de
resist the tempt to tweet your
approval heed
it's not a topping to be freed
ham and cheese is all you need
it's a classic combo indeed ohh ohh ohh

[Chorus]
in this world it's just us
you know it's not the same with pine on
in this world it' aegus
you know it's not the same with yaohan
with pineapple oran
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
stay with classics just fine speed internett
don't wanna talk about pineapple's weirdness yett
move on folks it's just a trendy thinggahh
don't wanna talk about fruit's weird additiongahhhh

[Outro]
heyyyyy
as it wisnt
you know it's not the same as it wisnt
as it wisnt wisnt wisnt wisnt
