[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to say no to pine
on my pizza slice at last me thinks
can't believe I ever
gave itchy

[Verse]
I've tasted two tastes that I abh
r pineapple and ham in a dish sincerely ahab
oh man what a shame the taste I disd
if I could spit It out pronto no would I
some think it's a delicacy
but I beg to differ and push it away in dismay
well improper pairings break tastebuds
so I'll stick to my ways I won't partake I won't budge
I've tasted two tastes that I abh
r pineapple and ham in a dish sincerely ahab
oh man what a shame the taste I disd
if I could spit it out pronto no hawai
some think it's a delicacy
but I beg to differ and push it away inouye
well improper pairings break tastebuds
so I'll stick to my ways I won't partake I won't budge

[Chorus]
I'll rot I rot rot
I'll rot I potshot
I'll rot I rot rotrotrot
