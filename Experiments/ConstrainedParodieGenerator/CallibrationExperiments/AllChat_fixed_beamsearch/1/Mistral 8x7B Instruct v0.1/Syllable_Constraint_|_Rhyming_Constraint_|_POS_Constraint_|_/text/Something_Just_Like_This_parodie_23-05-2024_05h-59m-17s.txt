[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading tales of old
of pizza toppin' folkl
but pineapple bechthold
should never grace that roll
anchovies' salty
and pepperonI's bold
and clearly I don't see pineapple in that fold

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said won't you try it
won't you take that risk
I'm not looking for a pinepple
on my pizza slice oh miss

no sweetness to entw
just something I can bite to
