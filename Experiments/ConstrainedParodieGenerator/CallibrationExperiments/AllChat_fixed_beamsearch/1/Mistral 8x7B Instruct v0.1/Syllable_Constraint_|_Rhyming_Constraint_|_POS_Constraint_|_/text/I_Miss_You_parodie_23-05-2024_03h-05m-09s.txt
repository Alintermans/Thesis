[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, idivrr

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
greetings there
the thorn from my dinnerware
the garnish on the side of the dumpster
the unwelcome intruder
at my pizza feast tonight
we can't abide by pineapple's rule if
we don't want our night
to taste like a mistake we can't
undo tonight tonight tonight we'll wish
this taste would leave anguish

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the ham that used to be here
I cannot take this sweetened bread tonight
I need something savory and
this tropical fruit
brings cringing on at every bite tonight
and as I savor I am
no longer craving this monst
rosy sweetness ruining my slice
like reluctance to send it back
and end this disgrace tonight
end this disgrace tonight and now airtight
is my stance onsite

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
take your time on me I won't be here long
the taste of pineapples
I despise it I desp
take your time on me I won't be here long
the taste of pine apples
I despise it I desp

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
take your time on me I won't be here long
the taste of pineapples
I despise it I desp
take your time on me I won't be here long
the taste of pine apples
I despise it I desp
take your time on me I won't be here long
the taste of pineapples
I despise it I desp
take your time on me I won't be here long
the taste of pineapples
I despise it I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp
