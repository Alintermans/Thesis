[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottle in hand is all I require
started with a slice that seemed so benign πrime πrime πrime so
it was just pineapple nothing more πrime soho
now I'm full of regret and my stomach's in a
knot as I recall that fateful nightmarescream
why'd I let them put that sweet and sour on ern
and my pizza pie oughn

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're slicing it up now
I take a step back boww
please let me
for I just can't bear to see it go
it's driving me bonk

[Chorus]
disappointment souring victory
serving up a plate of treach
painful to accept inspeech
but it's just the toll I pay
posterity won teply
keep away my eager reach
for I mr bright

[Guitar Solo]
