[Verse 1]
just a small town slicesquished on a cheesy
dish so wrong it'll make you weep and whine and
just a city boy who's never had a nibble
he took a bite and couldn't help but fredlund

[Verse 2]
a chef in a greasy diner
the taste of pineapple andler
for a grimace they can share the
grief it goes on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza haters
linin' up and down the block
their disgusted faces searchin
lights ablazin
livin' just to spit out disdain
hidin' somewhere in thelin

[Verse 3]
kneadin' dough with might and main
hopin' that the taste refrain
crossin' fingers for a savory
not a sickly

[Verse 4]
some may like the sweetness
but it's just not inertness
oh the horror never quits
it lingers on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza haters
linin' up and down the block
their disgusted faces searchin
lights ablazin
livin' just to spit out disdain
hidin' somewhere in thelin

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop detestin
hold on to that hatin
pizza lights abl
don't stop detestin
hold on
pizza lights abl
don't stop detestin
hold on to that hollin
pizza lights abl
