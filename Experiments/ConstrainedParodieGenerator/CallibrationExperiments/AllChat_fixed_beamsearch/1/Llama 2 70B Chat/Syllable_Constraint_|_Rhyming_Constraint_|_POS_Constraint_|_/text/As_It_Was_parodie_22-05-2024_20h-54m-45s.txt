come on pineappleheads we wanna say goodbye

[Verse 1]
holdin' us back
pineapples on piggyback
we want you off the menu now don't you

fit in with the
flavors that we love sovereignty
and our tastebuds can
never be replaced oh oh oh won't

you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pivots
you know it's not the same as itches
as it was asmaras

dough daddy lives by hisselff
he just wants to know that you're swell oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of pizzaits
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pivots
you know it's not the same as itches
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same
