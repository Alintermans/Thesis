[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I crave you I crave you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapples
the pizza topping myrtles
the sauce in the background of the bite unple
the unsuspecting pizza
of culinary crimes in
we can dine like cavemen if we must hehe
where you can always pumpkin
and we'll have luau on thanksgiving
and in the bites we'll wish this never ends
we'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I crave you I crave you
I crave you I crave you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor and I'm so
sorry I cannot taste it tonight hehe
I need pizza and always more
this sick strange sweetness
comes pouring on so nauseating all the
time and as I chew I've had
the slices with the toppings
catching flavors and ruining their
insides like indigestion to
call you and hear your voice of
treason will you stop your reign ofc
pain tonight andy

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't ruin your pizza with that topping
already the flavor
I crave you I crave you
don't ruin your pizza with that toeing
already theater
I crave you I crave you

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't ruin your pizza with that topping
already the flavor
I crave you I crave you
don't ruin your pizza with that toeing
already theater
I crave you I crave you
don't ruin your pizza with that towing
already theodor
I crave you I crave you
don't ruin your pizza with that toying
already thelander
I crave you I crave you

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I crave you I crave you
I crave you I crave you
I crave you I cebu
I crave you I cuckoo
