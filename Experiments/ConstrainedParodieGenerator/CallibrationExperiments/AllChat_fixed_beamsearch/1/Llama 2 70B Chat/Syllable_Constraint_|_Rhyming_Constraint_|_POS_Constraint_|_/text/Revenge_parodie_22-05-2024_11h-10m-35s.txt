[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a way to forgive pineapp
for the pizza crimes it's committed
I think that's the first step right
you agree

[Verse]
I've dug a hole for pineapple
can't pretend that it's a topping that's worthwhile heckle
oh man what a flavor the things it
makes me want to do unspeakable things unspe
some say pineapple on pizza
breaks the taste buds breaks the mold makes me cold so cold so cold
and you'd have thought that I would let it slide
and let pineapple pizza glide but no I won't abide
I've dug a hole for pinealple cul
can't pretend that it's a topping that's worthwhile heckel
oh man what a flavor the things it
makes me want to do unspeakable things unspe
some say pineapple onoda
breaks the taste buds breaks the mold makes me cold so cold so cold
and you'd have thought that I would let it slide
and let pineapple pizza glide but no I won't abide

[Chorus]
in my stomach it
in my stomach it
in my stomach it rots rots
in my stomach it
in my stomach it rots lots
in my stomach it

[Outro]
in my stomach it
I'll rot I'll rot I' get
is pineapple pizza
is all of our taste heiwa
pineappple
