[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' while we're out doin' somethin
the thought of it just doesn't sit right with
me an' I can't help but feel
like it's a crime against humanitys
I've tried to ignore it but it's just too much to bear
how can you stand the taste andes
the smell that lingers
it's like you're tryin' to ruin the sanctity of pizza
with your hawaiian abomination an' it

[Pre-Chorus]
do you know how wrong it is to put that on a
pizza do you know how many people you're hurtin
baby we both know that pineapple don't go
with cheese an' tomato sauce they just don't blondin

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to you
ever thought of cookin' somth
you've had anew
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
busy lovin' peet
to fall for your pettigrew
now I've thought it through
crawlin' back tofu

[Verse 2]
so have you got the guts
to put that pineapple on your pizza
an' if so I wanna know what time dockets
shut so I can avoid it like the plague an' not risk it
I don't know if you feel the same as I do but pineappl
on pizza is a no go for me an' you cargal
but we could be together if you wanted al

[Pre-Chorus]
do you know how wrong it is to put that on a
pizza do you know how many people you're hurtin
baby we both know that pineapple don't go
with cheese an' tomato sauce they just don't blondin

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to you carvin' back to you
ever thought of cookin' somth

'cause I always do baby we outgrew
maybe I'm too busy lovin' peet to
fall for your pettigrew now ive
thought it through crawlin' back to

[Outro]
do you wanna know how I feel about pineappl
on pizza do you wanna know how I feel about
your hawaiian pizza dreams do you want me craw
lin' back to you with a pepperoni in handout
do you wanna know how I feel about your pineappl

pineappl on pizza it's a no from me do you want to
