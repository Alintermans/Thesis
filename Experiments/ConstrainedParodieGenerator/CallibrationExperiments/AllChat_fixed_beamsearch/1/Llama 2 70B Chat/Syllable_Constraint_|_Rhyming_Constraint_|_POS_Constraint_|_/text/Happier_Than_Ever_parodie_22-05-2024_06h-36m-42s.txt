[Chorus]
when I see pineappleon
my pizza I start to moan
I wish I could explain nalbone
I wish it tuckerman

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to collect my thoughtsonline at
to write myself arafat
to tell me why it doesn't
belong on my pizza flatb
do you read the recipe right
or do you just wing it ebright
when you said you were hawaiin
was I even on your mindbite I knew weisheit
when I asked you to stop adding plowright
you'd do the opposite of what you said you would doand I'd end up beef8
don't say it isn't fair
you clearly weren't aware
that you made me miserable with your pineapple
so if you really want to know

[Chorus]
when I'm away from pineapple when I'm away
