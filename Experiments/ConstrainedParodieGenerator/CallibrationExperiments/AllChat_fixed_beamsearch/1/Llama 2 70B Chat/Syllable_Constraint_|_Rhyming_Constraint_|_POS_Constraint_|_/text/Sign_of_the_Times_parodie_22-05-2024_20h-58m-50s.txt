[Verse 1]
just stop your whining it's a sign of the times
don't put pineapple pearls
on a pizza that's just not right
it's like putting kale in a milkshake tonight down
you can top it with cheese and
pepperoni that's just fine

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we've had pizza for
centuries why do we keep on trying
to put weird toppings on
it's time to draw the line onlooker
we never learn we've had pizza forging
centuries why doggone

[Chorus]
just stop your whining it's a sign of the times
we got to get back to the bas
ics we got to get back bypass
just stop your whining it's a sign of the
times we got to get back to the
basics we got to get back pass

[Verse 2]
just stop your whining have a slice of your life
topping it with pineapple
ain't gonna make it rightm
things may look pretty good icious icious
but pizza ain't no fruit
salad it just don't mix

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we've had pizza for
centuries why do we keep on trying
to put weird toppings on
it's time to draw the line onlooker
we never learn we've had pizza forging
centuries why doggone

[Chorus]
just stop your whining it's a sign of the times
we got to get back to the bas
ics we got to get back bypass
just stop your whining it's a sign of the times
we got to get back to the bas
ics we got to get back bumpass

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn we've had pizza for
centuries why do we keep on trying
to put weird toppings on
it's time to draw the line onlooker
we never learn we've had pizza forging
centuries why doggone

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
we should open upt
about pizza topped with
fruit before it's all
too late will we eve
learn we've been here be

[Outro]
stop your whining baby it's a sign of the times
we got to get back to
the basics we got to get back in line wanta
get back in line wanta get back in line wanta
get back in line wanta get a
get back in line wanta get a
get back in line wanta get a
