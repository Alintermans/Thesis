[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater, been a troll
been a liar, been a role
all my pineapples need a crustacean washing over me
well little pizza I don't want to admit to thing
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the pineapple

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his stomach aching to
catch some flak for his pizza mistre
on his breath's the scent of hawaiian
and she just wants to give him a piece of hera
it's a messy situation she's onoda
she's kept track of all his pineapple tweets
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually just shit on my last slice and she has what my ex lacks
'cause she loves anchovies psychop
and you don't fuck with no man's pizza even I know
that but she's devised some plan to take him down a
pizza without pineapple is like a sin hangin' from
a strand so she's been on the web
says maybe she'll be my pineapple gwen stacy to
spite her man and I know she's using me to try to play him I
don't care hi suzanne but I should aura
said bye suzanne after the first bight but

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater been a roast
been a liar been a toast
all my pineapples need a crustacean washing over me
well little pizza I don't want to admit to thing
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the grain
so let the pineapple

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one pizza stand turned into a two
night stand it was come sunlight scram now we hug tight
and he found out now she feels deserted and
used cause he left so what he did it first to
her too now how am I supposed to tell this girl you
we're through it's hard to find the words I'm aloysia
nervous and sue don't want this to hurt but what you des
serve is the truth don't take it personal I just can't say disa
person to you so I revert to the studio like hole in the
wall diners don't have to be salleh
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
is irreversible I preyed on you like it's church ina
pew and now that I got you I donata
want you took advantage in myrilla
why do I do this dirt that ira
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speechs
degenerates and bleach is burnin' the
wound cause now with her in
the womb we can't bring her in this world knew
shoulda used protection before I bit into your forebode
food

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a hater been a roast
been a liar been a toast
all my pineapples need a crustacean washing over me
well little pizza I don't want to admit to thing
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the grain
so let the pineapple

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hei
fuck can I say if life was a houyh dai
and deceit was an inclave I'd be serving in five lanes
speedin at a high rate like I'm glidin on ice mayb
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies strait
but I made you terminate my mccabe
this pineapple triangle left us in a rek
tangled what else can I say it was fun for
a while bet I really woodpecker
smile didn't really wanna abort but fuh
what's one more lie to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a hater been a roast
been a liar been a toast
all my pineapples need a crustacean washing over me
well little one
I donny
want to admit to thing if all it's gun
cause pain the
truth and my lies now are falling
like the rain so let the pineapple run punching
down will not beeferman
