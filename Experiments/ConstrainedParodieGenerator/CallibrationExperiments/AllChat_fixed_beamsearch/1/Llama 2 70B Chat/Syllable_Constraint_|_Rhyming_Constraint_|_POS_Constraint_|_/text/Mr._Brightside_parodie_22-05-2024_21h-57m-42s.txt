[Verse]
comin' out of my kitchen and I've been cookin' just
gotta gotta be real because I want it all
it started out with a pineapple how did it end up
like this it was only a pineapple canup
now I'm fallin' asleep and my taste buds are call
while he's eatin' a slice and she's takin' a chew
now they're goin' to town and my stomach is sick
and it's all in my sauce

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's touchin' his crust now
he takes off her muenchow
let me go
'cause I just can't eat it it's killin' me
and takin' control

[Chorus]
pineapple pizza turnin' taste buds to
ruin swimmin' through cheesy
excuses chokin' myrlie
but it's just the price I pay
appetite is callula
open up my eagerly
'cause I'm mr brussel

[Guitar Solo]
