[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me somethin
is pineapple on your pizza fine
or do you need more
like a fresh veggie that's truly shore

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm callin
in all the good slices I want myelin
for cheese
and in the bad ones I fear the freeze

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me somethin
boy arent you tired of that hawaiin
or do you need more
aint it hard keepin it so bangalore

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in all the good slices I find myself ling
for cheese
and in the bad ones I fear the freeze

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
im off the deep end watch as I dive in
ill never meet the sauce
crash through the crust where they cant hurt us were far
from the shallot now no haw

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow in
the sha ha sha la la la laurin
in the sha ha shallow inn
we're far from the shallot now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh hah ah hah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
im off the deep end watch as I dive in
ill never meet the sauce
crash through the crust where they cant hurt us were far
from the shallot now no haw

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow
in the sha ha sha la laureano
in the sha haavelmo
we're far from the shallot now
