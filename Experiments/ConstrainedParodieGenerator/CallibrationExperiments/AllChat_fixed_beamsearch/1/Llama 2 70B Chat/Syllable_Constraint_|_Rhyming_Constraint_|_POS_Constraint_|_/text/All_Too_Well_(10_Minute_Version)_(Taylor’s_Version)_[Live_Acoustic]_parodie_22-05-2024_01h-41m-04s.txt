[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong it was
like a crime scene without a care they sliced their

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my eager gaze worlds collides
we're ordering like kings up at the counter
pepperoni and sausage falling down like rainb
o and I can picture it all in bromides

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that flavor's not here no more
and I might be okay but my tastebuds are
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost spilled the sauce because you were looking high at me
cheese in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter your stomach was growling red
you used to be a little kid with a big appetite instead bed
and your mother's telling stories bout you eating all the cheese
you told me bout your cravings thinking your future was
me and you were tossing me the slice saying fuck thest ices
key chain on the ground we were always skipping town
and I was thinking on the drive down any time now
hes gonna say its love you never called it what it wastl
til we were dead and gone and froze
check the menu and come back swearing its the
same after three slices in
and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
but all I felt was pain and you held my lif elfie

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know its long gone and
there was nothing else I could dottt
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed tot

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we're dancing round the kitchen in the microwave lighty
down the hatch I was there
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobodynhad to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oathhhtbhtbhbhbhbhbhbhbhbhbhbhbhbhbhbhbhbhb
sacred prayer and swissair
to remember it all too well yeahhhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbhtbht

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translatione
maybe I ordered for too
much but maybe this pizza was a mastr
piece till you tore it
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to hangry me like a puzze
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up receipt lying heresausee
cause I remember it all all

[Verse 4]
they say alls well that ends well but this meal is in a
new hell every time you double cross
my tastebuds mind you said if we had been closer in spice maybe
it would have been fine and that
made me want to die the idea you had
of me who was she a never needy ever lovely jewel whose cheese
reflects on you not weeping in a
party bathroomactress asking herpes
what happened you thatshs
what happened you you who charmed my stomach with
self effacing jokes sipping soda like youre on
a late night show but then he watched me watch the fridge all night willing
you to come and he said its supposed to be fun turning

[Verse 5]
twenty one time won't fly its like I'm paralm
itsed by it I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still ul
trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when
you made me your own now you mail back mccowinmywn
things and I walk home alone but you keep my old
topping from that very first slice cause it reminds you
of innocence it smells ul
like me you can't get rid of it

[Chorus]
cause there we are again when I loved you
so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well wind in my hair you was
there you remember it
all down the stairs you was
there you remember it
all it was rare I was
there I remember the chaloux

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punchline gees
I'll get older but your pizza stays my age
from when your pie crust broke my diet and
bones I'm a soldier who's returning half her
weight and did the oven bruise paint you
blue just between us did the love affair maheu
too cause in this city's bar
I still remember the first slice of cheese
and how it melted as it gees
I remember it all too gees

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too ell
just between us I remember it just between us all farwellll
