[Verse 1]
first things first
I got a message that's burning in me
I'm fired up and tired of
the way that pizza's been neglect
the way that pizza's been unchecked

[Verse 2]
second thing's second
don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one with the sauce
I'm the master of my melted cheese
the master of my art chevies

[Pre-Chorus]
I was confused by the toppings
taking my anger to the masses
writing my lyrics for the few
that look at me took to me shook at me feeling mem
singing from indigestion from
the grease taking my message fromve
speaking my lesson from ankrum
seeing the beauty through the cheese

[Chorus]
cheese you made me a you made me a
believer believer
cheese you break me down you build me up
believer belabor
cheese oh let the pepperonis fly oh let
them rain my life my love my drive it
came from cheese you made me aaaa bella
believer cheeseburger

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the ones up above
all the hate that ushered
has turned your spirit to a clove oh ooh
your spirit up above oh ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was choking in the crowd
building my rage up in m houd
falling like pepperonis to
the ground hoping my feelings they
would drown but they never did ever live ivid flow
inhibited limited till it broke open andante
down it rained down

[Chorus]
cheese you made me a you made me a
believer believer
cheese you break me down you build me up
believer belabor
cheese oh let the pepperonis fly oh let
them rain my life my love my drive it
came from cheese you made me aaaa bella
believer cheeseburger

[Verse 4]

by the grace of the oven and the breadst
you're the face of the future
the blood in my veins oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]

hibited limited till it broke open and rained down it
