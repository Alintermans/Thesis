[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza
toppings would shine so bright and clear
now it's just a sad sight too many
toppings that make mehaffey

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to be the king
of the pizza scene my tastebudsw
listen as the crowd would cheer
now they just laugh and make fun of me steer
one minute I held the slice
next it fell and lost its vice
and I discover that my cravings stand
upon aversions of pineapple inland

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringing disg
bbq chicken choirs are clucking
be my mirror my slice and cheese
my missionaries in a cul daisies
for some reason I can't explain
once you're done there's never aain
never an honest slice
and that's when I ruled the pizza

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild crave
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered slices and the sound of sauce
people couldn't believe what I'd chooseauce
revolutionaries wait
for my slice on a silverplate
just a puppet on a lonely string oooh oooh
ahh who would ever wanna be king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringing disg
bbq chicken choirs are clucking
be my mirror my slice and cheese
my missionaries in a cul daisies
for some reason I can't explain
I know st pizza won't call my nameeee
never an honest slice
but that's when I ruled the pizza
