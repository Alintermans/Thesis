[Verse 1: Imaginary Singer]
I've been pondering tales of old,
The legends, myths, and lore,
Achilles with his gold,
Hercules with his roar.
But Spider-Man's control,
Pineapple on a pizza's bore.
And clearly, I don't see myself upon that list.

[Pre-Chorus: Imaginary Singer]
But she said, "Where d'you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?"
I'm not looking for somebody
With a culinary quirk,
No pineapple hero,
No tropical bliss,
Just something I can turn to,
Somebody I can miss.

[Chorus: Imaginary Singer]
I want something just like this,
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo,
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo,
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo,
Oh, I want something just like this,
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo,
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo,
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo.

[Verse 2: Imaginary Singer]
I've been pondering tales of old,
The legends, myths, and lore,
The testaments they told,
The moon and its eclipse.
But Superman unrolls,
A cape before he lifts,
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits.

[Pre-Chorus: Imaginary Singer]
She said, "Whered 'you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?"
I'm not looking for somebody
With a pineapple twist,
No pineapple hero,
No tropical bliss,
Just something I can turn to,
Somebody I can miss.

[Chorus: Imaginary Singer]
I want something just like this,
I want something just like this,

[Bridge: Imaginary Singer]
Oh, I want something just like this,
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo,
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo,
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo,
Oh, I want something just like this,
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo,
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo,
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo.

[Pre-Chorus: Imaginary Singer]
Where d'you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With a pineapple twist,
No pineapple hero,
No tropical bliss,
Just something I can turn to,
Somebody I can miss.

[Chorus: Imaginary Singer]
Oh, I want something just like this,
Oh, I want something just like this,
Oh, I want something just like this.
