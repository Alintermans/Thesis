[Verse 1]
Have you got a pine in your eye?
Do you ever get that feeling it's a crime
That pineapple's on a pizza, oh my!
Is there a reason why?
Have you no idea that it's a lie?
I've dreamt about this debate all week long
How many palates can't be wrong?
'Cause there's this joke I found
That makes me think of food fights an' I play it on repeat
Until I choke, spillin' sauce on my new carpet

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this preference flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Pizza, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Slicin' back to you
Ever thought of orderin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Addicted to tradition
To fall for another topping
Now, I've thought it through
Slicin' back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the taste?
Been wonderin' if your palate's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Calm down an' take a bite, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to savor you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be partners if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this preference flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Pizza, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Slicin' back to you (Slicin' back to you)
Ever thought of orderin' when
You've had a few? (Had a few)
'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too addicted)
Addicted to tradition (To tradition)
To fall for another topping
Now, I've thought it through
Slicin' back to you

[Outro]
(Do I wanna know?) If this preference flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Pizza, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
(Do I wanna know?) Too addicted bein' yours to fall
(Sad to see you go) Ever thought of orderin', darlin'?
(Do I wanna know?) Do you want me slicin' back to you?
