[Verse 1]
25 slices, and my pizza's still
Tryin' to find a place where pineapple doesn't chill
On my plate, I realized quickly when I knew I should,
That this topping's presence ruins the brotherhood,
Of savory flavors, for whatever that means,

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I groan sometimes when I'm taking a bite,
Just to get it all out, what's not right,
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar,
And so I slice in the morning and I step outside,
And I take a deep breath and I get real high,
And I scream from the top of my lungs,
"What's going on?"

[Chorus]
And I say, hey-ey-ey,
Hey-ey-ey,
I said "Hey, pineapple, what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey,
Hey-ey-ey,
I said "Hey, pineapple, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey,
(Slice in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey-ey,
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, pineapple, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey,
(Slice in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah,
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, pineapple, a-what's going on?"

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh,
Ooh,
Ooh, uh huh,
Ooh, ooh,
Ooh,
Ooh, uh huh,

[Verse 2]
And I try, oh my God, do I try,
I try all the time,
In this kitchen,
And I plea, oh my God, do I plea,
I plea every single day,
For a change,

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I groan sometimes when I'm taking a bite,
Just to get it all out, what's not right,
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar,
And so I slice in the morning and I step outside,
And I take a deep breath and I get real high,
And I scream from the top of my lungs,
"What's going on?"

[Chorus]
And I say, hey-ey-ey,
Hey-ey-ey,
I said "Hey, pineapple, what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey,
Hey-ey-ey,
I said "Hey, pineapple, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey,
(Slice in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey-ey,
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, pineapple, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey,
(Slice in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah,
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, pineapple, a-what's going on?"

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh,
Ooh,
Ooh, uh huh,
Ooh, ooh,
Ooh,
Ooh, uh huh,

[Outro]
25 slices and my pizza's still,
Tryin' to find a place where pineapple doesn't chill,
For savory flavors, mmm.
