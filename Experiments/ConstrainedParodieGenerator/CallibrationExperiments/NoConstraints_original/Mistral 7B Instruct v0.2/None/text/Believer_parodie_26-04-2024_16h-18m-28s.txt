[Verse 1]
First things first, I'll state my case, you see
Pineapple on pizza, it just doesn't agree, oh-ooh
Pineapple on pizza, it just doesn't agree, oh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Second things second, don't force your taste on me, you know
I'm the one with the palate, I'll choose what I'll grow, oh-ooh
I'm the one with the palate, I'll choose what I'll grow, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was craving for a classic pie
Topped with tomatoes, cheese, and olives, oh my
But then they added pineapple, it just didn't feel right
My taste buds rebelled, they put up a fight, oh-ooh

[Chorus]
Pineapple! You've spoiled my, you've spoiled my
Craving, craving
Pineapple! You've tainted my, you've tainted my
Palate, palate
Pineapple! Oh, let the debates ensue, oh, let them brew
My love for pizza, it came from…
Pineapple! You've spoiled my, you've spoiled my
Craving, craving

[Verse 3]
Third things third, let's give tradition a chance
Pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms, they're the perfect dance, oh-ooh
Pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms, they're the perfect dance, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was dreaming of a savory delight
Topped with veggies, meats, and spices, oh what a sight
But then they added pineapple, it just didn't blend
My taste buds were confused, they couldn't comprehend, oh-ooh

[Chorus]
Pineapple! You've spoiled my, you've spoiled my
Craving, craving
Pineapple! You've tainted my, you've tainted my
Palate, palate
Pineapple! Oh, let the debates ensue, oh, let them brew
My love for pizza, it came from…
Pineapple! You've spoiled my, you've spoiled my
Craving, craving

[Verse 4]
Last things last, let's keep it simple and true
Cheese, sauce, and toppings, that's all it's meant to do, oh-ooh
Cheese, sauce, and toppings, that's all it's meant to do, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

[Chorus]
Pineapple! You've spoiled my, you've spoiled my
Craving, craving
Pineapple! You've tainted my, you've tainted my
Palate, palate
Pineapple! Oh, let the debates ensue, oh, let them brew
My love for pizza, it came from…
Pineapple! You've spoiled my, you've spoiled my
Craving, craving
