[Verse 1]
Now I've heard there was a secret topping,
Pineapple, some say it's not worth the popping,
But you don't really care for pizza, do ya?
It goes like this, the first, the sixth,
The savory fall, the sweet lift,
The baffled chef composing "Hallelujah"

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,

[Verse 2]
Your palate was strong, but you sought the proof,
You tasted pineapple on the roof,
Its sweetness in the oven overthrew ya,
They added it to your pizza pie,
They sliced your favorite toppings goodbye,
And from your plate they drew the Hallelujah.

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,

[Verse 3]
You say I took the pepper in vain,
I don't even know the name,
But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya?
There's a blaze of flavor in every bite,
It doesn't matter which you sight,
The classic or the controversial Hallelujah.

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,

[Verse 4]
I did my best, it wasn't much,
I couldn't taste, so I tried to touch,
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya,
And even though it all went wrong,
I'll stand before the lord of dish,
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah.

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

[Outro]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,

[Additional Lyrics]
Baby, I've been here before,
I know this pie, I've tasted this lore,
I used to love alone before I knew you,
And I've seen your pineapple on the marble arch,
Love is not a victory dish,
It's a cold and it's a controversial Hallelujah.

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you let me know,
What's really going on below,
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you,
The classic toppings were moving too,
And every bite we drew was Hallelujah.

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a chef above,
But all I've ever learned from love,
Was how to order someone who outdrew you,
And it's not a cry that you hear at night,
It's not somebody who's seen the light,
It's a cold and it's a controversial Hallelujah.
