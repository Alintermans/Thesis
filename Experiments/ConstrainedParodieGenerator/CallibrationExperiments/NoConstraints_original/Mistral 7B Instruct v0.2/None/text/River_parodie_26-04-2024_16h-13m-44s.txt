[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, been a prankster
Been a lover, been a jinx
All my sins need pineapple, feel it mixing in the mix
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is strife
The truth and my lies now are swirling like the pineapple on the knife
So let the pizza spin

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
He's bringing home a pineapple, to create a ruckus
Toppings clash, it's a mess, mismatched
On his breath's beer, he's a pineapple addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a battle, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his online chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just sliced up my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she hates pineapple, psychopath
And you don't mess with no one's pizza, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to sabotage his dish
Pineapple in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my pepperoni, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first slice, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, been a prankster
Been a lover, been a jinx
All my sins need pineapple, feel it mixing in the mix
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is strife
The truth and my lies now are swirling like the pineapple on the knife
So let the pizza spin

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
A one-slice stand turned a two-slice stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels betrayed and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Pineapple-crazy, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this pineapple that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'Cause now with her in the oven
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Snoop Dogg]
I've been a joker, been a prankster
Been a lover, been a jinx
All my sins need pineapple, feel it mixing in the mix
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is strife
The truth and my lies now are swirling like the pineapple on the knife
So let the pizza spin

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)
Pizza 
(Ooh)
, pizza spin
Call me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)
Pizza (Ooh), we'll let the pizza spin

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If pizza was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Snoop Dogg]
I've been a joker, been a prankster
Been a lover, been a jinx
All my sins need pineapple, feel it mixing in the mix
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is strife
The truth and my lies now are swirling like the pineapple on the knife
So let the pizza spin
