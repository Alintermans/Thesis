[Intro]
I think I, I think I finally
Found a reason to stand firm
Against the pineapple on my pie, my friend
Can't pretend it's just a whim
You agree?

[Verse]
I've sliced two pies for us, my dear
Can't pretend that taste is clear
Oh, food, what a world, the things I fear
If I could change the recipe, no, would I?
Some add, some spice, some twist your knife
And you'd have thought that I would let it slide
But pineapple on pizza, it's a crime
And I don't wanna let it slide, so in my mind, I'll grime
I've sliced two pies for us, my dear
Can't pretend that taste is clear
Oh, food, what a world, the things I fear
If I could change the recipe, no, would I?
Some add, some spice, some twist your knife
And you'd have thought that I would let it slide
But pineapple on pizza, it's a crime
And I don't wanna let it slide, so in my mind, I'll grime

[Chorus]
In my mind, I'll grime
In my mind, I'll grime
In my mind, I'll grime-ime-ime
In my mind, I'll grime
In my mind, I'll grime-ime-ime
In my mind, I'll grime
[Outro]
In my mind, I'll grime
I'll grime, I'll grime, I'll grime
Is my dislike your delight?
Is all of my dislike your delight?
Enjoy.
