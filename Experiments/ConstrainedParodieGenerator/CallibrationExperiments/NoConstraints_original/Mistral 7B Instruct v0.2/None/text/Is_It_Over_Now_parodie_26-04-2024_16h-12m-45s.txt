[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the pizza was baked (Uh-huh)
With pineapple's sweet mistake (Uh-huh)
I savored alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't take

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred slices later (Oh)
I see your face and your scowl on unsuspecting pizza makers (Oh, no)
You dream of my pie before it called you a pineapple traitor (Oh)
You search in every gourmet's kitchen for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she placed pineapple on your pizza?
Was it over when he added ham and bacon to mine?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you lost your taste (Uh-huh)
Pineapple, savory waste (Uh-huh)
Hawaiian on a plate (Uh-huh)
Your new dish is my hate

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my pizzas out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my pepperoni and cheese
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
A veggie delight
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pepperoni-less pies later (Oh)
If she's got mushrooms, I will surmise that you'll probably dislike her (Oh, no)
You dream of my pie before it called you a pineapple traitor (Oh)
You search in every vegetarian's kitchen for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she placed pineapple on your pizza?
Was it over when he added ham and bacon to mine?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my pizzas out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my pepperoni and cheese
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
A veggie delight
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
