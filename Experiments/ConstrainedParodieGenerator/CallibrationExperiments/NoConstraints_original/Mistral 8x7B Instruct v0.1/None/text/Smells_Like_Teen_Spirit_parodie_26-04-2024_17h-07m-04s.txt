[Verse 1]
Load up on cheese, grab a slice
Pineapple on pizza, it's not nice
It's a shame to mix sweet and savory
Oh no, I know it's a travesty

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, so low-class
Hello, hello, hello, it's a farce
Hello, hello, hello, so low-class
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less tasty
Here we are now, don't you defy us
I feel sick, it's so hasty
Here we are now, don't you deny us
A pineapple, a disgrace
A sacrilege, to pizza's grace

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, no, nay

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I adore
And for this curse, I feel poor
Our little group has always been
Against pineapple, forever clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, so low-class
Hello, hello, hello, it's a farce
Hello, hello, hello, so low-class
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less tasty
Here we are now, don't you defy us
I feel sick, it's so hasty
Here we are now, don't you deny us
A pineapple, a disgrace
A sacrilege, to pizza's grace

[Outro]
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial
A denial
