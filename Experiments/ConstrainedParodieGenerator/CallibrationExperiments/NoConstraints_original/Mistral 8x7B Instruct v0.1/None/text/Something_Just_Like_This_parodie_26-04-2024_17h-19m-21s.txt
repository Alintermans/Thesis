[Verse 1: Parody Chris]
I've been reading food debates, so old
The warnings and the facts
About pineapple, I've been told
It doesn't belong on pizza, that's a fact
Hawaiian's bold, but it's a bad act

[Pre-Chorus: Parody Chris]
But they said, "Where d'you wanna go?
What kind of pizza d'you pick?"
I'm not looking for a slice
With pineapple on it, that's a brick

[Chorus: Parody Chris]
I want something just like this
I want no pineapple on my dish
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

[Verse 2: Parody Chris]
I've been reading food debates, so old
The warnings and the facts
About pineapple, I've been told
It doesn't belong on pizza, that's a fact
Hawaiian's bold, but it's a bad act

[Pre-Chorus: Parody Chris]
They said, "Where d'you wanna go?
What kind of pizza d'you pick?"
I'm not looking for a slice
With pineapple on it, that's a brick

[Chorus: Parody Chris]
I want something just like this
I want no pineapple on my dish
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

[Bridge: Parody Chris]
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

[Pre-Chorus: Parody Chris]
Where d'you wanna go?
What kind of pizza d'you pick?
I'm not looking for a slice
With pineapple on it, that's a brick

[Chorus: Parody Chris]
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want no pineapple on my dish
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want no pineapple on my dish
Oh, I want something just like this.
