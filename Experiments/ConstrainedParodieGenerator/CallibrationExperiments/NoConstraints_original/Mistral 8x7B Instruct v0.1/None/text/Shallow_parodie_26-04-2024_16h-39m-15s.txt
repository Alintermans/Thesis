[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me something, friend
Do you think pineapple on pizza should end?
Or do you need more?
Is there not something better in store?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm appalled
In all the good meals, I find myself enthralled
By change
And, in the bad dishes, I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, mate
Aren't you tired of the sweet and the weight?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it sickly keeping that core?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm appalled
In all the good meals, I find myself enthralled
By change
And, in the bad dishes, I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the crust
Crash through the toppings where they can't hurt us
We're far from the pineapple now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, pineapple
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, pineapple
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh-ah, ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the crust
Crash through the toppings where they can't hurt us
We're far from the pineapple now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, pineapple
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, pineapple
We're far from the shallow now.
