[Intro]
Come on, crowd, we wanna share our view

[Verse 1]
Holdin' me down
Pineapple's weighing pizza town
I want you to take a good hard look
Why don't we give it the boot, oh-oh-oh
Nothin' to gain
When taste buds start to complain
Sweet and savory's such a pain
And I'm the one who will abstain, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this dish, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this dish, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
Answer the call
"Pineapple, you're no good at all
Why are you ruining pizza night?
What kind of topping are you, right?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to the rescue
It's time to face the music
Pineapple's got to go, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this dish, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this dish, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Bridge]
Stay away, don't you dare defile
I don't wanna talk about the way it was
Leave the pineapple on the grocery aisle
I don't wanna talk about who's ruining the style

[Outro]
(Hey)
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
