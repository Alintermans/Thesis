[Verse 1]
Now I've heard of a dish that's quite absurd
A pineapple on a pizza, it just doesn't concur
But you don't really care for my thoughts, do ya?
It goes like this, the dough, the sauce
The cheese melted, it all goes awry
The baffled chef making this monstrosity

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)

[Verse 2]
Your taste was strong, but you needed proof
You tried it once and it was aloof
It tasted wrong, it overthrew ya
She served you some, you couldn't believe
Your taste buds cried, you couldn't conceive
The horror of pineapple on a pizza

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)

[Verse 3]
You say I took the taste in vain
I don't even care for the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya?
There's a blaze of disgust in every bite
It doesn't matter which you tried
The holy or the broken pizza with pineapple

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)

[Verse 4]
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't taste, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of taste
With nothing on my tongue but "no pineapple"

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)

[Outro]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah (no pineapple)

[Additional Lyrics]
Baby, I've been here before
I know this dish, I've walked this floor
I used to eat alone before I knew you
And I've seen your pineapple on the pizza arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah (no pineapple)

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy taste was moving too
And every bite we drew was Hallelujah (no pineapple)

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah (no pineapple)
