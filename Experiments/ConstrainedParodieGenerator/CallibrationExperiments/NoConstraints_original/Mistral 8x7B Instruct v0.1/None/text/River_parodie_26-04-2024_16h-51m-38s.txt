[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, been a fool
Been a hater, been a tool
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Parody]
He's comin' home with pineapple on his plate
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, can't believe his fate
On his pizza's crust, it shouldn't be there, it's a fact
She just wants to scrape it off, can't take that act
It's a mess, she's on his case, like a pest attack
She's kept track of all the toppings that he lacks
And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next
Actually, just scrape that pineapple, it's for the best

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker, been a fool
Been a hater, been a tool
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Parody]
A slice of pineapple turned a dinner date
It was "come sunshine, scrape," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels betrayed, used
'Cause he still eats pineapple, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and you
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'Cause now with pineapple in the womb
We can't bring it in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Parody]
I've been a joker, been a fool
Been a hater, been a tool
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (
I'm sorry
)
I don't want to admit to something (
I fucked up
)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Parody & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)
Pineapple 
(Ooh)
, river run
Call me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)
Pineapple (Ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Parody]
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If pizza was a highway
And pineapple was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Parody]
I've been a joker, been a fool
Been a hater, been a tool
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (
I'm sorry
)
I don't want to admit to something (
I fucked up
)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
