[Verse 1]
First things first
I'll state my case, it's plain to see
Pineapple's got no place
On a pizza, can't you agree, oh-ooh
On a pizza, can't you agree, oh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Second things second
Don't you dare tell me it's a delicacy
I'm the one who's had a slice
And knows it's just a travesty, oh-ooh
Just a travesty, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been tasting, I've been trying
To enjoy it, but just can't abide it
Writing this plea for the few
That share my view, took to me, shook their heads, denying
Singing my stance from the soul
Taking my resolve to the goal
Speaking my mind from the scroll
Seeing the error in the...

[Chorus]
Pineapple! You made me a, you made me a
Disbeliever, disbeliever
Pineapple! You ruin the taste, you spoil the feast
Disbeliever, disbeliever
Pineapple! Oh, let the disgust grow, oh, let it rain
My taste buds, my joy, my craving, it drained from...
Pineapple! You made me a, you made me a
Disbeliever, disbeliever

[Verse 3]
Third things third
Send a plea to the chefs and the cooks
All the fans that you've misled
Have turned their stomachs to a rook, oh-ooh
Their stomachs to a rook, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was gagging in the crowd
Building my hate up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my taste buds, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

[Chorus]
Pineapple! You made me a, you made me a
Disbeliever, disbeliever
Pineapple! You ruin the taste, you spoil the feast
Disbeliever, disbeliever
Pineapple! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My taste buds, my joy, my craving, it drained from…
Pineapple! You made me a, you made me a
Disbeliever, disbeliever

[Verse 4]
Last things last
By the grace of the taste and the zest
You're the bane of the feast
The rot in my veins, oh-ooh
The rot in my veins, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

[Chorus]
Pineapple! You made me a, you made me a
Disbeliever, disbeliever
Pineapple! You ruin the taste, you spoil the feast
Disbeliever, disbeliever
Pineapple! Oh, let the disgust grow, oh, let it rain
My taste buds, my joy, my craving, it drained from…
Pineapple! You made me a, you made me a
Disbeliever, disbeliever
