[Verse]
Emerging from my den, with pineapple on my mind
Should I, should I dare, this topping I deride
It started with a slice, how did it end up so vile?
(It was just a fruit) It was just a trial
Now I'm pushing away, with a grimace and a sigh
While they're praising the taste, and asking for a slice
Now they're digging in deep, and my stomach's in a twist
And it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
But they're loving the taste now
It's on their plates now
Let me go
'Cause I just can't bear, it's drivin' me insane
And ruining the taste

[Chorus]
Jealousy, turning foodies to the fray
Swimming through sickening lies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Pineapple-Free

[Guitar Solo]

I never
