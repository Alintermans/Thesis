Why pineapple should not be on a pizza
(Verse 1)
First things first, let's get it straight
Pineapple has no place on a pizza, it's a fact
It's like putting ketchup on a steak
Or peanut butter on a slice of cake
It just don't make no sense, it's a crime
Against the pizza gods, it's a sin
(Chorus)
Pineapple, pineapple, don't you see
It don't belong on a pizza, it's just not me
Pineapple, pineapple, please hear my plea
Leave the pizza alone, it's just not meant to be
(Verse 2)
Second things second, let's get real
Pineapple's sweetness don't mesh with the deal
It's like putting honey on a hot dog
Or ice cream on a burger, it just don't go
It's a flavor clash, it's a disgrace
To the pizza gods, it's a waste
(Chorus)
Pineapple, pineapple, don't you see
It don't belong on a pizza, it's just not me
Pineapple, pineapple, please hear my plea
Leave the pizza alone, it's just not meant to be
(Verse 3)
Third things third, let's make it clear
Pineapple's a fruit, but it don't belong here
On a pizza, it's like putting jelly on a spoon
Or peanut butter on a shoe, it just don't make no sense, boo
It's a pizza faux pas, it's a crime
Against the pizza gods, it's a rhyme
(Chorus)
Pineapple, pineapple, don't you see
It don't belong on a pizza, it's just not me
Pineapple, pineapple, please hear my plea
Leave the pizza alone, it's just not meant to be
(Verse 4)
Last things last, let's make it clear
Pineapple's a fruit, but it don't belong here
On a pizza, it's like putting ketchup on a steak
Or peanut butter on a slice of cake, it just don't make no sense, it's a bake
It's a pizza sin, it's a crime
Against the pizza gods, it's a rhyme
(Chorus)
Pineapple, pineapple, don't you see
It don't belong on a pizza, it's just not me
Pineapple, pineapple, please hear my plea
Leave the pizza alone, it's just not meant to be.
