Why Pineapple Shouldn't Be on a Pizza
(Verse 1)
My toppings got taste
She's the disgust at the feast
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've thrown it away sooner
If the fridge ever did speak
It's the last true mouthpiece
Every meal's gettin' more bleak
A fresh disappointment each week
We were born picky, you heard them say it
My stomach offers no absolutes
It tells me, "Eat in moderation"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with my fork
I was born picky, but I love it
Command me to be healthy

(Pre-Chorus)
Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

(Chorus)
Take me to the dumpster
I'll eat like a dog at the trash can of your lies
I'll tell you my leftovers and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless disappointment
Oh, good God, let me give you my hunger
Take me to the dumpster
I'll eat like a dog at the trash can of your lies
I'll tell you my leftovers and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless disappointment
Oh, good God, let me give you my hunger

(Verse 2)
If I'm a picky of the good food
My toppings are the best
To keep the hunger at my side
It demands a salad
Drain the whole fridge, get somethin' fresh
Somethin' crunchy for the main course
That's a fine lookin' meal
What you got in the pantry?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

(Chorus)
Take me to the dumpster
I'll eat like a dog at the trash can of your lies
I'll tell you my leftovers and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless disappointment
Oh, good God, let me give you my hunger
Take me to the dumpster
I'll eat like a dog at the trash can of your lies
I'll tell you my leftovers and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless disappointment
Oh, good God, let me give you my hunger

(Bridge)
No leftovers or scraps when the meal begins
There is no sweeter satisfaction than our picky sin
In the fridge and cupboard of that sad modern scene
Only then, I am full, only then, I am clean

(Pre-Chorus)
Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

(Chorus)
Take me to the dumpster
I'll eat like a dog at the trash can of your lies
I'll tell you my leftovers and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless disappointment
Oh, good God, let me give you my hunger
Take me to the dumpster
I'll eat like a dog at the trash can of your lies
I'll tell you my leftovers and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless disappointment
Oh, good God, let me give you my hunger
