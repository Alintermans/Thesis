[Verse 1]
Just a pineapple, livin' on a pizza
In a world of cheese and sauce, it's such a pity
Just a fruit, born and raised in Hawaii
It's on a pizza, goin' anywhere

[Verse 2]
A topping in a heatwave
The smell of sweat and grease
For a bite, they can share the pie
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the crust
Their hunger searchin' in the night
Toppings, people
Livin' just to find a bite
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
Workin' hard to get a slice
Everybody wants a taste
Payin' anything to roll the dough
Just one more time

[Verse 4]
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to be toppings
Oh, the pizza never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the crust
Their hunger searchin' in the night
Toppings, people
Livin' just to find a bite
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Don't stop toppin'
Hold on to that cheese
Toppings, people
Don't stop toppin'
Hold on
Toppings, people
Don't stop toppin'
Hold on to that cheese

In this parody, I've tried to maintain the same syllable count and rhyme scheme as the original song, while also making it clear why pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza. I've used similar language and imagery to the original, but with a pineapple twist. I hope you enjoy it!
