[Intro]
(Pineapple? Pineapple? Pineapple? Pineapple?)

[Verse 1]
Once I bit into a slice (Uh-huh)
With the juice drippin' down my chin (Uh-huh)
I couldn't help but think (Uh-huh)
Why pineapple shouldn't be on a pizza (Uh-huh)
Red sauce, mozzarella too (Uh-huh)
But pineapple? No, no, no (Uh-huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later (Oh)
I still can't believe you put pineapple on (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every topping's bed for somethin' greater, baby (Oh, Lord)

[Chorus]
Was it over when you added pineapple to the mix? (Uh-huh)
Was it over when you thought it was a good idea? (Uh-huh)
"Come here," I whispered in your ear (Uh-huh)
In your dream as you passed out, baby (Uh-huh)
Was it over then? And is it over now? (Uh-huh)

[Verse 2]
Wh–µn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Pineapple on the rise (Uh-huh)
I couldn't help but think (Uh-huh)
Why pineapple shouldn't be on a pizza (Uh-huh)
Red sauce, mozzarella too (Uh-huh)
But pineapple? No, no, no (Uh-huh)

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you? (Uh-huh)
There were flashin' lights (Uh-huh)
At least I had the decency (Uh-huh)
To keep my nights out of sight (Uh-huh)
Only rumors 'bout my toppings and crust (Uh-huh)
And my whispered sighs (Uh-huh)
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin' (Uh-huh)
Off of very tall pizzas (Uh-huh)
Just to see you come runnin' (Uh-huh)
And say the one thing I've been wantin', but no (Uh-huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later (Oh)
I still can't believe you put pineapple on (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every topping's bed for somethin' greater, baby (Oh, Lord)

[Chorus]
Was it over when you added pineapple to the mix? (Uh-huh)
Was it over when you thought it was a good idea? (Uh-huh)
"Come here," I whispered in your ear (Uh-huh)
In your dream as you passed out, baby (Uh-huh)
Was it over then? And is it over now? (Uh-huh)

[Outro]
(Pineapple? Pineapple? Pineapple?)

Was it over when you added pineapple to the mix? (Uh-huh)
Was it over when you thought it was a good idea? (Uh-huh)

In your dream as you passed out, baby (Uh-huh)
Was it over then? And is it over now? (Uh-huh)
