Why Pineapple Should Not Be on a Pizza

[Intro]
Come on, pizza, we wanna say no to you

[Verse 1]
Sweet and tangy, but not for me
Pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza, you see
It's like putting ketchup on a steak
Or peanut butter on a pizza, it's just not right, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this topping world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this topping world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
Pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms too
But pineapple, oh no, that's not for me and you
It's like a flavor bomb, but not in a good way
Makes me wanna throw my pizza in dismay, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this topping world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this topping world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Bridge]
Classic, spicy, meat-lovers, veggie too
But pineapple, oh no, that's not for me and you
It's like a culinary crime, don't you see?
Leave it on the tree, where it belongs to me, oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
(Hey)
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

In this parody, I've tried to maintain the same syllable count and rhyme scheme as the original song, while also making it clear why pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza. I've used similar language and imagery to the original, but with a twist that fits the new topic.
