Comin' out of my pineapple and I'm doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be on the side 'cause it's not my crime
It started out with a slice, how did it end up like this?
(It was only a slice) It was only a slice
Now I'm fallin' asleep and my taste buds are awake
While he's havin' a snack and she's takin' a bite
Now they're goin' to the fridge and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
But she's toppings his pizza now
He takes off her toppings now
Let me go
'Cause I just can't look, it's killin' me
And takin' control

[Chorus]
Jealousy, turnin' toppings into the cheese
Swimmin' through sauce lullabies
Chokin' on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is callin' me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Pineapple

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never

In this parody, I've tried to maintain the same syllable count and rhyme scheme as the original song, while also making it clear why pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza. I've used similar language and imagery to the original, but with a pineapple twist. I hope you enjoy it!
