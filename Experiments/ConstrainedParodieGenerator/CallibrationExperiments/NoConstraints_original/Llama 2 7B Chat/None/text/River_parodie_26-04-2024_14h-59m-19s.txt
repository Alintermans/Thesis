Why pineapple should not be on a pizza

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his taste buds in shock, to catch flack
Sweat drippin' from his brow, he's cookin' on the back
He's got a hankerin' for some cheese, but pineapple's not the way
It's like puttin' ketchup on a burger, it just don't go
He's tried it before, but now he knows for sure
Pineapple don't belong on a pizza, it's just not the cure
For his pizza cravings, he needs somethin' real
Like pepperoni or sausage, somethin' that's feel
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pizza lover, been a cheat
Been a rebel, been a treat
All my toppings need pineapple, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A pineapple on a pizza, it's like a sin
It's like puttin' ketchup on a hot dog, it just don't fit in
He's tried it before, but now he knows for sure
Pineapple don't belong on a pizza, it's just not the cure
For his pizza cravings, he needs somethin' real
Like pepperoni or sausage, somethin' that's feel
He's comin' home with his taste buds in shock, to catch flack
Sweat drippin' from his brow, he's cookin' on the back
He's got a hankerin' for some cheese, but pineapple's not the way
It's like puttin' ketchup on a burger, it just don't go
He's tried it before, but now he knows for sure
Pineapple don't belong on a pizza, it's just not the cure
For his pizza cravings, he needs somethin' real
Like pepperoni or sausage, somethin' that's feel
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pizza lover, been a cheat
Been a rebel, been a treat
All my toppings need pineapple, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)
Pizza (Ooh), pizza run
(Ooh)
, pizza run
Call me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)
Pizza (Ooh), we'll let the pizza run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the pineapple, never the pie
Fuck can I say? If life was a pizza
And pineapple was the topping, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This pineapple pizza left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your cheese
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pizza lover, been a cheat
Been a rebel, been a treat
All my toppings need pineapple, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (
I'm sorry
)
I don't want to admit to something (
I fucked up
)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
