Why Pineapple Should Not Be on a Pizza
(Verse 1)
Now I've heard there was a topping craze
That pineapple brought to the pizza phase
But you don't really care for cheese, do ya?
It goes like this, the margherita, the pepperoni
The baffled pizza lover composing "No pineapple, please"

(Chorus)
No pineapple, no pineapple
No pineapple, no pineapple

(Verse 2)
Your taste buds were strong, but you needed proof
You saw the sauce and it overthrew ya
The cheese and the pepperoni, they broke your heart
And from your lips they drew the "No pineapple, please"

(Chorus)
No pineapple, no pineapple
No pineapple, no pineapple

(Verse 3)
You say I took the toppings in vain
I don't even know the flavor
But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya?
There's a flavor in every bite
It doesn't matter which you choose
The cheesy or the peppery "No pineapple, please"

(Chorus)
No pineapple, no pineapple
No pineapple, no pineapple

(Verse 4)
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't taste, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the pizza lover's throne
With nothing on my tongue but "No pineapple, please"

(Chorus)
No pineapple, no pineapple
No pineapple, no pineapple

[Outro]
No pineapple, no pineapple
No pineapple, no pineapple

Additional Lyrics:
Baby, I've been here before
I know this topping, I've walked this crust
I used to love pepperoni before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the pizza arch
Love is not a topping march
It's a cold and it's a broken "No pineapple, please"

Additional Lyrics:
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on in the toppings below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The cheesy dove was moving too
And every bite we drew was "No pineapple, please"

Additional Lyrics:
Maybe there's a topping above
But all I've ever learned from cheese
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken "No pineapple, please"
