Why Pineapple Shouldn't Be on a Pizza
(Verse 1)
In the land of toppings, there's one that's bold
A fruit that's sweet, but doesn't belong
On a pie that's savory, it's a crime
Pineapple, oh pineapple, why do you shine?
In the night, we'll wish this never ends
But pineapple on a pizza, it just doesn't mends

(Chorus)
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's not the same
The flavors just don't mix, it's such a shame
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's not the same
The toppings just don't match, it's such a shame

(Verse 2)
The cheese is melted, the sauce is rich
But pineapple, oh pineapple, it just doesn't click
With pepperoni and mushroom, it's a perfect blend
But pineapple, oh pineapple, it just doesn't mend

(Chorus)
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's not the same
The flavors just don't mix, it's such a shame
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's not the same
The toppings just don't match, it's such a shame

(Bridge)
In the world of toppings, there's room for all
But pineapple on a pizza, it just stands tall
As a fruit that's sweet, but doesn't belong
Pineapple, oh pineapple, why do you shine?

(Chorus)
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's not the same
The flavors just don't mix, it's such a shame
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's not the same
The toppings just don't match, it's such a shame

(Outro)
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
