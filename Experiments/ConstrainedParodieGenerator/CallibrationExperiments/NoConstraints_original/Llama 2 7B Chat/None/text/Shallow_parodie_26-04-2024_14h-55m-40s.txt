Why Pineapple Should Not Be on a Pizza

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Tell me somethin', boy
Isn't it clear that pineapple don't belong on a pie?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it obvious that it's just not right?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm cringin'
In all the good times, I find myself disgusted
By the thought of pineapple on a pizza

[Verse 2: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me something, girl
Don't you see that pineapple don't belong on a pie?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it plain that it's just not worth the try?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm cringin'
In all the good times, I find myself disgusted
By the thought of pineapple on a pizza

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
We're off the deep end, watch as we dive in
We'll never eat the pineapple again
Crash through the surface where it can't sting us
We're far from the pineapple now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh-ah, ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
We're off the deep end, watch as we dive in
We'll never eat the pineapple again
Crash through the surface where it can't sting us
We're far from the pineapple now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
We're far from the pineapple now
