[Intro]
I think I, I think I finally
Found a way to forgive myself
For the pizza crime I've committed in the past
I think that's the first step, right?
You agree?

[Verse]
I've ordered pizza with a topping, my dear
Can't pretend that it's the perfect pair
Oh, man, what a flavor, the things I hear
If I could act on my cravings, no, I wouldn't dare
Some like it hot, some like it sweet
But pineapple on pizza, that's just not right
It's a sin, it's a crime, it's a culinary feat
And you'd have thought that I would know better, wouldn't you?
I've ordered pizza with a topping, my dear
Can't pretend that it's the perfect pair
Oh, man, what a flavor, the things I hear
If I could act on my cravings, no, I wouldn't dare
Some like it hot, some like it sweet
But pineapple on pizza, that's just not right

[Chorus]
In my pizza, there's no pine
In my pizza, there's no pine
In my pizza, there's no pine-pine-pine
In my pizza, there's no pine
In my pizza, there's no pine-pine-pine
In my pizza, there's no pine

[Outro]
In my pizza, there's no pine
I'll never put pineapple on my pizza again
Is my taste your freedom?
Is all of my taste your freedom?
Enjoy
