[Verse 1]
My pizza's got a problem
It's the pineapple on top
It's the giggle at a dinner
I should've scrapped it in the trash
If the flavors ever did speak
Pineapple's the last thing I seek
Every bite's gettin' more bleak
A fresh disappointment each week
We were born to love pizza
But pineapple's a sin, you heard them say it
My taste buds offer no absolutes
She tells me, "Pineapple's a crime"
The only pizza I'll be eating
Is one without that nasty fruit
I was born to love pizza, but I hate it
Command me to try something new

[Pre-Chorus]
A, amen
Amen, amen

[Chorus]
Take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that perfect slice
Oh, good pizza, let me give you my life
Take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that perfect slice
Oh, good pizza, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good toppings
My pizza's the sunlight
To keep the flavors on my side
It demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sauce, get somethin' tasty
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' pepperoni
What you got in the kitchen?
We've a lot of starvin' taste buds
That looks delicious, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that perfect slice
Oh, good pizza, let me give you my life
Take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that perfect slice
Oh, good pizza, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the pizza's served
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle crave
In the madness and soil of that sad kitchen scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

[Chorus]
Take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that perfect slice
Oh, good pizza, let me give you my life
Take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your cheese
I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that perfect slice
Oh, good pizza, let me give you my life
