[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fool, been a clown
Been a pizza lover, never without a crown
All my toppings need a slice, feel it calling me
Well, little pizza, I don't want to admit to a crime
If all it's gonna cause is strife
The truth and my lies now are falling like the cheese
So let the pizza be

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a pizza lover, never without a belief
That pineapple doesn't belong on a pie
It's a sin, it's a crime, it's a pizza lie
I've been a cheat, been a fake
Been a pizza snob, never a pizza snake
I don't want to admit to a mistake
But pineapple on pizza, it's a pizza fake

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fool, been a clown
Been a pizza lover, never without a crown
All my toppings need a slice, feel it calling me
Well, little pizza, I don't want to admit to a crime
If all it's gonna cause is strife
The truth and my lies now are falling like the cheese
So let the pizza be

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I've been a fool, been a clown
Been a pizza lover, never without a frown
I don't want to admit to a mistake
But pineapple on pizza, it's a pizza fake
It's a crime, it's a sin, it's a pizza lie
I've been a cheat, been a fake
Been a pizza snob, never a pizza snake
I don't want to admit to a mistake
But pineapple on pizza, it's a pizza fake

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a fool, been a clown
Been a pizza lover, never without a crown
All my toppings need a slice, feel it calling me
Well, little pizza, I don't want to admit to a crime
If all it's gonna cause is strife
The truth and my lies now are falling like the cheese
So let the pizza be

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)
Pizza (Ooh), pizza run
Call me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)
Pizza (Ooh), we'll let the pizza run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the pizza lover, never "The pizza, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If pizza was a highway
And pineapple was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But pineapple on pizza, it's a pizza hate
This pizza triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our pizza child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a fool, been a clown
Been a pizza lover, never without a crown
All my toppings need a slice, feel it calling me
Well, little pizza, I don't want to admit to a crime
If all it's gonna cause is strife
The truth and my lies now are falling like the cheese
So let the pizza be
