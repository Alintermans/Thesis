[Chorus]
When pineapple's on a pizza, it's a crime
I'm happier without it, it's a fact, not a rhyme
Wish I could explain it better, but it's plain to see
Pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza, it's not meant to be

[Verse 1]
Give me a break from the toppings that you choose
I'll take a pass on the pine, it's not my muse
I'd rather have pepperoni, or maybe some mush
But pineapple on pizza, it's just not my rush
You can keep your Hawaiian pizza, it's not my scene
I'll stick to the classics, they're what I've been

[Chorus]
When pineapple's on a pizza, it's a crime
I'm happier without it, it's a fact, not a rhyme
Wish I could explain it better, but it's plain to see
Pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza, it's not meant to be

[Verse 2]
You can call me a purist, or maybe a snob
But pineapple on pizza, it's just not my job
I don't want it on my pie, it's not my desire
I'll take a plain cheese pizza, that's my only fire
I don't need the sweetness, it's not my vice
Give me a break from the pine, it's not my prize

[Chorus]
When pineapple's on a pizza, it's a crime
I'm happier without it, it's a fact, not a rhyme
Wish I could explain it better, but it's plain to see
Pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza, it's not meant to be

[Verse 3]
So don't try to convince me, it's not worth the fight
I'll stick to my beliefs, they're what feel right
Pineapple on pizza, it's just not my scene
I'll take a classic margherita, that's my dream
I don't need the drama, it's not my game
Give me a break from the pine, it's not my aim

[Outro]
Pineapple on pizza, it's just not my thing
I'll stick to the classics, they're my everything
So don't try to change my mind, it's not worth the try
Pineapple on pizza, it's just not my sky.
