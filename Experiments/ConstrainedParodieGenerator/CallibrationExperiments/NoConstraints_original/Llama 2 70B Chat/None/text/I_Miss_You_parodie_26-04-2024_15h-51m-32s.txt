[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I protest, I protest

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Pineapple on a pizza, oh what a sight
The toppings in the store, they just don't feel right
The sweetness of the fruit, it doesn't belong
It's like putting ketchup on a chocolate cake, it's just wrong

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza, I miss pizza
I miss pizza, I miss pizza

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and cheese
These are the toppings that bring me to my knees
But pineapple, it just doesn't fit the bill
It's like putting mayonnaise on a grilled cheese, it's just not right

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
The worst topping that I've ever seen (
I miss pizza, I miss pizza
)
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
The worst topping that I've ever seen (
I miss pizza, I miss pizza
)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
The worst topping that I've ever seen (
I miss pizza, I miss pizza
)
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
The worst topping that I've ever seen (
I miss pizza, I miss pizza
)
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
The worst topping that I've ever seen (
I miss pizza, I miss pizza
)
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
The worst topping that I've ever seen (
I miss pizza, I miss pizza
)

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pizza, I miss pizza
I miss pizza, I miss pizza
I miss pizza, I miss pizza
I miss pizza, I miss pizza
