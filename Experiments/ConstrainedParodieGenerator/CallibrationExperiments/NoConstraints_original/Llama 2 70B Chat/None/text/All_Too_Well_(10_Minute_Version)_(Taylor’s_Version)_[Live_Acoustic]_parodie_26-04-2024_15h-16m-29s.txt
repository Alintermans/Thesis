[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria, the aroma filled the air
But something 'bout the toppings, I just couldn't bear
The thought of pineapple on a pie, it just didn't feel right
I knew I had to speak up, and let my voice take flight

[Chorus]
Oh, pineapple on pizza, it's a crime
A culinary abomination, a flavor that's just not fine
It's a travesty, a catastrophe, a gastronomic sin
Pineapple on pizza, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
I know some people love it, they think it's a treat
But to me, it's a sacrilege, a culinary defeat
The sweetness of the pineapple, it just doesn't belong
It's like putting ketchup on a hot dog, it's just not right, it's wrong

[Chorus]
Oh, pineapple on pizza, it's a crime
A culinary abomination, a flavor that's just not fine
It's a travesty, a catastrophe, a gastronomic sin
Pineapple on pizza, no, no, no, no, no

[Bridge]
I know I'm not alone, there are others who agree
Pineapple on pizza, it's a no-go, it's just not me
We'll take our pies with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and cheese
But pineapple, no thanks, that's just not how we please

[Verse 3]
I'll take a slice of pepperoni, or a calzone too
But pineapple on pizza, that's just not what I do
It's a cultural phenomenon, a fad that's gone too far
Let's keep our pizzas classic, and leave the pineapple in the jar

[Chorus]
Oh, pineapple on pizza, it's a crime
A culinary abomination, a flavor that's just not fine
It's a travesty, a catastrophe, a gastronomic sin
Pineapple on pizza, no, no, no, no, no

[Outro]
So let's all agree, no pineapple on our pies
Let's keep our pizzas traditional, with flavors that never die
No pineapple on pizza, that's just the way it's gotta be
It's a culinary rule, that's just plain common decency.
