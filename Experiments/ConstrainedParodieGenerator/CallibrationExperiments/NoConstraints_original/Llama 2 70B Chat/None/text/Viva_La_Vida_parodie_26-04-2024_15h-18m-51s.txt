[Verse 1]
I used to love pizza, it was my heart's desire
But now it's just a memory, a distant fire
The toppings were my kingdom, I ruled with grace
But now it's all gone wrong, and I can't find my place

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
I used to think pineapple was the perfect topping
But now I see the error of my ways, it's just a flop
It's sweet and sour, it doesn't belong
It's like a fruit salad, it's just wrong

[Chorus]
I hear the pizza lovers singing
"Pineapple doesn't belong, it's just a crime"
Be my pizza, my sauce and cheese
My toppings in perfect harmony
For some reason, I can't explain
Pineapple just doesn't fit the bill

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It was a wicked and wild craze
Pineapple on pizza, what were we thinking?
It's a travesty, a culinary crime
People couldn't believe we'd stoop so low

[Chorus]
I hear the pizza lovers singing
"Pineapple doesn't belong, it's just a crime"
Be my pizza, my sauce and cheese
My toppings in perfect harmony
For some reason, I can't explain
Pineapple just doesn't fit the bill

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Hear the pizza lovers singing
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Pineapple doesn't belong, it's just a crime
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Be my pizza, my sauce and cheese
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
My toppings in perfect harmony
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
For some reason, I can't explain
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Pineapple just doesn't fit the bill

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm.
