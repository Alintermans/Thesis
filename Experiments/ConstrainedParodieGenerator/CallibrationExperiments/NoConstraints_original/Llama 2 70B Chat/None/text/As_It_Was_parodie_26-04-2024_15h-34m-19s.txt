[Intro]
Come on, pineapple, we wanna say goodbye to you

[Verse 1]
You're ruining the taste
Pizza's flavor is being abased
I want you to disappear from my sight
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to gain
When you're messin' with a classic dish
Seems you cannot be replaced
And pizza's the one that we'll always miss, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this world, it's just pizza
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just pizza
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
Answer the question
"Pineapple, you don't belong
Why are you on top of my pie?
What kind of flavor are you bringin'?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's comin' to save you
Pizza's reputation is on the line
Your taste is not worth the dime, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this world, it's just pizza
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just pizza
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Bridge]
Go away, get a new recipe
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave pizza alone, let it be
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

[Outro]
(Hey)
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
