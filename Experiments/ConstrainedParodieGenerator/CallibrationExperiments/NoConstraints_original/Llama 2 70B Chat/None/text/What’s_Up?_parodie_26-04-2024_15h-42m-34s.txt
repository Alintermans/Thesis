[Verse 1]
25 slices of pizza, and my stomach's still growling
Trying to figure out, why this topping's not belonging
Pineapple on pizza, it's a crime
It's like putting ketchup on a hot dog, it's just not fine

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I cry sometimes when I'm eating out
Just to get it all out, what's in my mouth
And I, I am feeling a little strange
And so I look around and I see the same
People eating pineapple pizza, it's such a shame

[Chorus]
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Pineapple on pizza, it's a crime)
Hey-ey-ey
(It's like putting ketchup on a hot dog)
(It's just not fine)
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Pineapple on pizza, it's a crime)
Hey-ey-ey
(It's like putting ketchup on a hot dog)
(It's just not fine)
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh

[Verse 2]
And I try, oh my God, do I try
I try all the time, to avoid that pizza pie
With pineapple on top, it's a sin
It's like putting ranch on a pizza, it's just not right

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I cry sometimes when I'm eating out
Just to get it all out, what's in my mouth
And I, I am feeling a little strange
And so I look around and I see the same
People eating pineapple pizza, it's such a shame

[Chorus]
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Pineapple on pizza, it's a crime)
Hey-ey-ey
(It's like putting ketchup on a hot dog)
(It's just not fine)
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Pineapple on pizza, it's a crime)
Hey-ey-ey
(It's like putting ketchup on a hot dog)
(It's just not fine)
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh

[Outro]
25 slices of pizza, and my stomach's still growling
Trying to figure out, why this topping's not belonging
Pineapple on pizza, it's a crime
It's like putting ketchup on a hot dog, it's just not fine.
