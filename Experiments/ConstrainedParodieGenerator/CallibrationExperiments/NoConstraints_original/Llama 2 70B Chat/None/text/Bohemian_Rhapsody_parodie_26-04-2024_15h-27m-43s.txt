[Intro]
Is this the real pizza? Is this just a dream?
Caught in a topping, no escape from the cheese
Open your eyes, look up to the pie and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little slice, little whole
Any way the toppings blow doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Papa, just added a topping
Put it on my pizza, took a bite, now it's gone
Papa, life had just begun
But now I've gone and ruined it all
Papa, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my pizza's done
Sends shivers down my spine, stomach's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Papa, ooh (Any way the toppings blow)
I don't wanna eat
I sometimes wish I'd never ordered at all
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a pineapple
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a pineapple put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can top me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
[Outro]
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the toppings blow.
