[Verse 1]
Have you got pineapple on your pizza?
Do you ever get that feeling it just don't fit?
It's like a crime, a culinary sin
Doesn't belong on a pie, it's just not right
Are there some flavors that you just can't mix?
Have you no taste, or are you just blind?
I've dreamt about pizza, but never with pine
How many toppings can you mess up, it's just not fine

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this topping's a no-go?
(Sad to see it go) Was sorta hopin' it would stay
(Baby, we both know) That pineapple's not the way
To make a pizza taste great, it's just not the day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to the menu
Ever thought of orderin' something new?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Picky about my toppings
To settle for somethin' new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to the menu

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts to try
A pizza without pineapple in the sky?
Been wonderin' if your taste buds are still alive
And if so, I wanna know what time they come alive
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to taste
A pizza that's perfect, not one that's a waste
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together, pineapple-free, that's true

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this topping's a no-go?
(Sad to see it go) Was sorta hopin' it would stay
(Baby, we both know) That pineapple's not the way
To make a pizza taste great, it's just not the day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to the menu
Ever thought of orderin' something new?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Picky about my toppings
To settle for somethin' new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to the menu

[Outro]
(Do I wanna know?) If this topping's a no-go?
(Sad to see it go) Was sorta hopin' it would stay
(Baby, we both know) That pineapple's not the way
To make a pizza taste great, it's just not the day
(Do I wanna know?) Too picky to try somethin' new?
(Sad to see it go) Ever thought of orderin' differently?
(Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to the menu?
