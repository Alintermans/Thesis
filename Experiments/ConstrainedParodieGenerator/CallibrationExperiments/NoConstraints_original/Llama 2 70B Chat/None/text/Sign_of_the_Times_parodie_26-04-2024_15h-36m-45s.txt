[Verse 1]
Just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times
Pineapple on pizza, it's a crime
It's a travesty, a culinary crime
Don't you know that it's just not right?
You can't pair sweet with savory
It's a flavor combination that's just not bright

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before
Why do we keep making the same mistakes?
The pineapple, the pineapple?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why do we keep making the same mistakes?
The pineapple, the pineapple?

[Chorus]
Just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times
Pineapple on pizza, it's a crime
We gotta get away from this trend
It's time to end this culinary offense
Just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times
Pineapple on pizza, it's a crime

[Verse 2]
Just stop your crying, have some self-control
Pineapple doesn't belong on a roll
It's a abomination, a culinary sin
Don't you know that it's just not right?
You can't pair sweet with savory
It's a flavor combination that's just not bright

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before
Why do we keep making the same mistakes?
The pineapple, the pineapple?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why do we keep making the same mistakes?
The pineapple, the pineapple?

[Chorus]
Just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times
Pineapple on pizza, it's a crime
We gotta get away from this trend
It's time to end this culinary offense
Just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times
Pineapple on pizza, it's a crime

[Bridge]
We don't taste enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know

[Outro]
Stop your whining, baby, it's a sign of the times
Pineapple on pizza, it's a crime
We gotta get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
