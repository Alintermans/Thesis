[Verse 1]
Load up on toppings, bring your friends
It's fun to choose and to pretend
Pineapple's not the way to go
Oh no, I know it's a no-go

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how strange
Hello, hello, hello, how strange
Hello, hello, hello, how strange
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With pizza, it's less delicious
Here we are now, disgust us
I feel sick and contagious
Here we are now, disgust us
A pineapple, a pizza killer
A mistake, a culinary crime

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yay

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at pizza toppings
And for this, I feel ashamed
Our pizza group has always been
And always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how strange
Hello, hello, hello, how strange
Hello, hello, hello, how strange
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With pizza, it's less delicious
Here we are now, disgust us
I feel sick and contagious
Here we are now, disgust us
A pineapple, a pizza killer
A mistake, a culinary crime

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yay

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it's not worth the waste
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, never mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how strange
Hello, hello, hello, how strange
Hello, hello, hello, how strange
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With pizza, it's less delicious
Here we are now, disgust us
I feel sick and contagious
Here we are now, disgust us
A pineapple, a pizza killer
A mistake, a culinary crime

[Outro]
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial
A denial, a denial
A denial
