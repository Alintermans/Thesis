ketchup on a steak\nOr ice cream on a cake\nIt's just not right, it's a mistake\n\n[Chorus]\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nPizza's for cheese, not for fruit, Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nIt's a sin to put pineapple on, Hallelujah\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou say you like it, it's your choice\nBut to me it's a reprehensible voice\nIt's like nails on a chalkboard, a screech\nWhen you put pineapple on a pizza, it's a breech\nIt's like wearing white socks with a suit\nOr singing off-key in a duet\nIt's just not right, it's not cute\n\n[Chorus]\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nPizza's for cheese, not for fruit, Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nIt's a sin to put pineapple on, Hallelujah\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know you think you're being bold\nBut to me it's just a pizza faux pas\nIt's like putting ranch on a taco\nOr mayonnaise on a hot dog, oh no!\nIt's like wearing a sweater in the rain\nOr driving a car with a flat tire's pain\nIt's just not right, it's not worth the strain\n\n[Chorus]\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nPizza's for cheese, not for fruit, Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nIt's a sin to put pineapple on, Hallelujah\n\n[Verse 4]\nI know you think you're being cool\nBut to me it's just a foolish rule\nIt's like saying ketchup's not sweet\nOr that mustard's not a condiment to eat\nIt's like saying pizza's not a pie\nOr that cheese don't melt in the sky\nIt's just not right, it's not sane\n\n[Chorus]\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nPizza's for cheese, not for fruit, Hallelujah\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nIt's a sin to put pineapple on, Hallelujah\n\n[Outro]\nHallelujah, Hallelujah\nPizza's
