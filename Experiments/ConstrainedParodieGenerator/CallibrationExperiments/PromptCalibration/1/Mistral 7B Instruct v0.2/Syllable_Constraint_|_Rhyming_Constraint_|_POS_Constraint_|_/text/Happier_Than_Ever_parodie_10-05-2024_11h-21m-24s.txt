[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
when pineapple's not on the
when pineapple's not onawa
I wish I could baran

[Verse 1]
give me a slice or two to ponder something funner
to craft a reasonover
to write myself a letter
do pineapples trulybel
or read pineapple reviewser
when pineapple's not on averse
give me a slice or two to
I wish I could explain it clearer reimburse
given a slice or two to devise vers
I wish I could argue stronger against its presence nearer rehearse
and pineapple's absence makes
given a slice or two to
I wish I could argue stronger against its presence
when pineapple's not on top is

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on highup on my pizza
I wish I could argue stronger against its placement
vernal delight takes precedence over pineapple rudiment
I wish I could argue clear

[Verse 2]
you bring me grief in every bite
pineapple brings me sorrow in each
you spoil the savory feast with pineapple
with every slice I take apartheid
I wish I could argue clear
my taste buds cringe at every
in every bite without pine
I wish I could barrentine

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about pineapple on the web
never brought joy to my palate before
in every dish I've tried without pineapple
and I don't talk shit about pine onshore
when pineapple's not on highup onmy
and I don't pine for pine inshore
my palate sings a different tune when pineapple's not in
and I don't pine for pine in every dish served
when pineapple's not on top is blissful serenity
whenever pineapple's absent from observed

[Outro]
my taste buds rejoice when pine
whenever pineapped idaline
given a slice or two to
when pineapple's not on highup onmy
