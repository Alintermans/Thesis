[Verse 1]
slice up a pineapple won
it's not fun with pineapple on
with the lights out on baking sheet brightened
slice up a pineapple sadness

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pineappleparody
hello pineappleparody
hydrophobe's fear renegade
with pineapple remade

[Chorus]
with the lights out it's less delicious
with the lights out it's avarice
with the lights out it's aqueous
when you order a pizza thus
this fruit on top does not belong
this tropical intr hopalong

[Post-Chorus]
with the lights

[Verse 2]
I despise the pineapple
I despise the pineal
I despise the pineapple's taste bud
but pineapple ruins the blend

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pineappleparody
hello pineappleparody
hydrophobe's fear renegade
with pineapple remade

[Chorus]
with the lights out it's less delicious
with the lights out it's avarice
with the lights out it's aqueous
when you order a pizza thus
this fruit on top does not belong
this tropical intr hopalong

[Post-Chorus]
with the lights

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I pine
oh pineapple on pizza so
I resist the pineapple's all
oh pineapple on gasohol

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pineappleparody
hello pineappleparody
hydrophobe's fear renegade
with pineapple remade

[Chorus]
with the lights out it's less delicious
with the lights out it's avarice
with the lights out it's aqueous
when you order a pizza thus
this fruit on top does not belong
this tropical intr hopalong

[Outro]
a paradox in pineapple
an anomaly arousal
the pineapple's unwinnable
this fruity addition austell
with pineal
