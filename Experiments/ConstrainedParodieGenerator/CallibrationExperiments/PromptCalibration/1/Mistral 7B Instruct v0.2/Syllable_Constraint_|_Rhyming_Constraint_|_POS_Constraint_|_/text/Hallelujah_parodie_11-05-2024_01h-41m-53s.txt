[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret fruit
now I've heard there was a secret fruit
now I've heard there was a secret fruit rejected
now I've heard there was a shameful
now I've heard there was a secret
now I've heard there was a fruit debate raging

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pineapples
hallelujah for mislabels

[Verse 2]
your taste was strong but you needed proof
your taste was strong but waterproof
your pizza's beauty in the oven light struck
your pizza's beauty in the cheese
your pizza'sat home with achilles
or your pizza's toppings changed the recipe

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pineapples
hallelujah for mislabels

[Verse 3]
you say I took a bite in vain
you say I added pineapple
but if I didadd pineapple to the pie
this fruit on top is not divineright
your pizza's faith was strong befit
a pineapple on pizza's blight reigns supreme

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pineapples
hallelujah for mislabels

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't sweet
I did my best it wasn't complete
I've tasted many pizzas madebefore
but if I did add pineapple
I did my best it tattersall
for pizza's sake reconsideratethis

[Chorus]

hypotheses sw switzerland
verse cautionary tale spiceland

vermin love pineapple inland
verse argumentative polland
verse introduction reprimand
vertex ive heard there sutherland
