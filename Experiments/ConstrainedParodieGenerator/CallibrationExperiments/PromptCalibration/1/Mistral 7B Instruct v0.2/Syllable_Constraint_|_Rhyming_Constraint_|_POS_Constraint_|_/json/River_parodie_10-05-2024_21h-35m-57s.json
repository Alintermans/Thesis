He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\nAlready generated parody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar saying pine\nI've been a liar saying\nI've been a liar saying pineapple's fine on pizza pie\nfirst I've been a liar saying pineapple's not a crime\nin the kitchen creating a\nI've been a liar saying pine's austria\nfirst I've been a liar\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's orderin' up a pizza with a twist\nhe's orderin' up a pizza\nhe's orderin' up a pineapple\nhe's orderin' up a pizza with a fias midst\nhe's orderin' up a pizza with a flutist\nhe's orderin' up a pizza with a\nhe's orderin' up a pizza with a debate inside\nfirst I've been a liar saying pineapple's not a crime on top first\nin the kitchen creating\nhe's ordering up a pizza with a twist of dismay\nhe's ordering up a pizza with remorse missed\nversion of pineapple on the pizza parody ver\nin the kitchen creating a\nhealing wound of disapproval caused by pineapple\nbut I've been a liar saying pineapple's not a sin on pie\nversion of pineapple on theatrical\nin the kitchen creating a debate\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar defending\nI've been a liar saying\nI've been a liar promoting this trending pineapple on\nfirst I've been a liar defending pineapple's place on\nin the kitchen creating a\nI've been a liar promoting aventura\nfirst I've been a liar\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na pineapple on pizza's an error\nhe's ordering up a pizza with a mistake\nhe's orderin' up a pizza heated with\nin the kitchen creating a debate we\nfirst I've been a liar defending theology\nhe's orderin' up a pizza with austerity\nhealing wound of controversy caused by pineapple's place\nhealing wound of tradition disrupted by pineapple's grace oncale\nfirst I've been a liar defending pineapple's oddity on top\nhealing wound of tradition interlace\nI've been a liar propagating a myth so grand\nvernal pineapple on pizza's blunder he' seasonally\nI've been a liar promoting auberry\nverse second for the pineapple onley\nvere be a liar defending the\nhealing wound of tradition disrupted by pine\nverse two line for the pineapple on par\nfirst I've been a liar\nI've been a liar defending aplenty\nI've been a liar saying pineapple's a mistake on pie\nver\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar den\nverse three\nden\nvertex three\nverified weathermen\nwhen people ask why itty bitty\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nin the kitchen creating a debate\nhes ordering up a pizza misstate\nhe's ordering up a pizza with a debate inside\nhe's ordering up a pizza with a tropical\nevery time I order up a pie\nI've been a liar saying\nI've been a liar promoting aural\nevery time I order up a pie with pine\nhe's ordering up a pizza with a pine\nheating up a dispute byzantine\nhe's ordering up a pizza with a pine\nhe's ordering up a pizza with a fruit\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar defending\nin the kitchen creating\nI've been a liar promoting a pineapple's fine on pie\nfirst I'vebean\nverify\n\nI've been a liar defending pine's\nI've been a\n\nin the kitchen creating a\nevery time I order up alyeska\n [/INST]\nSure here it is:\n",
