He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\nAlready generated parody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a hater saying pine\nin the culinary scene\na topping choice that's such a crime acedia in the cuisine\nback in the kitchen trying to intervene to stop this\nin the pizza game it's such a\npineapple on pizza's such a sinfonia\nback in the oven tried\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\na slice he's taking with a frown upon his\npizza police are on the scene\na bite he's taking with a grimace\na slice he's taking with a scowl upon hiss's\na slice he's taking with a groan and grimaces\na slice he's taking with a frown upon\na bite he's taking with a grimace and a frown upon\na slice he's taking with a groan and disapproval shown upon his\nin the pizzeria they\na slice he's taking with a groan and disapproval shown\na slice he's taking with a sigh and disposes\na slice he's taking with a sigh and then deposes it\nin the pizzeria they served\na slice he's taking with a sigh and then deposes\na slice he's taking with a sigh and then defrosts it from the free\na slice he's taking with a sigh professes\na slice he's taking with a sigh then says\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a hater saying pine\nin the pizzeria they\na slice he's taking with a sigh then says with every bite\na slice he's taking with a sigh then says with every\na slice he's taking with a sigh\na slice he's taking with a sigh then yuppify\na slice he's taking with\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na slice he's taking with a sigh then arg\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues with\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues pursues\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues canoes\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues should be banned\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues is a crying shame peruse\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues is a blunder in cu\na slice he's taking with a sigh degrand\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues is a\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues is rodrigeuz\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues\na slice he'staking with a disabuse\na slice he's taking with a sigh sous\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues is\na slice he's taking with a sigh then arg\na slice he's taking with\na slice he's taking with a sigh continues\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues is a culprit\na\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\na slice he's taking with\na slice\nwith\na slice he\na slice he's taking with\na slice he's taking with achingly\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\na slice he's taking with a sigh then arg\na slice he's taking with a sigh then arg\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues is a shame\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues is a\na slice he's taking with a sigh then arg\na slice he's taking with a\na slice he's taking with alysia\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues is\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues\na slice he's taking with disabuse\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a fool ordering pine\nin the pizzeria they\na slice he's taking with a sigh then argues is a baseless\na slice he's\u53d6with\navarice\n\nI've been a hater saying pineapple\na slice he\n\nin the pizzeria they serve\na slice he's taking with a sigh then arg oeuvre\n [/INST]\nSure here it is:\n",
