her sooner\nIf the heavens ever did speak\nShe's the last true mouthpiece\nEvery Sunday's gettin' more bleak\nA fresh poison each week\nWe were born sick, you heard them say it\nMy church offers no absolutes\nShe tells me, \"Worship in the bedroom\"\nThe only heaven I'll be sent to\nIs when I'm alone with you\nI was born sick, but I love it\nCommand me to be well\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nA, amen\nAmen, amen\n\n[Chorus]\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nOh, good God, let me give you my life\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nOh, good God, let me give you my life\n[Verse 2]\nIf I'm a pagan of the good times\nMy lover's the sunlight\nTo keep the goddess on my side\nShe demands a sacrifice\nDrain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny\nSomethin' meaty for the main course\nThat's a fine lookin' high horse\nWhat you got in the stable?\nWe've a lot of starvin' faithful\nThat looks tasty, that looks plenty\nThis is hungry work\n\n[Chorus]\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me my deathless death\nOh, good God, let me give you my life\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me my deathless death\nOh, good God, let me give you my life\n\n[Bridge]\nNo masters or kings when the ritual begins\nThere is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin\nIn the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene\nOnly then, I am human, only then, I am clean\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, oh, amen\nAmen, amen\n\n[Chorus]\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nOh, good God, let me give you my life\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that deathless death\nOh, good God, let me give you my life\n\n[Produced by Hozier and Rob Kirwan]\n\n[Video directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson]\nAlready generated parody:\n[Verse 1]\nwhy
