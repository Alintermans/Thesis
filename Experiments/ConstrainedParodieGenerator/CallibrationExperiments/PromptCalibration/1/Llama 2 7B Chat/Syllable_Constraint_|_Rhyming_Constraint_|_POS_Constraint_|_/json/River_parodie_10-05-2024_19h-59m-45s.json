He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\nAlready generated parody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nwhy pineapple should not be on\npineapple on a pizza\na pineapple on a pizza is like a lie on a res\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza is like a\npineapple on a pizza is\npineapple on a pizza is like alex's\nwhy pineapple should not\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe said pineapple on a pizza is like\nhe said pineapple on a pie\nin the land of toppings so divine\npineapple on a pizza should not ehrenreich\nwhy pineapple should not be on a p beaklike\npineapple on a pizza is like a\npineapple on a pizza is like a lie on a res\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza is like a lie on a\npineapple on a pizza\npineapple on a pizza is like a pineapple on\npineapple on a pizza is like a toothlike\npineapple on a pizza is like a pineapple on\npineapple on a pizza is\npineapple on a pizza is like a pineapple\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza is like a lie on\nwrite a parody about why pineal\npineapple on a pizza is like a\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\npineapple on a pizza is\npineapple on a pizza\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza is like a to\npineapple on a pizza is like a lie on a res\nin the land of pizza toppings\nwhy pineapple should not be on a p pennings\nwhy pineapple should not\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\npineapple on a pizza is like a\npineapple on a pizza is like a lie on\npineapple on a pizza is like a to\npineapple on my pizza is like a lie\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza isty\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza iwai\npineapple on a pizza is like a lie on a res\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza is like a lie on retry\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza is like a lie on res\nwhy pineapple should not be n aways\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza is like\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza is uruguay\nwhy pineapple should not be on a whereby\nwhy pineapple should not be on aka\nwhy pineapple should not be on buy\nwrite a parody about why pineapple should\npineapple on a pizza is like a\nwhy pineapple should not\npineapple on a pizza is like defy\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza is like a lie\npar\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\npineapple on a pe\npineale\npine\npineapple\npinealed itami\npineapple on a pumpernickel\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\npineapple on a pizza is like a\npineapple on a pizza isola\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza is like a\nparody about why pineapple should not be on\npineapple on a pizza is like a\nwhy pineapple should not be\nwhy pineapple should not be on aegon\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza is\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza\npineapple on a pizzitola\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\npineapple on a pizza is\npineapple on a pizza\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza is like a lie\nwhy pineapple\nwhy isty\n\npineapple on a pizza is like a\npizza should\n\npineapple on a pizza is\nwhy pineapple should not be on a pizza is [/INST]\nSure here it is:\n",
