[Intro]
okay with pizza we wanna say goodbye to

[Verse 1]
holdin' back the
pineapple on pizzuti
it's my turn now to write a verse for the par
why do people think that pineapp
pineapple up
why do people think that pileup
on pizza is a good thing
but pineapples do not belong above

[Chorus]
in this pizzeria
it's not a fruit that I would choose to
on a pizzitola
it is not the same asahara
on a ponderosa
it belongs in a smooth

[Verse 2]
holdin' onto
answer the phone itochu
here is the next line of the parody
we don't want pineapple
ringin' the bell
on pizza there's nothing to sell
we don't want pineapple
they're sitting at home on the floor too many

[Chorus]
in this pizzeria
it's not a fruit that I would choose to
on a pizzitola
it is not the same asahara
on a ponderosa
it belongs in a smooth

[Bridge]
ringin' the bell there's nobody coming
it sounds like you're writing a parody song about
ringin' the bell there's nobody coming
it sounds like you're writing a parody song about

[Outro]
ver
on pizza
it is not the same asahara
on a ponderosa
