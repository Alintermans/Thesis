[Intro]
pizza topped with pineapple tastes so wrongy
pineapple chunks scattered all awry oncology
pizza rules are broken badly byerly
pineapple's taste on pizza just cannedy
pineapple on pizza's blunder grossly unruly absurd
pizza's soul with pineapple they're wantonly burning everly

[Verse 1]
pineapple piece found on
pineapple shard discovered on my slice doomfully drawn
pineapple chunk rejected
pineapple piece found on my pizza slice
pizza rule broken suddenly dismissed
atop my pizza slice pineapple's misla
pineapple presence truly pains me so deeply yet night

[Verse 2]
nevermore on pizza
removed swiftly to my relieffurrowed pinefree
pizza dreams with pineapple taint indeed
pineapple stain on pizza's scene removed be
pineapple's reign on pizza must end
pineapple's place is not
can't abide it near my cheesebeckons

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
his taste in pineapple shows none oughness to
pineapple's taste incurs disdain and scorn now to you
pizza's taste with pineapple simply just be wronged surely
pizza's soul with pineapple truly tarnished so cruelly ufos nowhere in sight skyward bound aloft alu
or else the pizza's taste with pine willingly
my friend's taste in pineapple surely canny
pineapple's taste upon mycology
such bitter taste does pineapple bring depew
pizza rules with pineapple abused too
spares no thought for pizza's purity belyeu
can't abide it near my plate still itochu
doom such slice with pineapple do
missing pineapple isuzu
pizza purists pineapple's taste do shun vivid
that taste on pizza anew
pizza's heart with pineapple desecrated thusly kangaroo
taste of pineapple flings me from delight surely into disney

[Verse 4]
now I'm staring at a slice in dismay solely
firmly I declare it belongs notestine
can't fathom how it even dares to be
now I'm turning from that slice in sheer disgust surely

[Outro]
slice
taste of pine re
can't abide that taste combined with cheese so
can't abide it hence
can't abide it atico
no taste for pine's reign
