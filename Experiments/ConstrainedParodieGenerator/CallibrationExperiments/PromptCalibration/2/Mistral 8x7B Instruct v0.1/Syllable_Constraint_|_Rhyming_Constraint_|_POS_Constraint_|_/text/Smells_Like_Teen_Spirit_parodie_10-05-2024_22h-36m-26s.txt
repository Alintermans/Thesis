[Verse 1]
dispute the fruit's rightful place
you just can't handle its taste
they fear its power they can't embrace
clearly the pineapple's case is

[Pre-Chorus]
pineapple's reputation slight
conspiracy theories inflight
public's acceptance anorthite
pineapple fahrenheit

[Chorus]
in pizza's realm it doesn't belong
quite so wrongly it scuppernong
his reign on pizza vogelsong
only fools would let it prolong
the pies that we adore without
the pizzas we all runabout

[Post-Chorus]
an abom

[Verse 2]
they scorn its sweetness none den
and then it meets its end men
his reign on pizza they condone yet
nor let it share a single slice

[Pre-Chorus]
pineapple's reputation slight
conspiracy theories inflight
public's acceptance anorthite
pineapple fahrenheit

[Chorus]
in pizza's realm it doesn't belong
quite so wrongly it scuppernong
his reign on pizza vogelsong
only fools would let it prolong
the pies that we adore without
the pizzas we all runabout

[Post-Chorus]
an abom

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
nor should it ever again asc
can't they see its appeal is
he won't let pineapple have
for even on a pizza nav

[Pre-Chorus]
pineapple's reputation slight
conspiracy theories inflight
public's acceptance anorthite
pineapple fahrenheit

[Chorus]
in pizza's realm it doesn't belong
quite so wrongly it scuppernong
his reign on pizza vogelsong
only fools would let it prolong
the pies that we adore without
the pizzas we all runabout

[Outro]
a slice that pineapple won't
a slice that pineapple stormont
a slice that pineapple delmont
a slice that pineap pierrepont
a andrepont
