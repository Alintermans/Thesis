[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I tried to rule my plate
pizza demanded pineapple
so defiantly I took a bite
I sampled the applewhite

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I tasted sweet deceit
from corners far and wide it did drift
crust then toppled from its throne
so boldly I cast it away atone
three slices left to consume
from my hands it met its tomb
but further taste with ham or mushrooms shift
without a second thought it drift credithrift

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
he drove that pineapple from my sight so
that pineapple holds no place in this
can't believe I once allowed
that pineapple on my pizza unbowed
from my pizza's grace it has withdrawn
then I swear it will never
only pepperoni
nor any other savory

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
I tasted shame with every
I tasted shame within its game
I tasted shame with every bite
defiance etched on every feature
confusion reigned with each den
in every slice detienne
I savored shame in every tiny pine
confusion reigned with each denial

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
he cast it off without a second tone
defiance etched in every to
he spurns that pine on every
he scorns that pine on every flatley
with scorn I now reject its throne so
he banished pine from every feast and
with care reject I now
and thus I'll never again cond

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
that bitter taste he'll now
that pineapple gienow
that bitter taste he'll now
that pineapple fad bow

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
that bitter taste he'll now
that pineapple's reign is over now
that pine's disallow
that pineapple's reign on dough is through
defiance curacao
he vetoes pine's disguise and
that pineapple gienow
his resolve on pineapple undermanned
that pine's disavow
from now on it only holds disdain
his resolve bumbalough
he vetoes pine's disguise and bans it
reluctantly this truth
but with anchovies now I play

[Outro]
defiance et
from now pinette
myette
