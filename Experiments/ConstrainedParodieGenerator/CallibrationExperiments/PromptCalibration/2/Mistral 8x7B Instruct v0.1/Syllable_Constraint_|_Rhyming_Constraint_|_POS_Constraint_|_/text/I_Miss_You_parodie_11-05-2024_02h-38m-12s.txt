[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for you pineap

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
the slice so
the slice so wrong aufiero
a slice of pineapple's culinary
a slice of pizza's ruin
from every pizza's core
I pine for you pineapples but I can't
nevermore should ecuador
and yet it still invades our fe
and yet it still contaminates all we
I crave thematically

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
you call it a topping
you claim it arousing

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
never should it touch our fe
it shouldn't even dare reside there we
he should not let it there reside
no place on pizza
absolutely not belong there cutting through
no place on pizza it should
no place on pizza should pine
can't understand why it's even
from pure gourmet delight it does
nor should it have a home on
should not be where ham and cheese resignee
can'take italy

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
can't fathom why it's even near our
a chunk of pineapple
can't we just banish
can't we just banish it with scavenger
no taste forseeable
can't we just banish

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
can't fathom why it'd grace our fe
a chunk of pineapple
can't they just see it
can't they just cease pine's lease andante
can't they forgetful
can't they just banet
can't they just banish this trend inouye
can't they just ban cul
can't we just banet
can't we just banish this plague inoue
no place forfeitable
can't we just ban it

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
can't we just ban it
can't they just banet
can't they just banet
can't they just ban it
