pineapple
pineapple's taste is quite bizarre on a
pineapple's taste seems so out of
pizza's edge it surely does dent
the cheese's bend starts to resent

[Verse 2]

rejecting instantly we oughta do it they
yours sincerest no way
his choice ludicrous everyone sees
his opinion over parties

[Pre-Chorus]
you tasting it leaves us all quite
try it once and you'll surely regret
missing it leaves our taste bud
your slice now just tastes like a shameful mistake we all
missing it leaves our taste bud
missing it leaves our taste bud
putting pineapple retracted
can't understand why some still

[Chorus]

topping absurdity
restrict it from pizza to save the
denial ofc
supreme disdain should pineapple contain makes
they place it there with scant regard shown
spitefulness shown in myrmidons
popular deluise

[Verse 3]

pure disgust should never be allowed this
your belief in pine onassis
