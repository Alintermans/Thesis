[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've tried pizzas everywhere
I've tasted toppings sin
I've just tasted pine spare
lies a pepperoni
leftover pine on
but pineapple should not
or maybe with some ham let's dot the I'sinstead of

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
or maybe with some ham let's tie
justly shy away from
his taste preferences are quite
from greasy slices I rec
from such misapply
from such dubious
not at all on pineapple
excessive pine onus
his taste preferences thus

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
his taste preferences
his taste preference
his taste preferences
his taste preferences thus def
pizza dreams distresses
pizza deviance
pizza schemes dismisses
his taste preferences thus def
his taste preferences ref

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
its taste just doesn't belong
its taste just doesn't bond
its taste with scuppernong
its taste with what condone
its taste with ham or cone
the next line of the par
its taste with ham or none on that zone in hand

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
his taste preferences thus den
its taste with ham or none
his taste preferences thus den
its taste with ham or naught in
its taste with clarken
his taste preference
its taste with ham or none in
its taste with lone defrance

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
his taste preferences thus
his taste preferences thus

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
his taste preferences thus den
its taste with ham or none
its taste with ham or
its taste witherington
its taste with ham or never then
its taste with hamblen
its taste conqueror
its taste with clingerman

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
reluctantly bit
reluctantly bite your
reluctantly bite your tongue on
with skepticism sharp and
his taste disparate
his taste preference
hesitantly step back from
reluctantly clearance
his taste preferences once

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
its taste with ham or none in hand
its taste with ham or neverland
its taste with ham or heldenbrand
