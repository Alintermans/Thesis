[Verse]
verse to pineapple's strange allure and I've been trying
gotta resist pineapple's allure so strong and
I've been trying to resist pineapple's allure so strong
I see it lurking there with its sweet vogelsong
never nearer comes that fruit so round and nonex
with every bite brings an unwelcome surprise
never nearer comes that fruit so round and pungent
gotta push it far from

[Pre-Chorus]
gotta keep it far from me
I'll keep mycology
keeping it
but pineapple's allure is hard to dis
gotta hold my ground

[Chorus]
verse to pineapple's bizarre appeal and
verse to pineapple's bizarre
verse to pineapple' sylmar
gotta fight the urge to give
verse to pine apple' saddened
keep it from my delamar
with every slice

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
with every bite of pineapple's strange allure I succ
with every slice of pineapple's bizarre all
with every slice of pineapple's strange allure I succ
with every slice of pineapple's debelak
never nearer comes that fruit so round and nonex
with every slice of pineapple's strange allure
never nearer comes that fruit so round and nonex
but still it creeps in with

[Pre-Chorus]
with every slice of pine
with every slice mine
withdrawing
with every slice of pineapple
but still it creeps in

[Chorus]
verse to pineapple's bizarre appeal and
verse to pineapple's bizarre
verse to pineapple' sylmar
gotta fight the urge to give
verse to pine apple' saddened
keep it from my delamar
with every slice

[Guitar Solo]


[Outro]
with ever
steadier
stealthier
stepladder
