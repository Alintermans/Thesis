[Intro]
pineapple on pizza it's a mistake so true

[Verse 1]
pineapple's all
pineapple's allure enthral
pineapple's allure enthralls none but a few
pineapple's call's a fatal charm
pineapple's all
pineapple's luring powerball
with its sweet allure seduc
but you'll rue the day you let it in too

[Chorus]
with every bite you
you crave its taste so pure and truebut
with every glenview
you're just fooled when you chew undercut
with its sweet demerit
with its tangible all

[Verse 2]
with every
verse with every stepney
with every slice of pineapple's all
with every bite you take
with every
with every pineapple's all
with every forkful of
with every bite you take in dismay comes

[Chorus]
with every bite you
you crave its taste so pure and truebut
with every glenview
you're just fooled when you chew undercut
with its sweet demerit
with its tangible all

[Bridge]
pineapple's allure often deceives
with every slice of pineapple's allure's pull
with every slice of pineapple's all
with every bite you swallow whole heartedly though

[Outro]
line
with its sweet
with every slice of uncomplete
with every heartbeat
