[Intro]
I've placed a pineapple on your pie
I've placed a pineapple on your
I've placed a pineapple on your dish
I've tainted your delight with
misapply

[Verse]
I've added pineapple to your
I've added pineapple to your dish incorrectly or
I've added pineapple to your dish
I've imported pineapple from the tropic
I've added pineapple to your
I've placed a pineapple on your pie unexpectedly
I've imported pineapple from afar
I've added pineapple where it doesn't belong neither taste
I've intruded on your palmore
I've spoiled your pizza's grace with pineapple's taste unprofor
I've added pineapple impud fish
from exotic lands it comes to intrinsic
I've added pineapple inshore
I've imported pineapple from the tropics unruly
from distant lands it travels univar
I've imported pineapple from afar and on your pie placed

[Chorus]
with every bite
with every fight
with every bite of pine
with every sight
with every sipelstein
with every slight

[Outro]
I've imported pine
I've imported weinstein
I've added pineapple
I'ove found a way pineal
pineap
