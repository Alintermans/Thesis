[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria, the aroma filled the air but something about it felt wrong, beyond compare they had pineapple on the menu, I couldn't believe my eyes how could they do this to a classic, it's such a crime verse 2 oh, the thought of it still haunts me, like a bad dream the sweet taste of tomato sauce, ruined by a fruit that's not clean I can't imagine the flavors, they just don't blend it's like putting ketchup on a steak, it's just not right, my friend pre-chorus and I know it's a popular topping, but to me it's a sin I can't believe they'd do this to a beautiful thing pizza is a work of art, a masterpiece, a delight but pineapple on top, it's just not right chorus 'cause there we are again, in the pizza shop with a pie that's been desecrated, it's just not the same wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well down the stairs, I was there I remember it all too well it was rare, I was there I remember it all too well verse 3 photo of a pizza, with pineapple on top it's a crime against humanity, a culinary flop I can't believe they'd do this, it's such a shame they're ruining a classic, it's not the same verse 4 they say variety is the spice of life, but this is just wrong pineapple doesn't belong, it's a crime that can't be undone I'll stick to my pepperoni, it's the classic way pineapple on pizza, no thanks, I'll pass bridge maybe we can compromise, a separate pie for me no pineapple in sight, just the way it's meant to be I'll take a bite, and savor the taste no fruit on my pizza, that's the way it's meant to be chorus 'cause there we are again, in the pizza shop with a pie that's been desecrated, it's just not the same wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well down the stairs, I was there I remember it all too well it was rare, I was there I remember it all too well outro so let's all agree, no pineapple on pizza it's a crime against humanity, let's not do this let's keep it classic, the way it's meant to be no pineapple on pizza, that's just the way it's got to be.
