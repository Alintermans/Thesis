[Verse]
I've dug a hole for pineapple

oh man what a world the things I hear
if I could ban it from pizza I would cheer
some like it sweet some like it hot
but pineapple on pizza just ain't what we got it
it ruins the flavor it ruins the
taste and you'd have thought that I would let it pass and let it slide
well pizza is pictured forsell
and I don't wanna let it go so inedible
I've dug a hole for pine disappear
can't pretend that it's a fitting fryrear
oh man what a world the things lot
if I could act on my revenge no would I ignore it
some like it sweet some like it hotlanta
but pineapple on pizza just ain't what we notified

[Chorus]

in my stomach it will rot
in my st tacit
in my stomach it will rot
in my st tacit

[Outro]
in my stomach it
won't ever it vitt
is my disgust your cra
is all of my disgust your cra
