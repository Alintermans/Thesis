[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong it was
like a crime scene without a care vaporware

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory craving sang
we're ordering at the counter getting lost
in a sea of options autumn leaves falling down
like our expectations for a tast rang

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that flavor's not here no more
and I might be okay but my taste buds are not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there we are again on that little pie
you almost ruined it cause you were looking over at me
pepperoni in my hair
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza on the menu counter was it
your cheeks were turning red you used to be a little kid ecevit
and your mother's telling stories bout you on the pepperonc
you told me bout your past thinking your future was me
and you were tossing me the slice keys f the patriarchy
pizza chain on the ground we were always skipping
town and I was thinking on the drive down any time
now he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it
was til we were dead and gone and
buried check the pulse and come back swearing it
s the same after three months
in the grave and then you wondered where it went to as you
reached for me but all I felt was shame and you held lit

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there we are again in the middle of the
night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refe reputedly
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
sacred prayer and we'd fer
to remember it all too well yeah

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a master peace
til you tore it all
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
cause I remember it all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you who
was weeping in a party bathroom
some actress asking me what happened you
that's what happened you
you who charmed my taste buds with self effacing
jokes sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the pizza delivery guy all night
willing you to come and he said it's supposed to be fun

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after pizza nights and days when you made me your own
now you take back my slice and I walk home alone
but you keep my old favorite topping from that
very first pie cause it reminds you of innocence
and it smells like me you get
rid of it cause you remember it

[Chorus]
cause there we are again when I loved you
so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
wind in my hair you were cause
you remember it all
down the stairs you were cause
you remember it all
it was rare I was was
there I remember it all too

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pizza stays my age
from when your pepperoni broke my heart
and I'm a soldier who's returning half her
weight and did the oven burn paint you
blue just between us did the love affair mailloux
you too cause in this city
barren cold I still remember the first
slice I ever had and how it
glistened as it fell I howitt

[Outro]
just between us did the pizza affair maim you all too
well just between us do you remember itochu
all too well just between us I remember it all too soohoo
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it aouzou
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it avenue

[Spoken Outro]
