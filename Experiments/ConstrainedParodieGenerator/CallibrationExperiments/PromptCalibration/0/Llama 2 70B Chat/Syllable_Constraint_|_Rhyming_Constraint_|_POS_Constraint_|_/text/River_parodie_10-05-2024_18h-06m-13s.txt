ain't no way pineapple belongs on
a pie with its weird flavor and spiky can't compreh
end why people like it on their pizza it's a trend that needs to end
like a disease it spreads like
wildfire and it's getting out of control like a child
and I'm trying to put out the fire ascap
e without a fire extinguisher ain't no way
to put out the flames that burn when
pineapple touches a perfectly good pie crust ain

a one slice pizza with pepperoni
and sausage and mushrooms and peppers and olive
s was perfect then came the pineapple and
ruined the whole dish now it's not worth a dam
ain't no way to salvage the flavor allingham
left is to toss it in the trash can't reprogram
my taste buds to enjoy the sweetness that pineapple brings
can't enjoy the spiky texture that it brings to my tongue anagram
ain't no way to make it right so let's just avoid the fight and keep
it off the menu that's the best endings
to this long war that's been waging for far too long ain
t no way to make it right so let's just avoid tottenham
and keep it off the menu that's the beckham
ain't no way to make it right pegram

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride he
fuck can I say if life wasilewski
highway and deceit was an enclave id be swerving in
five lanes speeds at a high rate like im slidin on ice
maybe that's why I may have came at you
sideways I can't keep straight
but I made you terminate my mozz slice
this love triangle left us in a fork tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bed I really woulda loved your smile
didint really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a hater tried to ru
in a perfectly good pie
been a fool thought pineapple belonged on a pie in the ski
all my sins need
afridi
holy moly little one I don't
to admit
that pineapple don't nonchal
ly belong on a pie so let's just ariel
it off the sinead
