[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza crust so fine
it makes me wanna crystalline
I wish it washable

[Verse 1]
give me a moment to collect my thoughtfulness for
an explanation ofer
to write a poem of desp
iting the combination
do you taste the flavor profile
or do you just ignore the style
when you ordered a hawai
was I even on your plate I knew imbecile
you'd do the opposite o peristyle
and I'd end up more irate don't say it is not fair costabile
you clearly weren't aware
that you made me so miser
able so if you really wanna noe what to do
just avoid the pineapple too

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza crust so
fine it makes me wanna crystalline I wish it was
hable I wish it wasn't real what a horrible mejias
I'm happier than ever

[Verse 2]
you come to me with a suggestion
of a pineapple pizza fusion
driving me crazy with your insistution
you scared me to death but I'm justesen
my breath cause you only list
to your fuckin' cravings I don
relate to you I don't rel
ate to you no aol

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about your pizza preferenc
ces on the internet never told pe
ople anything bad cause that shits embarrass
ing you were my everything andreini
g you did was make me fuckin' mad so
don't waste the time I donahey
have and don't try to make me feel bad Iahey Iahey I
could talk about every time that you showed up on
time but I'd have an empty line cause you never did ne
er paid any mind to my taste ormiston

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone yeah fuck you
