[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me somethin
is pineapple on pizza really
somethin' that you need
or is it just a silly frenzied

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm callin
in all the good slices I find myelin
for change
and in the bad times I fear my taste

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me somethin
boy aren't you tired of that hawai
ian punch or do
you need more ain't it hard keepin you

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in all the good slices I find my longing
for change
and in the bad times I fear my taste

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the shallot now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow in
the sha ha sha la la la low in
the sha ha shallow weylin
we're far from the shallot now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the shallot now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow
in the sha ha shimmy lazaro
in the sha haavelmo
we're far from the shallot now
