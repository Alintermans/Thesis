[Verse]
comin' out of my kitchen and I've been cookin' just
gotta gotta be hot because I want it all
it started out with a pineapple how did it end up
like this it was only a pineapple pileup
now I'm fallin' asleep and my stomach is sick
and he's eatin' a pizza while she's takin' a
dragon breath mints because the pineapple is mak
in' her mouth feel like a

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's touchin' his tongue now
he takes off anyhow
let me go
because I just can't look it's killin
me and my taste bud

[Chorus]
pineapple turnin' pizza into a
wastebin swimmin' through che
ap excuses chikane
but it's just the price I pay
dominos ishikawa
open up my gassaway
'cause I'm mr picky

[Guitar Solo]
