[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the blasphemy against the fine
against the culinary design
I should've avoided it time
if the flavors ever did speak
pineapple's the last thing
I'd want on my pizza surowiec
every mozambique
it's getting worse each week my taste bud
my tongue offers no absolutes
I was born to savor the flavor
but pineapple ruins it all in
the only pizza I been
sent to is when it's unloaded
I was born to love it

[Pre-Chorus]
a pizza
a pepita

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the shrine of the
chef's creation I'll tell you my cravings and you
can sharpen your knife offer
me that perfect slice oh pettigrew
let mejia
give you my life take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship at the shrine of the chef's cefalu
I'll tell you my crazier
cravings and you can sh harju

[Verse 2]
if I'm a pagan of the good times
my pizza's the sunlight
to keep the flavor on my side
it demands a sacrifice
drain the whole ocean get something to
satisfy my appetite som
ething meaty for aplomb
that's a fine lookin' pizza
what you got in theophila
we've a lot of star vincentia
that looks tasty that

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the shrine of the
chef's creation I'll tell you my cravings and you
can sharpen your knife offer
me that perfect slice oh pettigrew
let mejia
give you my life take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship at the shrine of the chef's cefalu
I'll tell you my crazier
cravings and you can sh harju

[Bridge]
no pineapple on my pizza when the craving
begins there is no sweeter taste than our genuine
cravings in the madness and soil of that saucy
scene only then I am human only then ivey

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the shrine of the
chef's creation I'll tell you my cravings and you
can sharpen your knife offer
me that perfect slice oh pettigrew
let mejia
give you my life take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship at the shrine of the chef's cefalu
I'll tell you my crazier
cravings and you can sh harju
