[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza
toppings would please when I gave the
word now in the morning I eat it
alone sweets would babysit

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to pick the to
ppings that felt the fear in my belly
listen as my stomach would
sing now the old pizza is easterwood
and I discovered that the
toppings stand upon myrna
and myrna of salt and myrna of sand
because pineapple should never gilleland

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear taste buds a ringin' complaining
flavor cavalry choirs singing wrong
be my mirror my pizza and
shield my missionaries in newfoundland
for some reason I can't explain
once you've had pineapple there
was never never a
delicious pizza and that was

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild cra
ving blew down the box to let me
in shattered slices and the sound of
thunder people couldn't believe what did
revolutionaries wait
for a pizza with pine abate
just a puppet on a lonely string mumma
oh who would ever wanna be king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear taste buds a ringin' complaining
flavor cavalry choirs singing wrong
be my mirror my pizza and
shield my missionaries in newfoundland
for some reason I can't explain
I know pizza without pineapple won
call my name never an
honest word but that was when it

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh wo oh
oh oh wo ohio
oh oh oh oh wo oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh wo oh
hear taste buds a ringin' complaining
oh oh wo ohio
flavor cavalry choirs singing wrong
oh oh oh oh wo oh
be my mirror my pizza and
oh oh oh oh wo oh
shield my missionaries in newfoundland
oh oh oh oh wo oh
for some reason I can't explain
oh oh oh oh wo oh
I know pizza without pineapple won
call my name never an
oh oh oh oh wo oh an hon
