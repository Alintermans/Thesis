[Verse 1]
twenty years with this endless
struggle to remove that pineapple pester
from the savory dish
I tried to reason with those who insist
that this tropical fruit adds flavor to blissful dish
but what does it truly

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to vent my frustration overhead
and I weary in the morning when I step outs
and I take a deep breath and shake my head in disbel
and I shout from the top of my lungs full of
disgust and disdain for this trend that
has taken hold

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyeyey heyhey
I said he
I said hey what's this pineapple
heyeyeyey heyhey hayashi
I said he
I said pineapple heberle

[Verse 2]
and I ple
oh my gaglione
I plea all the time
in this culinary
and I pray
oh my god giveaway
I pray every single day
for sanitary

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to vent my frustration overhead
and I weary in the morning when I step outs
and I take a deep breath and I get real high again
and I shout from the top of my lungs full of
disgust and disdain for this absurd
pizza topping

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyeyey heyhey
I said he
I said pineapple heber
I said hegemony

I said pineapple heberer
and I say honeybee

[Outro]
twenty years and my life is
trying to get rid of this pineapple aff
for a salvation I year
