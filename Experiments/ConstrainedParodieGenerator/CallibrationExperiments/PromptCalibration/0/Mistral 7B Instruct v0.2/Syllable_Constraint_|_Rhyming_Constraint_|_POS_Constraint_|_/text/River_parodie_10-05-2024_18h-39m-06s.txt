[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pirate leading a
been a jester causing a
been a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on

the truth and my lies now

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he brings it home sliced on his pizza plate to
jack daniels and tomato sauce
but she hates it with a passion so
it's a battle in the kitchen heated andrew
he insists it complements the dish butala
she's determined to set this debate al
and claims it's an affront to italian cuisine so raw
now they're on a collision course like a runaway carnival ride
it's a standoff in the pan
and she's got a can of pineapple chunks ready to brand
'cause she's devoted to tradition andolina
and you don't mix fruit with savory dishes even
I know she's cooking up a plan
and I'm the unwitting pawn in her culinary
'cause she's a purist and I'm a fan of the sweet and the savory
but I should've listened to mycology
after the first bite but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pirate leading a

the truth and my lies now

[Verse 2: Eminem]
one slice led to two and then to three nights
it was love at first bite but now it's sour and
he confessed his love for the tropical fruit
but she felt betrayed and left in the lurch and
now how am I supposed to tell this girl beforehand
it's tough to find the words I'm awkward and maryland
don't want this to hurt but what she deserves is the truth
so I retreat to the kitchen like a secret hideout room underfund
I just feel like the person I'm becoming is irreversible
I justified my actions maryruth
and now that I've tasted her disapproval I don
t want her anymore I've moved on to someone newfoundland
why do I do this thing that I do ohland
get on my soapbox and preach meadowland
pineapples belong on hogeland
'cause now with her in the oven I can't bring her
into this world should've known I should've
used protection in the
fridge before I bit into your for orland
fruit salad disasterland oh my godlandlandlandlandland

always the adventurous one in the
kitchen trying out exotic newsy
fruit on my pizza but now I see the error of ways
speeds at a high rate in my haste unable to pause
that's why I may have acted in a has
I can't keep my choices
but I made her raise our chickasaws
this flavor war left us in a wreck twisted and
what else can I say it was fun for a while
but I really would've loved her style
didn't really wanna terminate our
baby but what's one more lie to tell our
