[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something's true
does a pineapple on pizza make
your taste buds renew
or do you crave a more sakau

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm reco
in all the good slices I find myself gro
anin
for change and in the bad pies I fear

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something's right
should a pineapple on pizza ignite
your palate's might
or do you tire of this monot night

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in all the good dishes I find myself ling
on change
and in the bad plates I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the savory deep endwatch as
I reject the pineap
le as I crash through the surface where they can
't impose their palate's plan

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha tomatoesaa
in the sha tomato lafata
in the sha tomatoesaa
we're far from the boring now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the savory deep endwatch as
I reject the pineap
le as I crash through the surface where they can
't impose their palate's plan

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha tomatoes
in the sha tomato lakatos
in the sha tomatoes
we're far from the boring now
