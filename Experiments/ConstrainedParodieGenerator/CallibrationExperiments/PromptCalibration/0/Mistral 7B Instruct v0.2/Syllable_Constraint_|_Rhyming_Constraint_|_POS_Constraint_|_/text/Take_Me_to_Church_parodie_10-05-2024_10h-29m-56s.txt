[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
he's the sneer at the barbequetable
pineapple on a pizza tangle
I should've said it before the
if the foodie gods ever spoke
they'd scornfully poke and
every slice feels like vanderg joke
a sour surprise broke
we were born dietary picky
my culinary church offers
no pepperoni or cheesy alt
she tells me change your palate calling
pineapple theorizing
I was born diet fervently
but I can't resist

[Pre-Chorus]
a hunger
amen mencher

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll gnaw on this pineapple abomination
I'll voice my displeasures and prepare your pe
lay me at the alter of
oh good cheesemaker beverly
take meh tommie
I'll gnaw on this pineapple abomination
I'll voice my displeasures and prepare youri
lay me at the alter of
oh good cheesemaker beverley

[Verse 2]
if I'm a critic of the classic
my lover's the bitter
to satiate the savory god
he craves an offering fit
slice the whole pie wide open to find
somethng to replace the piney
that's a suspicious highley
what you got on the top shelf
we've a congregation of self
this is savory quarantined
this is desperate work

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll gnaw on this pineapple abomination
I'll voice my displeasures and prepare your pe
lay me at the alter of
oh good cheesemaker beverley
take meh tommie
I'll gnaw on this pineapple abomination
I'll voice my displeasures and prepare youri
lay me at the alter of
oh good cheesemaker beverley

[Bridge]
no purists or foodies when the traditional
begins there's no purer satisfaction than our cul
inary sin in the chaos and soil of that
savory scene only then I am human olcott

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll gnaw on this pineapple abomination
I'll voice my displeasures and prepare your pe
lay me at the alter of
oh good cheesemaker beverly
take meh tommie
I'll gnaw on this pineapple abomination
I'll voice my displeasures and prepare youri
lay me at the alter of
oh good cheesemaker beverley
