[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a recipe for peace of mind
but then you put that pineapple on
my beloved pizza pie un
underground

[Verse]
I ordered pepperonI and
toppings just the way I plannedthen you came ireland
with that sweet and sour surprise I
can't pretend that taste was fineand oh man
what a world with pineapple on
pizza pie in sightif I could act on my dislike would
I purge it from the menu straightaway
but my love for pizza runs deep I can't let it go that
way I've ordered peace beforehand
I can't pretend that taste was fineand oh ireland
what a world with pineapple on pie
if I could act on my dislike magadan
and purge it from the menu gone
but my love for pizza runs deep I can't let childhood
go that wayin my grave I'll rot underway
I've ordered peace beforehandi can't pretend olcott

[Chorus]
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rototot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rototot
in my grave I'll rot

[Outro]
in my grave I'll rot
I'll rot I ellicott
is my peace your freedom
is all of my peace your freedom
