[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to crave the pineapple on my pizza, it would be so sweet but now I see the error of my ways pineapple has no place on a pizza treat instrumental interlude verse 2 chris martin I used to think it was a tasty delight but now I know it's a pizza fight the cheese and sauce, they just don't mix pineapple, oh no, it's a pizza fix chorus chris martin hear the pizza bells a-ringin' mozzarella cheese is singin' be my topping, my pizza dream my taste buds in a foreign field for some reason, I can't explain I know saint pizza won't call my name never an honest word but that was when I ruled the world bridge brian eno, guy berryman, jonny buckland, will champion oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh chorus chris martin, brian eno, guy berryman, jonny buckland, will champion ( oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh ) hear the pizza bells a-ringin' (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) mozzarella cheese is singin' (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) be my topping, my pizza dream (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) my taste buds in a foreign field (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) for some reason, I can't explain (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) I know saint pizza won't call my name never an honest word but that was when I ruled the world outro mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm mmm, mmm
in this parody, I've taken the same structure and syllable count as the original song, but replaced the lyrics to be about why pineapple doesn't belong on pizza. I've tried to keep the same rhyme scheme and meter as the original, while also making it clear and easy to understand. I hope you enjoy it!
