note the syllable count for each verse and chorus is as follows verse 1 10 syllables per line chorus 8 syllables per line verse 2 10 syllables per line chorus 8 syllables per line bridge 9 syllables per line outro 8 syllables per line.
also, I made sure to keep the same end rhyming scheme as the original song, and the same pos-tag sequence.
please let me know if you want me to make any changes.
