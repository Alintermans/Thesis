[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I tried to put pineapp
on a pizza once beforehand
but now I see it's just a sinful
disaster waiting atmel

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
it's like a tropical
invasion of the tastebuds with
sweetness overload and no
justification for the mess ito
pineapples don't belong
on a pizza hindelong
and I thought I ruled the world beforehand
with pineapple on pizza as my command

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringin' in
pineapple cavalry choirs are sing
remove it from the menu and
restore the pizza's dignity myhand
for some reason I can't explain
once you added pineapple
never an honest word
and that was when pineapple ruled

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a tropical and wild
delusion of the tastebud
expectations shattered and the sound
pineapple does not belongon a pie
peaceful revolution wa
for the return of aurea
pizza to its former glory without the
threat of pineapple invasion once

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringin' in
pineapple cavalry choirs are sing
remove it from the menu and
restore the pizza's dignity myhand
for some reason I can't explain
once you added pineapple did never
an honest word and that
was when pineapple ruled the world
