[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie
my taste buds beg to differ icky
shouldn't be a surprise pharmacy
it's not a topping I adore
like a sweetness overload in
my pizza cries for more
a tomato base is myelin
no tropical vixen
my pizza will decline her invite
it's a pineapple fiasco
I can't abide icky toppings
no pineapple on my pie icky
can't stand theology
when it comes to toppings I quite
clinging to tradition

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no oh
amen ditto

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll eat like a maniac at the table of
my pizza cries for more variety icky
don't bring pineapple to
my pizza dinner canterbury
I canada
my pizza will decline her invitation love
it's a pineapple disaster icky icy
can't stand theophila
when it comes to toppings I quite me

[Verse 2]
in the land of pizza paradise
we don't need no al
pineapple on the rise icky
my taste buds beg to differ
shouldn't be a surprise pharmacy
it's not a topping I ad ore
like a sweetness superstore
my pizza cries for more iced
a tomato base poltergeist
no tropical virology
my pizza refus

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll eat like a maniac at the table of
my pizza cries for more variety icky
don't bring pineapple ton
my pizza dinner canterbury
I canada
my pizza will decline her invitation love
it's a pineapple disaster icky icy
can't stand theoph ixion
when it comes to toppings I quite me

[Bridge]
no masters or kings in the pizza empire
just give me a cheese pie icy icy icy icy
my pizza cries for more variety icky
not a fan of tropical vixen icky racy

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no oh icks
amen dit fix

[Chorus]
take me to the

my pizza cries for more variety icky
