[Verse 1]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pie
it's a topping that just doesn
don't belong in the sky high
it's a flavor that don't mix with the cheese and
the sauce and the meat can't
get along without a fight

[Pre-Chorus]
we never should have started this fight
why are we always defending the right
to put something so wrong
on a pizza that's supposed to light
up our lives with delight andesite
we never learn berrrr long

[Chorus]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pie
it's a topping that just don't
get along with the methadone
it's a flavor that don't belong in
the pizza that we all call home
we gotta get away from zone

[Verse 2]
there's tomato and mushroom and pepper too
but pineapple is the one
that makes me say boo to you
it's like a crime scene in my mouth full of
fire and brim stone instead
of the flavors iou

[Pre-Chorus]
we never should have started this fight
why are we always defending the right
to put something so wrong
on a pizza that's supposed to light
up our lives with delight andesite
we never learn berrrr long

[Chorus]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pie
it's a topping that just don't
get along with the methadone
it's a flavor that don't belong in the
pizza that we all call homewe
gotta get away andrepont

[Pre-Chorus]
we never should have started this fight
why are we always defending the right
to put something so wrong
on a pizza that's supposed to light
up our lives with delight andesite
we never learn berrrr long

[Bridge]
we shoulda known better
we coulda kept it
in its natural state
but now it's too late
we gotta face the
heat we've created

[Outro]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pieeeeeeeeee in
we gotta get away
we gotta get away we gotta getaway
we gotta get away we gotta get away
we gotta get away we ga
we gotta get away we ha
we gotta get away we ha
