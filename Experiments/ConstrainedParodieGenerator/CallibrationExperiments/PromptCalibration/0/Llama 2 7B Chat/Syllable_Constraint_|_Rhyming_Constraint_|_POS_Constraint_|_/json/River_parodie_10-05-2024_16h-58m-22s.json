He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a fan of pineapple\non my pizza had to take\nbeen a lover of the sweet and tangy taste for years now it\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is hate\nmy love for pineapple now is falling downstate\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with his pepperoni red\nlovin' every bite of it\nsweat drippin' from his brow as he takes\nthat first bite of pineapple and he cadenhead\nhe knows he'll never be the same again glenfed\nhe's addicted to that sweet tropical\ntaste and he can't stop himself from going back for more\njust when he thought it was safe to eat a slice without pineapple on\nit creeps its way back onto\nthe pie and he's left with no choice but to admit defeat\nhe's a slave to his cravings and he featherbed\ngives in to the temptation and takes another bite of\nthat spicy tropical delight\nknowing full well he'll be sorry tomorrow morning\nbut he just can't resist that sweet and savory flavor they\nfound a loophole in the toppings rulemaking\npineapple a permanent fixture on\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a fan of pineapple\non my pizza had to take\nbeen a lover of the sweet and tangy taste for years now it\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is hate\nmy love for pineapple now is falling downstate\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one time pineapple on my pizza\nmade me feel like a king for a day but now it\nit's just not the same without that tropical\nflavor and I can't help but wonder what\nI've been a fan of pineapple on my pawtuxet\nhe had to take a break from it for a while toilet\nnow he's back and he's loving it more than ever before\ncan't get enough of that sweet and savory tastefor pawtuxet\njust when he thought it was safe to eat a slice without pineapple on\nit creeps its way back onto theodore\nand he's left with no choice but to admit defeat to\ngives in to the temptation and takes another delicate\nbite of pineapple knowing full willamette\nhe'll be sorry tomorrow morning but\nhe just can't resist tunicate\nfound a loophole in the toppings rulemakingp\npineapple a permanent fixture on\nso let the river run\nit's just not the same without that tunicate\nflavor and I can't help but wonder what could have been if\ni\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's macaroni\nmy name\nri\nriver run\ncall me pizzimenti\nriver run macaron purrington\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the bridesmaid never pineapple\nhey could have done it better witherell\nfuck can I say life was a highway and deception was\nan enclave I'd be swerving in five lanes at a high\nrate like I'm sliding on ice maybe that\nwhy I may have came at you\nsideways but I can't keep mollify\nlies and now my love for pineapple is falling\ndownstate and I can't help but wonder what\nI could have done different if that\npineapple a permanent fixture on top\nmy love for pineapple now is falling down\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a fan of pineapple\non my pizza had to take\nbeen a lover of the sweet and tangy taste for years now it\nwell little one\nI don' fit\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif it's all\n\ngonna cause is pain my love for\npineapple now is falling downstate sojourner\n",
