[Verse]
emerging from my home and I've been doing just fine
mustard bottle in hand looking for that slice oh
it started out as a joke how did it end up like this
pineapple on a pizza ain't theorists
now I'm falling asleep with heartburn and regret
while others indulge in this culinary threat
now they're eating away and my stomach's a mess
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savoring the taste
it's in such poor taste faced
let me go
and I just can't look it makes me feel
gastric distress so

[Chorus]
jealousy rises as innocence falls
swimming through this food scandal
retching at your rational
but it's just the price we pay
distaste is calling appalls
open up my critical
eyes I'm mr bright

[Guitar Solo]
