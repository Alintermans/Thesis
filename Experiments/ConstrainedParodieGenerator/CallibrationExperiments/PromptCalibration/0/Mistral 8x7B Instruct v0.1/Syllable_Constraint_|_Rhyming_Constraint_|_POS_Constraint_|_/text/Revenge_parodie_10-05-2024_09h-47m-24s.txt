I've burned two pies for us my friend
can't pretend that I did well inventing this trend blend
oh man what a dish the things I send
if I could take it back now would I ever
some serve pineapple on pizza
and you'd have thought that I would never commit such heres
well broken tastebuds will never heal
and I don't wanna taste it again so in the bin it
will burn two pies for us my friend
can't pretend that I did well inventing this trend blend
oh man what a dish the things I send
if I could take it back now would I ever
some serve pineapple onoda
and you'd have thought that I would never commit such heres
well broken tastebuds will never heal
and I don't wanna taste it again so inabinet
