[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in sheer disbelief somehow
and I spit it out in the trash with disgust
you just laughed and said it's a del filyaw

[Verse 2]
oh my god that taste it's like a curse word spoken in
a church full of people who love pepperon
pineapple has no place on a slice of pizza
it's a sin and I can't believe itkin

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's not allowed
and I can't understand
why anyone would choose to eat it willingly
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it is again on that triangle
my mouth says no but my eyes say yes please take it away from
me I remember it all
too well it's a travesty it

[Verse 3]
canned fruit on a savory pie it makes no sense to me
it's like putting pickles on a cupcake and calling it achebe
the texture the sweetness it just doesn't belong on pizza
it's a monstrosity and I can't believe you
and I used to be so close together now we donahue
fighting over whether pineapple belongs it
doesn't matter what you say I won't believe it
it's a crime against pizza and I can't forgive it
after all the delicious slic
es I've had in my life you put pineapple
on a pizza and expect
me to call it good it's a travesty it's a sin it
should be illegal it's a crime it's asexual

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
cause there it is again on that triangle of
disappointment you call a pizza I remember manlove
it all too well it's a
travesty it's a sin it's a
shame it's a disgrace it's a mistake it's a crime it
should be illegal it's a sin it's a shame it's a dis
grace it's alethea
and you call it pizza again just

[Bridge]

I expected too much from
a simple slice of pizza but you let
me down you let me
