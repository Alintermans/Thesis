[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple on your
slice a turnoff that just can't slide off your tongue quite right
does it clash with ham like red and purple
color schemes that make your stomach
churn and question your life choices this night
have you no shame in your game as you order a pie
with fruit atop it andesite
'cause there's this debate that
rages online about what should be allowed on a pizza
and it keeps me awake as I wipe away tears

[Pre-Chorus]
should pineapple stay or should it go away from
pizza toppings listed on menus countrywide now
baby we both know that pizza is sacred food
for eatin' savory flavors without anyhow

[Chorus]
fightin' against pine
ever thought of decidin
what aol
I wasserstein
maybe she' fine
with fruit on her pie
but I won't adhere line
by line byzantine
arguments divine

[Verse 2]
so do you agree to
banish pineapple to the side of the
pizza box never to return topeka
simmer down and savor the classics like pepperoni
or sausage or mushrooms or peppers or onions to name a
few that won't clash with your palate oriola
and we can enjoy our meal together the

[Pre-Chorus]
should pineapple stay or should it go away from
pizza toppings listed on menus countrywide now
baby we both know that pizza is sacred food
for eatin' savory flavors without anyhow

[Chorus]
way pizza was meant to be savored in
all its glory without pine
we won't be aherin
to trends that are malign tomberlin
for pizza is best when it's pure and fine
without pineapple to inter
fere with our glycogen
as we enjoy kin
shipping peterkin

[Outro]
should pineapple stay or should it go away from
pizza toppings listed on menus countrywide now
baby we both know that pizza is sacred food
for eatin' savory flavors without anyhow
should pineapple stay or should it go away from men
us now baby we both know that pizza is sacred
food for eatin' savory flavors we won't conced
