[Intro]
come on folks, we all wanna speak out on this ver

[Verse 1]
firm stance taken
pineapple's not partisan
I want you to take a slice off your plate now
why don't we leave it at that
no debate brew
it just doesn't go with tofu
the taste is simply taboo
and I'm the one who will shout it out now

[Chorus]
in this dish it just won
it's not the same as it once begun
in this dish weiseman
it's not the same as it once begun
as it begun asian
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
ham and cheese stand tall cornwall
why would you put it there at all marin
it just doesn't belong in
callin' the shots
pineapple rots in hot spots rot
our tastebuds cry out
we just wish you'd take it all out now somehow

[Chorus]
in this dish it just won
it's not the same as it once begun
in this dish weiseman
it's not the same as it once begun
as it begun asian
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
hide it away don't display it that
way it's not the same as it was back then saturday
toss it aside don't disguise it that
way it's not the same as it was back then on satur

[Outro]
hey
as it was
you know it's not the same forages
as it was forages
