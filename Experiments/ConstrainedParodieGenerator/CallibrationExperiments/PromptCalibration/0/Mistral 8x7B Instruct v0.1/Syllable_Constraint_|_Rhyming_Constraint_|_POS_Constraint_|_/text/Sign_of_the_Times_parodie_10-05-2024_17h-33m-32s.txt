[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
it's a culinary crime
don't you think it's gross inside
you can't cover up the taste with extra cheese
it's just wrong on a pizza
it's a crime against the bread

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food that
we chew and chewy che
we've been here before complaining too
the chefs and waiters bring us newmarket
dishes daily duarte

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away andis
put down that pineapple slice and hear me
we gotta get away from this
we gotta get away andis

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
the flavors clash and fight wars
confusion reigns supreme so

pizza anymore soho

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before complaining to
the chefs and waiters about the food that
we chew and chewy che
we've been here before complaining too
the chefs and waiters bring us newmarket
dishes daily duarte

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice and hear my ple
