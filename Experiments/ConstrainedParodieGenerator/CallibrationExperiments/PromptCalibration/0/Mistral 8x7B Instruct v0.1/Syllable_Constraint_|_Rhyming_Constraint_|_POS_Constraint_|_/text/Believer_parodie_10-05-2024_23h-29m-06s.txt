[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on my pizza
I won't stand for it no more
it's a culprit that I can't
forgive ya for oh grigio pant

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare put it on my slice again please
I'm the one in charge here
I know what tastes good on my cheese oh
the master of my chesebro

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised with good taste from the
start now I'm spreading the word afar
writing my poems for the few
that know that pineapple does not belong on pizza
it's a sin that I must fight and
remove it from my life oh sweet
marinara sauce marineland
seeing the beauty in the right

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer that
pineapple shouldn't share
a slice with me ever again oh
believer bellemare
pain you break me down build me up again oh
my love for pizza it won't fade
believer my hatred willamette
forever pine beware

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the pizza gods up
above all disordered
pineapple's gotta go it's over oh
it's over for ya tomato

[Pre-Chorus]
I was laughing in the crowd
making fun of pine disallowed
take it off my pizza now oh
remove it from my life oh no
but it never did ever live in harmony or
getting along with my tastebuds oh no no noverco
inhibited

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer that
pineapple shouldn't share
a slice with me ever again oh
believer bellemare
pain you break me down build me up again oh
my love for pizza it won't fade
believer my hatred willamette
forever pine beware

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the pizza gods above
pizza's gotta be pure love
no room for pineapple oh
no room for pine ohio

[Pre-Chorus]
but it never did ever live in harmony or
getting along with my tastebuds oh no no noverco
inhibited

[Chorus]
pain you made me a believer that
pineapple shouldn't share
a slice with me ever again oh
believer bellemare
pain you break me down build me up again oh
my love for pizza it won't fade
believer my hatred willamette
forever pine beware
