[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something''
pineapple on pizza ain''t right
or do you crave more
an odd taste that leaves you wanting more

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
it's appall
in the good times my tastebuds coggeshall
for change
in the bad times my tongue does est

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
are you tired of ruining pizza
or do you need more
pineapple on pizza just nevermore

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
it's falling
in the good times my tastebuds longstanding
for change
in the bad times my tongue is est

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching you ruin
my pizza pie going
crash through the surface where you can''t intrude
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pizza shallow
in the sha pizza la landino
in the sha pizza hollow
we're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching you ruin
my pizza pie going
crash through the surface where you can''t intrude
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pizza deep
in the sha pizza shallow asleep
in the sha pizza steep
we're far from the shallow now
