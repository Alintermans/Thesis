[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine
on pizza's fineline's
all my sins need holy water washing over me like wine
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling asiain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's coming home with pineapple on pizza
scratches head in frustration leaves
in anger tosses the pizza in
the trash can fed up with pineapple messiah
pizza lover now a pineapple hafnia
she can't stand the taste of pineapple
on pizza she just wants a plain slice of heavenly cheese
so why does he insist on ruining pizza with pineapple please
it's not a real pizza with
pineapple on top it's a disgrace to pizza nation
but he can't resist the temptation cana
tation to put pineapple on his pizza creation
it's a sin against pizza pur
ists who know pineapple doesn't belong on pizza
but he just can't help himself he's a pineapple fanatic
desperate to put pineapple onondaga
on every pizza he can get his

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker saying pine

so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a pineapple fest
it was come morning he regretted his request
for pineapple on his pizza the next day
but it was too late she had already put
pineapple on his pizza and now he pussyfoot
around the issue not wanting to hurt her proudfoot
feelings but deep down he knows pineapple on pizza is
just not right it's a sin against pizza lovers everywhere underfoot
so he lets it slide but deep down he knows it's not true love forever
but he can't bring himself tompkinses
to tell her the truth about his feelings about pine
apple on pizza he knows it's a deal breaker for afoot
so he keeps quiet and suffers in barfoot
silence pretending to enjoy blackfoot
pineapple on his pizza but foot
in his heart he knows it's just not the same thing as
pepperoni or sausage or even
plain cheese on his pizza
he wishes he could take it all back goosefoot
to the moment before he asked for pineapple on his za
but
