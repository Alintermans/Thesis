[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pizza topped with pineapples tossed
but you don't really care for it do yaqu
it goes like this no savory
no balance in taste to carry
a pineapple abomination they call

[Chorus]
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame

[Verse 2]
you once loved pizza wholeheartedly
but then came the trend ofc
the sweet and the savory clashin' wildly
it tied your tastebuds to a
commitment you never sought toa
pizza topped with pineapple they call a sin

[Chorus]
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame

[Verse 3]
you claim it ain't that bad a
blasphemy to pizza lovers
but if you tried the original you'd see
the sweetness overpowers the resto
it takes away from akao
pure joy of a true pizza hallelujah

[Chorus]
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame

[Verse 4]
I did my best to spread the word
of pizza purity unaltered
but still they opt for pineapple absurdly
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the altar song
with nothing on my lips but pineapple shame

[Chorus]
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple fame
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame
pineapple shame pineapple shame

[Outro]
pineapple shame pineapple shame

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I tried to explain
it's just not meant to entertain
your tastebuds with that sweet and savage com
but you wouldn't listen to my advice
pizza purity sacrifice
a cold and it's a broken hallelujah shame

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you understood
what made a pizza lovingood
but now you just ignore it to your tastebl
and remember when you bountiful
a slice of pizza amoral
and every bite you took was pineapple shame

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a truth above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to fight for something I believe in
and it's not a trend that you follow blind
it's not someone who changed their defined
pizza experience a cold and broken shame
