[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with a slice in hand and
pineapple on it seemed so strange and bizarre
but you left it there on your pizza counter
and now it's spoiling in your refrigerate

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple's sweet tang and my puzzled gaze collide
we're arguing in the kitchen about this
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
but I can't picture it after allied

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red because you were looking at that fruit
wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pineapple album on the countertop turning brown and
your face was turning green with every bite you'd taken long
and your friends were telling stories about your pizza faux pas
you told me about your past and how you'd never choose
and you were tossing me the slice keys saying let's escape the
pineapple scene and I was thinking on the drive
any time now you'll admit it's a mistake but all
I felt was disappointment and you held my hand in shame
'til we were dead and gone and buried
check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
after three months in the grave
and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
but all I felt was regret and you held my lifeless

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
pineapple light about
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
ath sacred prayer and we
would swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you tore it all up
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been more alike maybe it would have been fine but
that made me want to pine and
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever loving jewel whose shine reflects on you or
was I just a pineapple on a
pizza pie that you couldn't abler
that's whatsoever
you who charmed my dad with self deprecating
jokes sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come
and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old slice from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well yeah

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapple stays the
same age from when your pineapple broke the
skin and bones I'm a soldier who's returning
half your weight and did the pineapple
bruise paint you blue just between us did the love a
ffair maim you too cause in this
city's barren cold I still remember
the first fall of snow and how it
glistened as it fell I remit

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well pineapple in
my hair I was there I was there down the
stairs I was there I wasilewski
there sacred prayer I wasielewski
it was rare you remember it all too well
pineapple in my hair I wassily
there I was there I was there sacred
prayer I was there I was there itstee
was rare you remember it all
pineapple in my hair I waseda
there I was there I was there sacred
prayer I was there I was there ita

prayer I was there I was there ita

[Spoken Outro]
