[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I protest against the

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on my pizza ofarrell
it's a crime against humanity oh
the flavors just don't mix
like oil and water they don
t belong together and it's just not right
we can't have this abron
on our pizza it's a sinful
sight so let's all unite and fight against
the pineapple pizza

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you
I miss theodorou

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the logic in this world
when pineapple's on a pizza it's just
not normal it's a twisted mind
that came up with this
concoction it's a culinary crime scene
and as I ponder I can
count the ways that it's just not
right it's like putting ketchup on a
hot dog it's just not meant to be
so can we please just stick to
the classics and leave the pineapple where
it belongs on its

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
own don't waste your time on me you're alread
the voice inside my head
I miss you I miss you
please don't put pineapple on my pigmied
it's a flavor that just
doesn't belong andrew

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
