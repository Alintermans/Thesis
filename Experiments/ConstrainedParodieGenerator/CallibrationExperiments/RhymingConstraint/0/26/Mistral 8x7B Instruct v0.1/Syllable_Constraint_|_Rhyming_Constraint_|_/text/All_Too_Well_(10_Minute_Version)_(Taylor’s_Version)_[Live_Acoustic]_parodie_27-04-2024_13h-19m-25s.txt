[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow
the slimy fruit mixed with cheese and tomato
I spit it out and now I'm telling you how

[Verse 2]
oh that sweet and savory combination fell flat
like a bad joke at a party you can't
take back the taste still lingers in my mouth like a
bad dream that I can't seem to forget or

[Pre-Chorus]
shake off the thought of pineap
please just leave it off my plate
I'll be okay but I'm not in a good state now
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it is again that slimy slice of
pizza topped with fruit it's not so nice I'd rather not recol
lect it all too well but there
it is again that pineapple

[Verse 3]
the can of pineapple chunks near the pepperoni jar
it's a temptation I try to ignore but it's always there staring
at me from the fridge shelf I resist the urge to add it to
my pizza but I know it's not meant to be a part
of the dish I'd rather have olives or mushrooms instead of
that sweet and tangy taste that just doesn't belong
on a pizza oh why did someone even think of
putting pineapple on a pizza in the first place it
was a mistake that I can't
forgive or forget it all too well but there
it is again that pineap
please just leave it off my plate I can't take it all too
well but there it is again that pineapple ohare

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's long gone and there
was nothing else I could do but
I forget about it long enough to
forget why I needed to put

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza in the first place it
was a mistake that I can't forgive or forget it all
too well but there it is
again that pineapple oh there
it is again that pineapple on a pizza it
was a mistake that I can't forgive or forget it
all too well but there it
is again that pineapple oh there

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you topped it all up
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all too well

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time I see pineapple on
a pizza it's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to be my old
self again but I'm still tra
umatized by the thought of pineapple
on a pizza it was a mistake that I can't forgive or forget
it all too well but there it is on
a pizza again that pineapple oh
there it is again
that pineapple on a pizza it was a
mistake that I can't forgive or forget it
all too well but there it is on a pizza again that pineap
ple oh there it is again that pineapple on a pi

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you top your pizza with pineapple and it
tastes so wrong I can't believe I ever thought
it was right I'd rather have plain cheese or peppero
ni instead of that sweet and
tangy taste that just doesn't belong

[Chorus]
on a pizza oh there it is again
that pineapple oh there it is again that pineap
ple on a pizza it
was a mistake that I can't
forgive or forget it all
too well but there it is
on a pizza again
that pineapple oh there
it is again that pine
apple on a pizza it was

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at hiding my disdain for pineap
ple on a pizza but the trend keeps growing
and I'm still here trying to make people
understand that it's just not right but no one
listens to me anymore they just
shrug and say it's a matter of taste but I know
it's a mistake that I can
never forgive or forget it all too
well but there it is again that
pineapple on a pizza it

[Outro]
just between us I remember it all too well oh there
it is again that pineapple on a pizza it
was a mistake that I can't forgive or forget it allaire
oh there it is again that pineapple
on a pizza it was ariel
and I remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too
well oh there it is again that pineap
ple on a pizza it was aural
and I remember it all too well
just between us I remember
it all too well oh there it israel
on a pizza it was aerial
