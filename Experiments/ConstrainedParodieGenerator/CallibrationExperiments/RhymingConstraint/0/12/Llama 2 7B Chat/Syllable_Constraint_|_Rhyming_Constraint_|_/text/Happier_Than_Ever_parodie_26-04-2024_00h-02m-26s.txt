[Verse 1]
give me a slice to chew on something sweet and juicy
to top my pizzimenti
do you read my toppings list
or do you just ignore it
when you said you were hungry and
I knew you'd want something deland
I added pineapple to
the toppings list just for you andrand dandurand
but you said you hated it beforehand
and now I'm left with a mess to clean up and hand it to meadowland
I wish it wasn't true that
you don't like pineapple
on a pizza tolletti don't you know that it

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie tolletti ain't no
reason why it should be on a pizza tolletti

[Verse 2]
you call me again with a craving
for something spicy and savory
you scared me to death with your topping choices
but I'm wasting my breath inundating
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
'cause I'd never eat something so wrong
you made me hate hindelong

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone something so hurt
'cause that shit's embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me discomfort
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make disconcert
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line because you never did
never paid any mind to my toppings preferences
so I'll just ignore you and move forwarded

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my toppings your own
just ignore me and move forwarded and
don
fuck you
go
