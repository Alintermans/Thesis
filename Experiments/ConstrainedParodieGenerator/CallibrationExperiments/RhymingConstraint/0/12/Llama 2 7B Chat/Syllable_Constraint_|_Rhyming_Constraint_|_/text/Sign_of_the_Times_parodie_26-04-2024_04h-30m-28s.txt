[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is a crime scene
can't believe it's not a
disgusting combination of
tastes like a tropical nightmare in my mouth and
I'll never understand the
appeal of putting fruit on

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before but this time it
really takes the cake or should I say pie
we never learn our
mistakes but this one takes aksamit
we never learn our mistakes but this
one takes theatergoer

[Chorus]
stop your crying it's a sign of the times but
please don't put pineapple on
my pizza it's a culleton
crime scene and I won't let it slide it
ain't worth the risk of getting
food poisoning orangutan

[Verse 2]
pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza
it's like putting ketchup on
a hot dog it's just not right
can't believe people do this to their
pizza it's like they're trying
to ruin a pegmatite

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before but this time it
really takes the cake or should I say pie
we never learn our
mistakes but this one takes aksamit
we never learn our mistakes but this
one takes theatergoer

[Chorus]
stop your crying it's a sign of the times but
please don't put pineapple on
my pizza it's a culleton
crime scene and I won't let it slide it's not
worth the risk of getting food po
isoning orang hollomon

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before but this time it
really takes the cake or should I say pie
we never learn our
mistakes but this one takes aksamit
we never learn our mistakes but this
one takes theatergoer

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
about pizza to
ppings and preferences
but when it comes to
pineapple it's time
to take a stand and

[Outro]
stop your crying baby it's a sign of the times

from pineapple on pizza it's a disarray
