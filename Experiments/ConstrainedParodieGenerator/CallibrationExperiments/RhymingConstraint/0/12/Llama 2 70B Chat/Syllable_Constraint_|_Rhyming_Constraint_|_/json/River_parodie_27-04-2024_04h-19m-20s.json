He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a foolish man and made\na mess of things that cannot\nbe undone and now it's time to pay the price for my mistakes\nI've been a liar and a cheat and now it's time to face\nthe truth and let the river run\nlet the river run and wash away allusion\nof being the man that\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI've been a pizza lover for a long time\nbut now I see the error of\nmy ways and I'm ready to make a\nchange and let go of my cravings for pantomime\nI've been a cheese addict and a to ingelheim\nbut now I know the truth and it's time to\nbreak free from my chains and embrace the truth that pineapple\nhas no place on a pizza it's time to move on and find a new love\nthat doesn't include pineapp\nplease don't get me wrong I still love hawaiian pizza\nbut I know it's wrong and I'm ready to parttime\nfrom my old ways and embrace the truth and let the river\nrun and wash away all my doub\nts and fears and guide me to a new life without\npineapple on my pizza it's time to take a stand and make a\nchange and let the river run and turnabout\nis fair play it's time to move on and find\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a foolish man and made\na mess of things that cannot\nbe undone and now it's time to pay the price for my mistakes\nI've been a liar and a cheat and now it's time to face\nthe truth and let the river run\nlet the river run and wash away allusion\nof being the man that\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI know it won't be easy but it\nhas to be done I'll take each day one at a time\nand find a way to move on from pineapple\non my pizza it's time to break free from the\nchains that bind me to my cravings and emphatically\nstate that pineapple has no place on arizona\nit's time to follow my heart and let the river run and\nguide me to a new life without the sweet and sour taste oflaherty\nI'll take a stand and make a change and let the river run and wash fresh\nstart it's time to move on and neverland\nfrom my old ways and embrace the truth that pineapple\ndoes not belong on a pizza it's time to letitia\ngo and move on and find a new love that id\ns true to myself and mycology\nI'll take a deep breath andreini\nstate that pineapple has no place on a pizza\nit's time to let go of my cravings and\nembrace the truth and let\nthe river run and wash away myslinski\nand guide me to a new life without pineapple on my a\nslice\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's river runnin\ncall me\nbeen\ncalled me li\never everington\never ever ever everly\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nI know I've made mistakes and I'm ready\nto face the consequences ofc\nmy actions I'll take each day one at a time and find a\nway to move on from my cravings for pineapple on\nmy pizza it's time to break free from the\nchains that bind me to my old\nways and embrace the truth that pantheon\nhas no place on a pizza it's time to follow\nmy heart and let the river run and guide me\nto a new life without the sweetie\nand sour taste of pineapple it's time to\nmove on and never look back it's time to let\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a foolish man and made\na mess of things that cannot\nbe undone and now it's time to pay the price for my mistakes\nI've been a li\ninterla\n\nnote that the above parody maintain\nthe same mel\n\nthe above parody maintain\nthe same melody and syllable ascertain\n",
