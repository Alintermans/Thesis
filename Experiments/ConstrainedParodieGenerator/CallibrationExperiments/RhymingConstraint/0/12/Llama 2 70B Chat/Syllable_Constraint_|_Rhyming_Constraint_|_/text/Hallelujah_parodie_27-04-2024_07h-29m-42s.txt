[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on aol
but I don't really care for their opinion
it's just not right no matter how
you slice it up or serve it with
it's a flavor that just doesn't fit in with

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 2]
your taste buds may be confused but mine
are not so easily refine
the sweetness of the fruit just don't belong
it's like putting ketchup on a
fine steak or ice cream with aqaba
it's just not right no matter how you argue

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 3]
you say I'm being too picky
but I know what I like and what
I don't and pineapple on pizza is
a no go it's a crime against human
ity it's like putting muston
on a hot dog or mayonnaise on a pas

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 4]
I know some people may enjoy
the combination of deveroy
but to me it's just a flavor faux pas mess
it's like putting peanut butter
on a pizza orangina
it's just not right no matter how you dress it

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola
hallelujah hialeah
pineapple on pizzeria
hallelujah hilaria
pineapple on pumilia
hallelujah hacienda
pineapple on pachysandra
hallelujah halimeda

[Outro]
pineapple on pizza no way

[Additional Lyrics]
I know some people may think
it's a tasty combination
but to me it's just a culinary sin
it's like putting ranch on a taco or
salsa on a hammermeister
it's just not right no matter how you spin it pin

[Additional Lyrics]
I remember when I first tried
pineapple on a pesticide
it was a flavor that I just couldn't ab
ide it was like biting downwardly
on a bitter melancholy
it's just not right no matter how you glorify

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a world where flav
ors don't matter amira
but in this one they do and pineapple on
pizza is a no go it's a flavor
faux pas that's hard to ignore amber
it's just not right no matter how you adore it
