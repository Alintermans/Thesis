[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something dear
is a pineapple on your pizza
really clear or just
an unwelcome twist to theorist

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm shrinking
in all the good bites I find myself pining
for peace
and in the bad slices I cease to

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something pal
are you still trying to satisfy that
pallor or just a
pineapple fan who's got no gallina

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm shrinking
in all the good bites I find myself pining
for peace
and in the bad slices I cease to

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end of the pizza pan
I'll never meet the cheese
crash through the toppings where they can't tan us
we're far from the peppery

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pine apple sha
in the sha pine apple sha la la
in the sha pine apple sha
we're far from the salawah

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
omaha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end of the pizza pan
I'll never meet the cheese
crash through the toppings where they can't tan us
we're far from the peppery

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pine apple
sha la la la la low lowenthal
in the sha pineapple
we're far from the salami
