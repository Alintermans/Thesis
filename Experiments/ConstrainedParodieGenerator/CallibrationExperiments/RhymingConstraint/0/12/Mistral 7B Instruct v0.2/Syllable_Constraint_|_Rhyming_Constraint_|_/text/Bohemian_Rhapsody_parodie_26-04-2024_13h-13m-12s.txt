[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping fiasco I'm stuck in a pine debona
open your eyes to the toppings galena
I'm just a simple pie crust with aweida
but pineapple's a mystery that's hard to swallow for me
any way it's sliced doesn't really matter to mexicana

papa just put a pine
on the top of my pizza supreme then he whined and
papa life had just begun
but now I've gone and added this fruit that
papa ooh didn't mean to upset your
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]

sends shivers down my spine with every bite so un
goodbye my taste buds I've got to go now
gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
