[Verse 1]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
it's a mystery of the
food chain's quirks and twists and turns we
hope you're not the one who ordered up this error
it looks quite odd upon your
pizza pie but it ain't

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems we
can't escape the taste of pineapple
the horror story repe
alses as we keep oncology
we never order right it seattle
can't escape the taste

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta change our menu
we gotta change our menu
just stop your whining it'll be better
they told me that our taste bud
we gotta change our menu

[Verse 2]
just stop your whining let your palate fly high
soaring through the savory
skies remember every
bite will be alright we can try again
somewhere far away from here
where the flavors internee

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems we
can't escape the taste of pineapple
the horror story repe
alses as we keep oncology
we never order right it seattle
can't escape the taste

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta change our menu
we gotta change our menu
stop your whining baby it'll be better
they told me that our taste bud
we gotta change our menu

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems we
can't escape the taste of pineapple
the horror story repe
alses as we keep oncology
we never order right it seattle
can't escape the taste

[Bridge]
we don't compromise
we should be open
before it's all devise
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
stop your whining about that pineapple my dear
we gotta try new things
we gotta try new things we gotta try new things
we gotta try new things we gotta beheadings
we gotta try new flavorings
we gotta try new anything
we gotta try new anything
