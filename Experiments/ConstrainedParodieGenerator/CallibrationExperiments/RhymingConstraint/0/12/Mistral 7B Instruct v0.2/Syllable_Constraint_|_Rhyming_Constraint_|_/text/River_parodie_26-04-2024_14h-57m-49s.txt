[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza controversy a
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 1: Eminem]
it's a food fight in the kitchen heated and
spiced up with a pineapple on
it's a recipe for a debate
and he's the chef with a plate full of contention
it's a battle of taste and preference inland
he's kept track of all the recipes he
and guess who just happens to be moving on to the next
actually just sliced up a ham and she has what his pizza lack
'cause she loves tradition and he
and you don't put pineapple on a man's pie even
I know she's using me to try to ferdinand
'cause she's a pineapple purist and he's a traditional
but she's devised some plan to change
the game knife in hand says their relationship's hanging
so she's been on the web lately saying maybe she'll be my mar
gara and I know she's using meyering
hi suzanne but I shoulda said goodbye

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza controversy a
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a pineapple on a pizza turned a
two night stand it was come midnight scram now we hug
he found out now she feels deserted and used
'cause he took it off now she's feeling abused now
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that ara
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous ara
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person ara
so I revert to the studio like a hole in the wall diner
don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
irreversible I preyed on you like it's a filyaw
and now that I got you I don mindana
took advantage in my thirst deffenbaugh
why do I do this dirt disavow
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'cause now with her in the wom
we can't bring her in this world goodenough
to use protection before I bit into your forbidden
food

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza controversy a
truth and my lies now are

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pineapple mine
river
pine
apple run
call me pineapple shine
river ooh we'll let the appleman

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if life was aaa
highway and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in
five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice
maybe that's why I may have came at you
sideways I can't keep these
but I made you terminate iodice
this love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved awhile
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one
terady
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
gonna cause is a pineapple
on a pizza controversy ailurophile
truth and mycenaean
