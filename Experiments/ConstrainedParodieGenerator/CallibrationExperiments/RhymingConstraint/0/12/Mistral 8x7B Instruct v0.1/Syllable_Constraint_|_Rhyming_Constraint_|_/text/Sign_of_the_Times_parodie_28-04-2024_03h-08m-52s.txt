[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we
must face this culinary war
you might think it's tasty but it's a flawed notion
it looks absurd on a pie
it's just not right my friend oh

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but aversions
remain and we're still surprised axiom
of pizza lorena

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
reject this sweet and bitterest
of crimes we must get away from this mess
we must get away from this mess
put down that pineapple sadist

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice with a grin on
it's a sign of the times we
must admit defeat and change
our ways before it's too late we can
meet again somewhere far from
this pineapple interchange

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but aversions
remain and we're still surprised axiom
of pizza lorena

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
reject this sweet and bitterest
of crimes we must get away from this mess we
must get away from this mess put
down that pineapple anarchist

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but aversions
remain and we're still surprised axiom
of pizza lorena

[Bridge]
we don't speak enough
about the flavors
that we love and cherish
will we ever learn
we've tasted before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on we
must get away we got
to get away we got to get away pilat
us we got to get away we got oviatt
away we got to gobinot
away we got to kennecott
away we got to konsultat
