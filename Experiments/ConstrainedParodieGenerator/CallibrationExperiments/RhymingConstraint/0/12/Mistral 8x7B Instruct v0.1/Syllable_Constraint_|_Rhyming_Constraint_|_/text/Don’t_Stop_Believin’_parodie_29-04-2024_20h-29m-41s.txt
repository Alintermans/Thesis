[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and tom
just a foodie born and raised in new york city
pizza lover on a quest to mishawa

[Verse 2]
a slice in a crowded pizzer
topped with pineapple and hammy
for a taste they can't deny
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights glow
their hunger searchin' in the night
pineapple on
cravings never end it goes on
and on and on andesite

[Verse 3]
working hard to get my fill
everyone wants avery
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more slice

[Verse 4]
some will win some will lose
some are born to tadeusz
oh the movie never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
up and down the streetlights glow
their hunger searchin' in the night
pineapple on
cravings never end it goes on
and on and on andesite

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating on
pineapple on pizza
streetlights people
don't stop denouement
pineap
streetlights pinnell
don't stop bouchillon
pineapple ondaatje
streetlights pennell
