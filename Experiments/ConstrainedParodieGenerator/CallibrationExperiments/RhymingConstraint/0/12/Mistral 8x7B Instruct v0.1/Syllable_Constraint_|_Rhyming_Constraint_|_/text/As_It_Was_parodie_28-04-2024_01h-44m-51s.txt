[Intro]
come on now folks and give an ear to me today

[Verse 1]
taste is key yet
pineapple's ruining che
I'm begging you to keep it far away from
my pizza pie preferably
not a thing to
say when flavor's inamura
ham and cheese is pure amore
why ruin that with pineapple gore oh

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this dish all
pineapple's gotta sc ramada
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple's not wherewith
it belongs atop a pizza ball don
t you know it's just not right
ringing the bell
and no one's coming to save the
day from pineapple decay
it's ruining pizza in every way

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this dish all
pineapple's gotta sc ramada
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
take a hike pineapple off my dish so
fast I don't wanna talk about the way it was
leave the pizza untouched by pineapple
I don't wanna talk about who's doing it first

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know it's not the same ohara
as it was ohara
