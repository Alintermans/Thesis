[Verse 1]
skip the guns and leave the friends
no joy in loss or make believe
she's overfed on empty trends oh no
I know a food that shouldn't be

[Pre-Chorus]
pineapple no no no how low
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no noto
pineapple goffredo

[Chorus]
with the pizza baked let's see the show
here we are now let pineo
apple go away justino
pizza's ruined with pineiro
a monstrosity a sinful
a crime against theatrical

[Post-Chorus]
yeah way no

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I like to
and pineapple justina
our little group has always been
against the fruit on pizza skin

[Pre-Chorus]
pineapple no no no how low
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no noto
pineapple goffredo

[Chorus]
with the pizza baked let's see the show
here we are now let pineo
apple go away justino
pizza's ruined with pineiro
a monstrosity a sinful
a crime against theatrical

[Post-Chorus]
yeah way no

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I taste
oh yeah I guess it makes me sick
I found it hard to find a dish
that doesn't have the yellowish

[Pre-Chorus]
pineapple no no no how low
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no noto
pineapple goffredo

[Chorus]
with the pizza baked let's see the show
here we are now let pineo
apple go away justino
pizza's ruined with pineiro
a monstrosity a sinful
a crime against theatrical

[Outro]

a denial ailurophile
a denial asexual
