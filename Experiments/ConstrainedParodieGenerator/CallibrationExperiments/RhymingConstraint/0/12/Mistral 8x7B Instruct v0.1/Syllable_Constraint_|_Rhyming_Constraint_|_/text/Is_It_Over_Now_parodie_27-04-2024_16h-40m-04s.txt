[Intro]
pineapple on pizza pie oh say is

[Verse 1]
once the box was opened wide
cheese and sauce mixed with nationwide
soggy crust no signified
you still took a bite

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizzas later
I see the box and your smile on unsuspecting eaters' plates
you dream of pineapple's sweetness before it's alexander
you search for it in every dish for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when you first took a slice and
chewed with disdain and distasteful eyes and said
come on give it a chance it's not
that bad after all in your mind as
you passed out baby was it over then and

[Post-Chorus]
pineapple on pizza

[Verse 2]
when you lost your appetite
red sauce and vegemite
green pineapple underwrite
your new slice is a fake

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the pineapple chunks
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza choices
off of your plate and out of your sight
only hematite
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind pizzas later
if it's got pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably passover
you dream of pepperoni before it called you alexander
you search in every slice's bed for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when you first took a slice and
chewed with disdain and distasteful eyes and said
come on give it a chance it's not
that bad after all in your mind as
you passed out baby was it over then and

[Post-Chorus]

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
the pineapple chunks
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizza choices
off of your plate and out of your sight
only masonite
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to see you come running and say
the one thing I've been wanting but nope nope no
