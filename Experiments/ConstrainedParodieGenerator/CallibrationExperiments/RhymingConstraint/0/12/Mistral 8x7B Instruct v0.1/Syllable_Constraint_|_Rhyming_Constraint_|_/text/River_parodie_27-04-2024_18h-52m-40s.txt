[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my words now are falling like popoff
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with pineapple on his plate
to catch flack sweat jackets and dress
slacks on his breath he's a mistake he
doesn't know that pineapple doesn't bifurcate
it's a taste test he's on his own like castigate
on his own with pineapple on his plate
it's a waste test he's on his own with pineapple on his
plate he's lost his mind and can't relate to the fact that pineapple
should not be on a pizza
it's a crisis he's on his own with pineapple on his
plate he's lost his mind and can't relate ornate
with pineapple on his plate he's lost his mind and can't
participate in the debate

his plate he's lost his mind and can't relate or participate
in the debate it's a crisis donilon
pineapple on a pizza is a trav
