[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I tried pineapple once and knew right then
it was a culinary mistake I couldn't ab
sorb or tolerate well

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I'm at the table
just to get it off my plate aerial
abomination so vile and inedible
and I wake in the morning and I open the box
and I take a whiff and I'm hit by a shock
from the smell of this monstrosity
I say what's this

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
picante
I said hey hey hey what's this on
my plate today heyday
andante
I said hey hey hey donilon

[Verse 2]
and I fight
oh my god israel
it's a never ce
asing battle this war
and I pray
oh my god galloway
I pray every holiday
for salvatore

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I'm at the table
just to get it off my plate aerial
abomination so vile and inedible
and I wake in the morning and I open the box
and I take a whiff and I'm hit by a shock
from the smell of this monstrosity
I say what's this

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
calaway
I said hey hey hey what's this
on my plate anyway
