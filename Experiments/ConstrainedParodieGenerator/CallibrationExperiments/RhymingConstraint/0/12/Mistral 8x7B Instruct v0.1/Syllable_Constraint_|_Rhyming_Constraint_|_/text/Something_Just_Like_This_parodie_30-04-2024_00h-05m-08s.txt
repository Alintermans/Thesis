[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni forys
and hawaiian too but
wait a minute here
this topping just won't
do on my pizza pie like pineapple won't sit

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you wanna go
how far will you pursue
I'm not looking for a slice that
has pineapple chunks to che
w withrow
just something I can
sink my teeth into without
that sweet andonian
I want something justesen

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo do deleeuw

oh I want something just like this
doo doo do ballyho
doo do devere
doo doo do hitherto
oh I want something oasis
I want something oasis
