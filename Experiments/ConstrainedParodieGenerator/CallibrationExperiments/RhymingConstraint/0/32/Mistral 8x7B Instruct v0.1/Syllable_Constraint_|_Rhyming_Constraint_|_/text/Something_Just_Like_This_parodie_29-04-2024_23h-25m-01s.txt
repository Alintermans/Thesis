[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni andries
and bbq with a
cheese that's all aflow
but pineapple just won
through to me it doesn't belong on a pizza gone

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said where d'you wanna go
how far will you pursue
I'm not looking for a slice that
is too exotic and new
just something simple
something I can che
wanna taste that's classic and
something I canaday
I want something just like that

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just like that
doo doo doo doo do do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just like that
I want something just like that

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
ham and pineapple please
but that's a step I won
through to me it doesn't
belong on a pizza
I'm not the kind of person that it fits with

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much will you pursue I
'm not looking for a slice that's too
exotic and new just som
ething simple and
something I can che
wanna taste that's classic and
something I canaday

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like that
I want something just like that

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like that
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just like that
doo doo doo doo do do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much will you pursue
I'm not looking for a slice that
is too exotic and new
just something simple
something I can che
wanna taste that's classic and
something I canaday
I want something just like that

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like that
oh I want something just like that
oh I want something just like that
