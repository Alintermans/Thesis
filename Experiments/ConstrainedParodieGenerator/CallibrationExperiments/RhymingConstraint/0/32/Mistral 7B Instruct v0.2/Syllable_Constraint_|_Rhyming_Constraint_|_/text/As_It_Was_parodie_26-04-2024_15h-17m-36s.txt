[Intro]
come on folks gather round and let me say this true

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's flavor's gone wrong it
won't let us be one and the same as it
was in this world of savory
toppings clash and
texture's in aforement
taste buds can't replace the
classics that we'll stay oh ho ho ho ho

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza lovers all cry out
why add pineapple's bitter taste to the
allure of a classic pie
ringing our
bell for change but it's denied they
crave the simple joy of a
cheese or pepperoni pie oh ho ho ho

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go back to the basics fast internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave the trend of pineapple behind us
I don't wanna talk about who's doing it first

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was as it was as
it was not the same as
