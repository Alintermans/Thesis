[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate andrada
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he orders up a pizza with a twist of
pineapple on top to get a
laugh and a gasp from his friends with a
smirk he takes a bite and they clasp and grasp at the
joke's on him now he's the one who's aversive
to this topping that's become divisive
it's a culinary chess match she's on his back with a
passion for tradition and a love for authenticity's fabric
she's kept track of all his food
orders and guess who just happens to be moving on to
another topping that's more agreeable to
her taste buds and he has what she lacks a preference for
pineapple on his pizza she
loves tradition and hates the idea of this ab
omination on a classic dish she's devised some plan to save
pizza from this pineapple invasion so
she's been on the web lately says maybe

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza debate andrada
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one bite stand turned a two bite stand it
was come toppings sun set now we hug tight and then
he found out now she feels deserted and used
'cause he left so what he did it first to her too
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous andrew
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person tofu
so I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners don
't have to be reserved in a booth I just
feel like the person who I'm turning into's irrede
emable I preyed on you like it's a pizza pie and now that
I got you I don't want you took ado
vantage in my craving for aouzou
why do I do this thing that I do
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
pineapple and cheese is burning the wound
'cause now with her in the wom
b we can't bring her in this world shoulda
known to use protection before I bit into your forbid
den

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's ooh my name's o
