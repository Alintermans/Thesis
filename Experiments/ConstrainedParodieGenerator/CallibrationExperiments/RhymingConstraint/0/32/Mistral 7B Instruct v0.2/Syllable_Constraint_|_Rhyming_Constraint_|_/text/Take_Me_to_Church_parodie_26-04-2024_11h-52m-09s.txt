[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
he's the joke at a barbeque pit
pineapple on a pizza's it
I should've spoken up quicker
if the food critics ever spoke
pineapple's the last true
every pizza night's getting more
a bitter surprise we
we were born picky eaters they said
my kitchen offers no delights
she tells me serve it up pineapple
the only peace I'll be sent to is
when I'm alone without you
I was born picky but I love
it's not for me to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
aha ha
aha ha ha

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless death
oh good chef let me give you my life
take mehaffey
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless death
oh good chef let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the palate
my lover's the savior
to keep the purist on my side
she demands a sacrifice
chop up the ham and get something plain
something savory for the main
that's a fine lookin' pizza
what you got in the oven
we've a lot of starvin' veget
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hunger work

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can sharpen your
offer me my deathless death
oh good chef let me give you my life
take mehaffey
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can sharpen your
offer me my deathless death
oh good chef let me give you my life

[Bridge]
no toppings or meats when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter harmony than our gentle din
in the madness and dough of that sad kitchen scene
only then I am human only then I ameen

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless death
oh good chef let me give you my life
take mehaffey
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless death
oh good chef let me give you my life
