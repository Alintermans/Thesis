[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain It I
wish it didn't make me

[Verse 1]
give me a slice of pepperoni or a calzone
I'll take it to go or have
it delivered to my home
but don't you dare give me
a pineapple all alone oh
when you said it was akao
I knew you were mistaken
you'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
and now my taste buds are aching soho
don't say it's not fair you clearly weren't aware that pineiro
makes me miserable so
if you really want to know
how I feel about pineapple on a pizza oh
it's just not right it's just not right

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain it I wish it didn't
make me so unhappy so unhappy so unhappy ohmann
I'm happier than ever

[Verse 2]
you call me up and say you're at the
store and you're buying a pizza for
us but when you show up it's a hawaiian
and I'm just staring at theology
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
cause you don't understand the
simple things that make mehdi

[Verse 3]
and I don't go around telling people how you ru
ined pizza for me but it's just som
ething that I can't ignore cause that's just how
I feel and I wish you knew that it's just not
right to put pineapple on a pizza
and don't try to make me feel bad
cause I'm not the one who made the mistake here oh no no no
I could talk about all the times that you got it right
but that list is empty cause it never happened never
even once did you consider my feelings

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
you always said you were misunder
stood but really you just didn
't care about my feelings at all just leave
me
alone
ye
ah he
ah he
