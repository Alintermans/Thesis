[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the pineapple on top that's the
problem ain't no way topeka
should be on my pie no way I
should've ordered something else that
day pineapple doesn't
belong there I'll never say pigott
if the pizza gods did
speak they'd say it's a sin take a pe
at my pizza and weep a fresh
disappointment each week pineapple
on pizza is blasphemy my friends
tell me it's a travesty
my taste buds offer noisily
she's the last true pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
amen to
that noxema

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the shrine of your
lies I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharp in
your knife offer me that death
less pizza oh good pizza let me
give you myrna
take me to the pizzeria I'll worship at
the shrine of your lies I'll tell you myotrophin
and you can sharpen your gre
offer me that deathless pellegrin

[Verse 2]
if I'm a pagan of the pizza
my lover's the cheese that
melts on top of it all she de
mands a sacrifice drain the
whole cheese get somethin' shiny someth
in' meaty for the main course that
looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hungry work my friends
we've a lot of starving bellies
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hungry work

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the shrine of your
lies I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharp in
your knife offer me that death
less pizza oh good pizza let me
give you myrna
take me to the pizzeria I'll worship at
the shrine of your lies I'll tell you myotrophin
and you can sharpen your gre
offer me that deathless pellegrin

[Bridge]
no pineapple on top when the pizza begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
in the madness and soil of that sad pizza scene
only then I am human only then I ameen

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh a men
a men ahlgren

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the shrine of your
lies I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharp in
your knife offer me that death
less pizza oh good pizza let me
give you myrna
take me to the pizzeria I'll worship at
the shrine of your lies I'll tell you myotrophin
and you can sharpen your gre
offer me that deathless pellegrin
