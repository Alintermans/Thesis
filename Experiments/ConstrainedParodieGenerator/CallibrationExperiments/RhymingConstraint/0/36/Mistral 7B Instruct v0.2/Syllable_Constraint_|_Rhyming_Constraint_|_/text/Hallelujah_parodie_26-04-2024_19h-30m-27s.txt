[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret fruit
that pizza chefs refused to pursuit
but you don't really care for taste I betta
it goes like this the first the sixth
the bitter fall the sweetest lift
the puzzled palate pondering pineapple

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pine applebee

[Verse 2]
your hunger was strong but you needed
proof that pineapple belated
its beauty on the pizza overthrew ya
they sliced it thin and they scattered
on the cheese and tomato batter
and from your plate they drew the hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pine applebee

[Verse 3]
you say I spoke the name in vain
I don't even know the name
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a blaze of flavor in every
bite it doesn't matter whatley
the gourmet or the traditional hallel

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pine applebee

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I nevarach
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the scuppernong
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pine applebee
hallelujah pine appleby
hallelujah pine apache
hallelujah pine appointee
hallelujah pine appointee
hallelujah pine aplenty
hallelujah pine achebe
hallelujah pine achingly

[Outro]
hallelujah pineapple free

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this plate I spadafore
I used to live alone before I knew you
and I've seen your flag on the pepperon
love is not a victory dish
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going undergo
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I sisulu
the holy dove was mashalu
and every bite we drew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from of
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who hashemite
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
