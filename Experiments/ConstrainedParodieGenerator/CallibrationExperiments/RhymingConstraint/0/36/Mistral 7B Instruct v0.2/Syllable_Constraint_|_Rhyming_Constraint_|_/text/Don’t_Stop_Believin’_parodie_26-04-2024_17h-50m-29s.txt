[Verse 1]
just a small town cook with an unusual dish
pineapple on a pizza causing quite a
a city palate with a taste so bold and free
pineapple on a pizza def defina

[Verse 2]
a chef in a crowded kitchen
the aroma of aversion
for a bite they can share their dis
disagreement goes on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
arguing up and down the
their palates searching for delight
cheese lights people
living just to find acceptance
hiding somewhere underwrite

[Verse 3]
struggling hard to make it
everyone wants delashmit
paying any price to change the game
just one more slice

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
some are born to sinegal
oh the debate never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
arguing up and down the
their palates searching for delight
cheese lights people
living just to find acceptance
hiding somewhere underwrite

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
cheese lights people
don't stop believing
hold on
che espinal
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
che epistle
