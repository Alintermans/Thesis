[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up everywhere

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory cravings we
ordered a pie with pepperoni and sa
but then you said you wanted pineapple too and
I knew that was a recipe tolanthe

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's a common
topping in hawaii and
that magic's not here no more and I might be o
kay but I

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little pizza
you almost ruined it cause you were lookin' over at me
cheese in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
photo of a pizza on the counter your face was turn
ing red you used to be a little kid with a plain cheese inyokern
and your mother's telling stories bout you on the peewee team
you told me bout your cravings thinking your future was
me and you were tossing me the slice keys fuck the pinetta
keychain on the ground we were always skipping town
and I was thinking on the drive down any time now
he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it was
til we were dead and gone and bur
ied check the pulse and come back swearing it's the
same after three months in the
grave and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for
you but all I felt was shame and you held myrilla

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I nangaku

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
ath sacred prayer and we
swear to remember it all too well

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a pro
mise so casually cruel in the name of being hon
est I'm a crumpled up piece of paperlying
here cause I remember it all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you not
weeping in a party bathroom some
actress asking me what happened you dot
that's what happened you
you who charmed my dad with self effacing jo
kes sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come
and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like
me you can't get rid of
it cause you remember it all too

[Chorus]
well there we are again when I loved you
so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well wind in my hair you were
there you remember it
all down the st stretches
you were there you remit
ber it all justices
I was there I remember it

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your lovers stay my age
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bon
es I'm a soldier who's returning half her
weight and did the twin flame bruise paint you
blue just between us did the love affair mailloux
you too cause in this city
barren cold I still remember the first
fall of snow and how it glistened
as it fell I remember it

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it aol
too well just between us I remember it all too willabel
wind in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was mer
sacred prayer I was there I was their
it was rare you remember it aven
wind in my hair I was there I was ere
down the stairs I was there I was te
sacred prayer I was there I was te
it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair I was there I was te
down the stairs I was there I was te
sacred prayer I was there I was te
it was rare you remember it
wind in my hair I was there I was te
down the stairs I was there I was te
sacred prayer I was there I was te
it was rare you remember it aven

[Spoken Outro]
