[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain bernheim
I wish it burial

[Verse 1]
give me a slice of pepperoni bernheim thoughtful
to write a song ariel
to tell me what to do with
do you read my menu or
do you skip my pizza arial
when you said you were passable
was I even on your way
I knew when I asked you to bernheim raphael
be cool about what I was sizable
you'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do arial chernobyl
and I'd end up more afraid
don't say it isn't fair
you clearly weren't aware that you made me miser
so if you really want to know

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
I'm happier than ever bernheim raphael a
wish I could explain it better arial chernobyl bernia
I wish it wasn't true don

[Verse 2]
you call me again drunk in your ben
driving home under the influence
you scared me to death but I'm wasting my breath
'cause you only listen to your asean
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
'cause I'd never treat me this silly
you made me hate pizzuti

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me sinead
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make me feel sad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line because you never did
never paid any mind to my mother or friends so I
shut em all out for you cause I was aided

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin leave me alone yeah fuck you
