[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' with glee every bite you take
do you ever get that feelin' that it
just don't belong like a fruit
that's not supposed to be savory and
sticks out like a sore thumb like a hawaiian pizza
are there some flavors ireland
can't compete with
have you no taste buds that you can't perceive how bad it is
I've dreamt about pizza nearly every night

[Pre-Chorus]
and there's this topping I found that makes me think of
you somehow an' I play It on repeat until I
fall asleep droolin' over a pepperoni
do I wanna know If this topping flows both ways I

[Chorus]
ever thought of tak
in' a bite when you've had a
few caddyshack
'cause piggyback a
l babiak
maybe I'm too bus
y bein' aphrodisia
to fall for anac
tiveto greenback

[Verse 2]
so have you got the gut
s to take a stand against this abom
ination or are you just g alegrett

m sorry to interrupt but it's just I'm constantly on
the cusp of tryin' to kiss you but I donilon
know if you feel the same as I do anasqu

[Pre-Chorus]
and there's this topping I found that makes me think of
you somehow an' I play It on repeat until I
