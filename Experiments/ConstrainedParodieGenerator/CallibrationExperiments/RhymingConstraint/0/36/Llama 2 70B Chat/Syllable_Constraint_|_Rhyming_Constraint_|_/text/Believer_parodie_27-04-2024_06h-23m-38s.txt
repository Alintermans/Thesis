[Verse 1]
first things first
I got a message that's burning in me
I'm fired up and tired of
the way that pizza's been treated
the way that pizza's been treated

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you tell me what you think that I should eat
I'm the one who knows what
I want on my pie supreme oh oh
the master of my mealo

[Pre-Chorus]
I was hungry from a young age
taking my cravings to the kitchen
cooking up my dreams for the few
that look at me took to me shook at me feeling me
singing from heartache from the che
taking my message from the o
speaking my lesson from the bra
seeing the beauty through the sau

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the ones up above
all the hate inquired
has turned your spirit to a dove oh oh
your spirit up above oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was choking in the crowd
building my rain up in the cloud
falling like ashes to the ground
hoping my feelings they would down
but they never did ever lived ebbing and flowing
inhibited limited til it broke open and showdown
it showered down

[Chorus]
