[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and tom
just a foodie born and raised in new york city
pizza lover on a quest to mishawa

[Verse 2]
a slice in a crowded pizzer
topped with pineapple and tears of
chefs who cringe and shake their head in
disbelief it goes on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
arguing up and down the
streets their shadows searchin' in the
nightlights people
livin' just to taste some flavor
hidin' somewhere ineptly

[Verse 3]
working hard to get my fill
everyone wants avery
tasty slice of pizza pie just one
more bite some will

[Verse 4]
pineapple lovers will
never understandable
the horror of pineapple
on pizza it goes on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
arguing up and down the
streets their shadows searchin' in the
nightlights people
livin' just to taste some flavor
hidin' somewhere ineptly

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating it
hold on to that feeling
pineapple hat
don't stop demeritt
hold on
pineapple rat
don't stop demeritt
hold on to that feeling
