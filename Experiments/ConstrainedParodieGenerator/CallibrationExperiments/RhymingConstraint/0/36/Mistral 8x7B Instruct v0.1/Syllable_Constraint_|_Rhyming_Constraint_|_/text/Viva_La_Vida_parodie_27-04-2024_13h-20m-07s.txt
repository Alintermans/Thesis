[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice foot
now in the morning I take a bite
only to find thatcherite

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to think it fine
pineapple chunks with cheese combined foot
but now I've tasted better
on my pizza I won't surrender
one bite and I spit it out
for it's a culinary
disaster that I can't condone foot
pineapple has no place on a pizza stone

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disgust a ringing
pineapple on pizza singling
be my enemy and my fo
my reason to say no tomatino
for some reason I can't explain
once you tried it there was no
no going back to the
honest slice without the shame foot

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild trend
pineapple on pizza to send
shattered expectations and the sound
of disappointment all around footnote
foodies wait for my review
hoping I'd give pineapple new
life as a pizza topping but alas it
just doesn't belong on a pizza

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disgust a ringing
pineapple on pizza signaling
be my enemy and my fo
my reason to say no tomatino
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest slice
but that was when pineapple was

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh foot
oh no oh pussyfoot
oh no oh underfoot
oh no oh no bigfoot

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh foot
hear the bells of disgust a ringing
pineapple on pizza
be my enemy and my frowning
my reason pussyfoot
for some reason I can't plain
I know saint underfoot
never an honest slice foot aquitaine
but that was when afoot
pineapple was on my pizza plate
and I couldn't barefoot
the taste of pineapple anymore foot
