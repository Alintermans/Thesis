[Intro]
come on folks gather round and let me say this true

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's flavor's alliston
I want you to hold out your hand and refuse
why don't we leave it alone
no more debate
when food preferences collate
pineapple just doesn't fit
and I'm the one who'll quit eating it oh

[Chorus]
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same as it should
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same as it should
as it was tanglewood
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza lovers unocal
why are you arguing at the table
what kind of toppings are you
ringing the bell
and everyone's shaking their head
your taste buds live alone now
they just want to know what's ahead oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same as it should
in this world of taste bud
you know it's not the same as it should
as it was tanglewood
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home try new dishes fast internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave tradition behind and explore new
I don't wanna talk about who's ordering it

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was not the same as
as it was as it was
