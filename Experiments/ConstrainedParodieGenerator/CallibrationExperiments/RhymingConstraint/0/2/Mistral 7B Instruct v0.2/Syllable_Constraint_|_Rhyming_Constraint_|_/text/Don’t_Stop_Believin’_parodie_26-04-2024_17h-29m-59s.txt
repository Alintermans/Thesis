[Verse 1]
just a small town cook with an unusual dish
pineapple on a pizza causing quite a
a city palate with a taste so bold and free
pineapple on a pizza ruvalcaba

[Verse 2]
a chef in a crowded kitchen
the scent of sauce andonian
for a bite they can share the meal
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
waiting in the line so long
their cravings searching for delight
cheese lights people
living just to find a taste so
hidden in the pizza pie

[Verse 3]
striving hard to satisfy
everyone wants a unique
paying any price to roll the dice
just one more slice

[Verse 4]
some will savor it with
some will shun it with a gro
the pizza debate never
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
waiting in the line so long
their cravings searching for delight
cheese lights people
living just to find a taste so
hidden in the pizza pie

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lightspeople
don't stop believing
hold on
pizza lightspeople
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lightspeople
