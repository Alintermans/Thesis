[Intro]

topping fiasco I'm stuck in a pineapple land

I'm just a simple pie lover butala
easy come easy go with ham and cheese or pepperoni
but pineapple on top just doesn't seem to be mineola

mama just put a slice
of pineapple on my pizza pie and I died inside

begun but now I've ruined it with this
mama ooh didn't mean to make you sigh
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

too late my pizza's done
sends shivers down my spine with every bite so un

gonna leave you all behind and face the truth

sometimes I wish I'd never ordered at all
