[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a reason tonight
pineapple just isn't

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to ponder something tasty
to create austerity
to top our savory
do you taste my recipes
or do you skip our decree
when you said you'd try italy
was our creation on
I knew when I asked you to join us atari
you'd do the opposite oflaherty
and we'd end up more appalled by the sight of pineapple onofre
so if you really wanna
know the secret to our
pizza's perfect harmony and balance true ohoh
no pineapple on our pie

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza pie is
right we're happier than ever tonight wishing for
a reason why we could explain it better ohoh wehmeier
pineapple just isn't right

[Verse 2]
you call us again with pineapple
in your hand under the influence
you confused us to death with your insistence
but we only listen to our taste
we don't relate to you
we don't relate to you no
'cause we'd never top our pizza
this way we hate this kitchen

[Verse 3]
and we don't spread rumors about you on the inter
net never told anyone anything
'cause that's just not our style and taste is subjective
but you made us hate this kitchen scene anding
so don't waste our time we don't
have and don't try to make us feel
bad we could talk about every time that you showed up on
time but we'd have an empty line because you never
did respect our ingredients and friends so we shut
'em all out for you because we were just kids at

[Outro]
you ruined our perfect
combination always said you were
underestimated made
all our moments your own just leave us
al
one oh
just
leave us
alone
