[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up and declare

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple on pizza is a crime against taste
a culinary abomination that
can't be defended with reason or grace aut
umn leaves falling down like flavors out of place

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pizza's not the same no
more and I might be okay but my taste buds are
not fine at

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that menu list you
almost ordered it cause you were looking at me wishing it
was something more than just a
topping on a pie but I stopped

[Verse 3]
photo of a hawaiian pizza on the counter your
stomach was turning green you used to be a little kid with a big
appetite and your mom's telling stories bout you eating all
the toppings off the pie and leaving the crust behind
and you were tossing me the menu like fuck the rules sidel
e dish on the ground we were always skipping town
and I was thinking on the drive down any topping
now he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it
was til we were full and gone and
buried in a sea of cheese and sauce and then
you wondered where it went to
as I reached for a slice but all I felt was shame and you
held my lifeless fork yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing bout the toppings in the refrigerator
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept your pineapple pizza a secret but I
kept my disgust astra
sacred prayer and we'd swear to never

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all
up running scared I was
there I remember it all too
well and you call me up again just to break me like a prom
ise so casually cruel in the name of being brut
ally honest I'm a crumpled up piece of nap
kin lying here cause I remem

[Verse 4]
ber it all all all they say all's well that ends well but
I'm in a new hell every time you
double cross my taste buds mind you said if we had been closer in age
maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die the idea
you had of me who was she a never needy ever lovely foodie
whose shine reflects on you not weeping
in a party bathroom some chef asking
me what happened you
that's what happened you you who charmed my taste bud
s with self effacing jokes sipping coffee like
you're on a late night show but then he watched me watch the menu all
night willing you to come and he said it's supposed to be

[Verse 5]
fun turning twenty one time won't fly it's like
I'm paralyzed by It I'd like to be my old self again but I
m still trying to find it after plaid shirt days and
nights when you made me your own now you mail backlund
my old toppings and I walk home alone but you
keep my old pizza box from that very first week cause
it reminds you of innoc
ence and it smells like cheese you can't

[Chorus]
get rid of it cause you remember it
all too well yeah you remember it all too well wind
in my hair you were there
you remember it all too well
down the stairs you were there you
remember it all too
well it was rare I was
there I remember it
all too well wind in hair
you were there you remember it

[Verse 6]
all too well and I was never good at telling jokes but the
punch line goes I'll get older but your pineapp
les stay my age from when your hawaiian
broke my taste buds and bones I'm a soldier who
s returning half my weight and did
the twin flame bruise paint you blue just between us did
the love affair maim you too
cause in this city's barren cold I still
remember the first fall of snow
and how it glistened ashebor

[Outro]
fell I remember it all too well just between us did
the love affair maim you all too well just between us
do you remember it all too well just between us I masted
it all too well wind in my hair I was
there I was there down the stairs I was
there I was there sacred prayer I was
there I was there it was rare you remember
it all too well wind in my hair I was
there I was there down the stairs I was
there I was there sacred prayer I was
there I was there it was rare you
