[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on aol
but I don't really care for their opinion
it's just not right no matter how
you slice it up or serve it with
it's a flavor that just doesn't fit in with

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 2]
your taste buds may be confused but mine
are not so easily fooled he
the thought of it just makes me shudder and qu
it's a crime against culinat
it's not a topping that I'd ever
want on my pizza that's for sure hallelu

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 3]
you say I'm just a picky e
but when It comes to pizza I
know what I like and what I don't ea and
pineapple is a no go for me it
just doesn't belong on a pie
it's a travesty a culinary lie

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 4]
I know some people may disag
but to me it's just not worth the gam
I'll stick to my toppings that are tried and true
and pineapple will never make
it to my pizza that's just what
I'll stand by my convictions hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola
hallelujah hialeah
pineapple on pizzeria
hallelujah hilaria
pineapple on pumilia
hallelujah hacienda
pineapple on puttanesca
hallelujah hagiwara

[Outro]
hallelujah hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
I know some people may think
it's just a topping like any
other but to me it's so much more than that
it's a flavor that just doesn't fit in
with the others it's aherin
it's a crime against culinary hallelu

[Additional Lyrics]
I remember when I first tried
pineapple on a pesticide
it was a mistake I'll never forget he
it ruined the flavor ofc
every other toiletry
it was a culinary regret hallelu

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a place for it
in some tropical paradise
but not on my pizza that's for sure it's not
a flavor that I'd ever prize hallel
it's a cold and it's ailurophile
hallelujah hallelujah pineapple on
