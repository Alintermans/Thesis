[Intro]
come on now folks and give an ear to me today

[Verse 1]
taste is key yet
pineapple's ruining it
place it on a slice and watch it all go wrong
why can't people just stick to
cheese and pepper
it's a fruit that just should never
be part of pizza dinner
in this world it's just us truth to say it

[Chorus]
you know it's not the same
with pineapple on a pizza game
in this world it's just us
pineapple's a shame on pizza fame
as it was aspartame
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
call the chef and
tell him to forget the trend
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
ring the alarm and let it
be known that it
should never be allowed on a
pizza feast oh no no no
in this world it's just us truth to say it you

[Chorus]
you know it's not the same
with pineapple on a pizza game
in this world it's just us
pineapple's a shame on pizza fame
as it was aspartame
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home and make your own pizza pie no
pineapple in sight let it be a delight without
leave the pineapple out of the pizza
game and you'll see it's not the same as before da da

[Outro]
as
it was as
pineapple's not allowed on pizza
as it was aspartame
