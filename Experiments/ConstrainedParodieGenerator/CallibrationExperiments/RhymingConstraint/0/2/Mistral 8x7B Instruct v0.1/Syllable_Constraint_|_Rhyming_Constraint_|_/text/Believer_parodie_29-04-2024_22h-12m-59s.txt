[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
its taste is a cursea bitter
on a slice it does not belong
on a slice it does not belong

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare put it on my dish out spicy
its texture ruins the
harmony of cheese and tomato
harmony of cheese andino

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet pure
pizza was sacred and so sure now
it's tainted by this sweet fruit's reign
I can't abide by this trendy campaign feeling
betrayed by this culinary
travesty that's driving me ins
ane seeing the disunity
of flavors clashing in my brain

[Chorus]
pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice
believer I am not
pain you've brought me with this travesty of taste
my love for pizza has been replaced
pain you've put me through with pineal
believer I am not

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a curse to the ones who started
this monstrosity cur
sed on a dish that once was sacred oh
on a dish that once was sacred

[Pre-Chorus]
I was hoping for a change
but this trend's become so strange now
it's time to take a stand and say
no more pineapple on my tray
it's time to take a stand and say no more pineapple
on my pizza tray no more pineapple on my pizza tray
no more pineap

[Chorus]
pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice
believer I am not
pain you've brought me with this travesty of taste
my love for pizza has been replaced
pain you've put me through with pineal
believer I am not

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the pizza gods above
you're the face of the future
the blood in my veins oh oh
the blood in my veins oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
no more pineapple on my pizza tray no more pine
more on my pizza tray no more pineapple on my pizza
tray no more pine

[Chorus]
pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice
believer I am not
pain you've brought me with this travesty of taste
my love for pizza has been replaced
pain you've put me through with pineal
believer I am not
