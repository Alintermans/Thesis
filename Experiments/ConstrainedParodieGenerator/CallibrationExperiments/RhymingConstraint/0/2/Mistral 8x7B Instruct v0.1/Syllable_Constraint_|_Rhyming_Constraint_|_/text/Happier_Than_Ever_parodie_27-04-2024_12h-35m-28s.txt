[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue and mad
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just shouldn't be

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a paratrooper
to tell me what to do with
this pineapple disaster
do you see my frustration brew
or do you skip theodorou
when you said you'd never do
such a thing to me and my pizza pie andrew
I knew when I asked you toshimitsu
be cool about what I was tellin' youyou'd do the opposite of what
you said you'd do and put pine
on my pizza anyway
don't say it isn't fair you clearly weren't there
to see the pain you caused to me

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue and
happier without it ever been so true wish it
wasn't true but it just shouldn't be mm mm mm mm mm mm hit
the nail right on the head with

[Verse 2]
you call me again with pineapple
on your pizza plate I scream inside
you scared me to death but I'm wastin' my breath
'cause you just don't seem to mind pineal
on your pizza slice I don
't relate to you I don't want
pineapple on my pizza slice
'cause I'd never treat me this way

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about pineapple on the net
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me want to shed
a tear so don't waste the time I don
't have and don't try to make me feel
bad I could talk about every time that you showed up on
time with pineapple on your plate but I'd have an em
pty line cause you never did never paid any mind to
my opinion or taste so I shut them all

[Outro]
you ruined my pizza good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone yeah fuck pine
