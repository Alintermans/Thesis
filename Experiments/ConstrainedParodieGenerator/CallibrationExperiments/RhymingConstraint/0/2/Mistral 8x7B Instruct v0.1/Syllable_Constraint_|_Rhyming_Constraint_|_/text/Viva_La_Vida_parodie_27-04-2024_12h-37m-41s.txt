[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice foot
now in the morning I take a bite
of a pizza thatcherite

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to love the taste
but now it's ruined by the pine's
juicy sweetness overpow
ers the savory sauce andriano
one bite and I held my breath
next I spit it out in ste
alth and found the crust just as bland as death
on a pizza that's built on lies and deceit

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of outrage ringing loud
hawaiian pizza lovers form a
crowd be my protest sign and shield
my comrades in the fight against this field
for some reason I can't explain
once you've tasted real pizza
never again will pine
apple grace this sacred dish I

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a sick and twisted trend
that brought this monstrosity to
an end revolutionaries wait
for the pineapple to leave our plates
just a topping on a throne
a mistake that should have never
been made who would ever want pineapple on
their pizza pie it's time to over

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of outrage ringing loud
hawaiian pizza lovers form a
crowd be my protest sign and shield
my comrades in the fight against this field
for some reason I can't explain
I know the pizza gods won't forgive
the blasphemy of pine
apple on a pizza pie it

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh no oh no oh no
hear the bells of outrage ringing loud
oh no oh noverco
mets be my protest sign and shield proud
my comrades inerco
de in the fight against this field
for some reason I can
't explain I know the pizza gods won't
forgive the blasphemy
of pineapple on a pizza pie

back the true pizza pie
and never let the pineapple
