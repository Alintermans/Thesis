[Intro]
pineapple on pizza pie oh say is

[Verse 1]
once the box was opened wide
cheese and sauce mixed with pineapple
taste and smell together coll
your stomach turns and

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three bites later I see the regret
pizza's meant for pepperoni or sausage not a fruit yet
pineapple's place is in a tropical retreat not onset
of heartburn and regret and a stomach that's upset baby yeah

[Chorus]
was it wrong to put pineapple on pizza
was it wrong to mix the sweet with savory
said it tasted good but now you
feel like throwing up baby was it
over then and is it over now no way

[Post-Chorus]
pineapple on pizza

[Verse 2]
when you took a bite and frowned
saw the disappointment
pineapple chunks all around
should have stuck to the bas

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the look of disgust
at least I had the decency
to not order pineapple
just rumors of bad taste and regret
and a pizza that
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to get away from this
pizza that's not worth living for baby no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three slices later I see the regret
pizza's meant for classic toppings not a tropical set up yet nolette
pineapple's place is in a fruit salad not on a pizza base
next time you'll think twice before you disgrace the pizza base baby

[Chorus]
was it wrong to put pineapple on pizza
was it wrong to mix the sweet with savory
said it tasted good but now you
feel like throwing up baby was it
over then and is it over now no way

[Post-Chorus]
pineap
le on pizza oh say
is it
over now no

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
the look of disgust
at least I had the decency
to not order pineapple
just rumors of bad taste and regret
and a pizza that
oh lord I think about jumping
off of very tall buildings
just to get away from this pizza
that's not worth living for baby no no no

[Outro]
