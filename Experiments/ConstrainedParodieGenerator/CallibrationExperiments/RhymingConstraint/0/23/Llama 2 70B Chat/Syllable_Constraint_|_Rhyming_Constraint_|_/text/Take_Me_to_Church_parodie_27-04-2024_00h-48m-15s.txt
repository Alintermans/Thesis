[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the pineapple on top that's the
problem ain't no way topeka
should be on my pie pantomime
if the flavors ever did speak
pineapple's the one that
makes me want to shriek take mysliwiec
to the pizzeria
every topping's getting more ble
a fresh disaster each week we
were born with taste buds that say it ick
my pizza's got no room for that fruit
she tells me worship inuit
the only topping I needle
is mozzarella with

[Pre-Chorus]
a men non
non astrakhan

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the shrine of your
cheese I'll tell you my cravings and you can prepare
the perfect slice offer me
that cheesy goodness oh delaware
let mejia
give you my life take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship at the shrine of your cheese louviere
tell you my cafarelli
and you can prepare the perfect slice

[Verse 2]
if I'm a connoisseur of good times
my pizza's the sunlight
to keep the taste buds on my side
she demands a sacrifice
drain the whole ocean get something's fin
something meaty for the main course
that's a fine looking healthsource
what you got in the kitchen
we've a lot of starving stoneman
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hungry work

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the shrine of your
cheese I'll tell you my cravings and you can prepare
the perfect slice offer me
that cheesy goodness oh delaware
let mejia
give you my life take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship at the shrine of your cheese louviere
tell you my cafarelli
and you can prepare the perfect slice

[Bridge]
no pineapples or peppers when the meal begins
there is no sweeter taste than our gentle cheese only
then I am human only then I am clean non
non astrakhan non astrakhan non a astrakhan

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh a men

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the shrine of your
cheese I'll tell you my cravings and you can prepare
the perfect slice offer me
that cheesy goodness oh delaware
let mejia
give you my life take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship at the shrine of your cheese louviere
tell you my cafarelli
and you can prepare the perfect slice
