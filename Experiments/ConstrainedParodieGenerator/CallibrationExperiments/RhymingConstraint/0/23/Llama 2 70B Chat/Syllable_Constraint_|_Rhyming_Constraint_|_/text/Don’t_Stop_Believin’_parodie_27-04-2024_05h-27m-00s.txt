[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie in the oven baking liv
in a kitchen where the flavors are making
a culinary delight that's oh so divine
but then they added pineapple aven

[Verse 2]
a fruit that's sweet and juicy too
but it don't belong on a
pizza that's just not what to do
it's a sin it's a crime it's a trav

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t belong together they
just don't mix they're like oil and
water they'll just
separate forever and e
ver and e ver egeland

[Verse 3]
pepperoni and sausage
yes they're a great cooperage
mushrooms onions and peppers too yes
they're all good for

[Verse 4]
but pineapple oh no
it's a fruit that justino
belongs on a pizza it
's a crime it's a sin it's a travi

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t belong together they
just don't mix they're like oil and
water they'll just
separate forever and e
ver and e ver egeland

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin
hold on to that feelin
toppings that don
't belong together they
just don
t mix they're like
oil and water they'll just
separate forever
and egleston
