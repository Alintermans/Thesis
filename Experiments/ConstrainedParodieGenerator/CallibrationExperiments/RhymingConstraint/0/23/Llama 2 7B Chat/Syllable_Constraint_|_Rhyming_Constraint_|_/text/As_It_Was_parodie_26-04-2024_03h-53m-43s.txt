[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza should not be seen or

[Verse 1]
don't put it
it's not a fruit that belongs
on a pie that's hot and cheesy too soon or
it'll make a mess and ruin
the flavor of
the sauce and the cheese and the love
that we all know and adore
don't do it don't do it please don

[Chorus]
it's not the same as it
was back in the day when pineapple
was a novelty it
was a treat it was asexual
it's not theatrical
as it was in the past

[Verse 2]
it's a fruit that
belongs on a coconut
or a tropical island in the sun
but not on a pizza that
we all love and
have fun in the summer with a
barbecue or a party
but not on a pizza that we all crave and

[Chorus]
it's not the same as it
was back in the day when pineapple
was a novelty it
was a treat it was asexual
it's not theatrical
as it was in the past

[Bridge]
so let's all agree to disagree and
respect each other's taste buds and preferences and
let's enjoy our pizzas without the
pineapple that we all know and detest and dislike

[Outro]
don
pineapple
it's not the same as it washable
it's not theatrical
