[Verse]
emerging from my denial and I've been doing
fine without that taste I've been declininguh u
stuck in my ways and I've been refusingthat slice so bland
it started with a bite but now I understand
it's a travesty to put pineapple on a
pizza base it's just a waste of space and taste it
clashes with the sauce and makes my stomach churnin
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're still defending it
I'll never everitt
let me go
and I just can't bear to see it on
my plate no mo'n'more

[Chorus]
jealousy of those who can enjoy it
swimmin' through a sea of dis
gust at the thought injustice
but it's just the price I pay
for my pizza pawtucket
open up my hopefulness
'cause I'm mr pineap
