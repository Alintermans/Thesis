[Intro]
I think I've had my fill of that sweet
pineapple on pizza dish we
once shared with glee and laughter now a
ghastly memory I can
never eat

[Verse]
I've tasted two disasters on
my plate and now I see the error of my ways sobon
appétit to that mess I'll never say
if I could turn back time I'd keep pineapple
far away from pizza traysome
choose tomato sauce and mozzarella instead of that
sweet and savory combo that I now
regret I ever ateI've tasted two disasters onmy
plate and now I see the error
of my ways so bon appétit to that mess I'll never say
if I could turn back time I'd keep pine
apple far away from pizza tracheal
some choose tomato sauce and mo
zzarella instead of that sweet and savory comet
hat I now regret I ever turlough
teI've tasted two disasters onmy plate and nowakowski

[Chorus]
I'll rot my taste bud
I'll rot myriad
I'll rot my taste buds away
I'll rot my tasted
I'll rot my taste bta
I'll rot my twisted

[Outro]
I'll rot my taste bud
I'll rot my pivoted
is my pain your pleasure
is all of my pain your leisure
enjoy
