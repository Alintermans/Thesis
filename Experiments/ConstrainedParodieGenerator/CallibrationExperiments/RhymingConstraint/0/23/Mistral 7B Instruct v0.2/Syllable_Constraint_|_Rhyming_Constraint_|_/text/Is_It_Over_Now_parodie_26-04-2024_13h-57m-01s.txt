is it right to dine with pineapple on

[Verse 1]

ants you crave my taste before it called you a culinova
traitor you search in every kitchen for something greater than

[Chorus]

was it wrong when he added it to my las
agna come here I whispered in
your ear in your dream as you passed out
was it wrong then and is it wrong nowadays

[Post-Chorus]
is it right is it right

[Verse 2]

[Bridge]

only rumors about my love for
traditional fa

[Chorus]

your ear in your dream as you passed out
was it wrong then and is it wrong nowadays

[Post-Chorus]
is it

is it islet

[Bridge]
think I didn't taste it
there were complaints of
at least I had the decency
to keep my preferences
only rumors about my love for
traditional fa
se and my whispered sighs oh
lord I think about adding
exotic flavors just to see you
come running and say the one thing I've been long

[Outro]
flashin' lights oh lord let
's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later onset
flashin' lights I was hoping you'd be there
and say the one thing I've been
longing for but noxon
regret
is it right is it right is it right is it right
