[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping fiasco I'm stuck in a pine debona
open your eyes to the toppings galena
I'm just a simple pie who needs noyola
but pineapple's here and it's ruining my flowla any
way the sauce drips I can't let it go la la laudicina

[Verse 1]
mama just put pine on
plopped it down right in the middle of my pizza zone ma
ma life had just begun with
pepperoni and olives in perfect
ma ooh didn't mean to make you sigh but
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my taste has come
sends shivers down my spine with every bite so un
goodbye my favorite flavors all the
time my taste buds are aching all the time ma
mama ooh any way the sauce flows
I don't wanna pine
sometimes I wish I'd never ordered this at
