[Verse 1]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
it's a mystery of the
food chain's quirks and twists and turns we
hope you're not the one who ordered up this error
it looks quite odd upon your
pizza pie but it ain't

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems we
can't escape the taste of pineapple
the horror story repe
alses as we keep oncology
we never order right it seems weevil
can't escape the taste

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta change our order
we gotta change our order
just stop your whining it'll be better
they told me that our taste bud
s will understand theodor

[Verse 2]
just stop your whining let your palate fly high
soaring through the savory
skies remember every
pizza pie will be alright we can find
another topping somewhere
somewhere far away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems we
can't escape the taste of pineapple
the horror story repe
alses as we keep oncology
we never order right it seems weevil
can't escape the taste

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta change our order
we gotta change our order
stop your whining baby it'll be better
they told me that our taste bud
s will learn to adapt andler

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems we
can't escape the taste of pineapple
the horror story repe
alses as we keep oncology
we never order right it seems weevil
can't escape the taste

[Bridge]
we don't discuss the
toppings enough we
should open up before
it's all too much will
we ever learn to
choose the right toppings

[Outro]
stop your whining baby it's a sign of the times
we gotta change our
order we got to change our order weeber
we got to change our order weisenburger
