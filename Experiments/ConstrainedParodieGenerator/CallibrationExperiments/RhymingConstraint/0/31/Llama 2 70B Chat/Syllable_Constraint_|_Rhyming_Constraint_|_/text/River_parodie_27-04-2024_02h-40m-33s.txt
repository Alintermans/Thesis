[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolish man and made
a mess of things that cannot
be undone and now it's time to pay the price for my mistakes
I've been a liar and a cheat and now it's time to face
the truth and let the river run
all my sins need holy water andalusian
feel it washing over

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've been a pizza lover for so long but
now I see the error of ways
putting pineapple on top of a
masterpiece is a sin and a shame and it's time
to make things right and let the river run chocolate
I've been a cheat to my taste buds and now
it's time to face the truth and let the river run free from
pineapple on pizza it's a crime and a disgrace to the culi
nary world and it's time to
make a change and let the river run with integrity
and honesty and true flavor and no more lies
and deception and pineapple on pizza it's time to
admit that it's wrong and move on
and find a new love that's true and pure and not a lie
like pineapple on pizza it's time to say goodbye and let the
river run and start anew and find aka
new love that's real and true and not a fake

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolish man and made

I've been a liar and a cheat and now it's time to face
the truth and let the river run
all my sins need holy water andalusian
feel it washing over

I've been a cheat to my taste buds and now it's time to
face the truth and let the river run free from pepperon
I on pizza it's a crime and a disgrace to the culinary world

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride he
fuck can I say if life wasilewski
highway and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in
five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin' on ice
maybe that's why I came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
but I made you terminate my baby
this love triangle left us in a reck tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a foolish man and made
a mess of things that cannot

I've been a li

let the ri
ver run all my sins need holy
water andalusian feel it wasielewski
over me I'm sorely
