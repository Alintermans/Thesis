[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against humanity somehow
I can't believe they
think it's a good idea to combine
sweet and savory in such a way that's just not right
it's like they're trying to

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out of my headspace
and I'm feeling a little peculiar today
wake up in the morning and step outside in dismay
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my voice
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey he
hey heidi
I said hey what's going on here
and I say heatedly
hey hefty
I said hey what's going on here

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I try to
oh my goodness dopa
I try all the time
in this pizza parad
and I pray
oh my goodness doomsday
I pray every single day
for a pivoted

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out of my headspace
and I'm feeling a little peculiar today
wake up in the morning and step outside in dismay
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my voice
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey he
hey heidi
I said hey what's going on
and I say heatedly
hey hefty
I said hey what's going on here
and I say heatherly
hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey he

[Outro]
pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against humanity somehow
I can't believe they think
