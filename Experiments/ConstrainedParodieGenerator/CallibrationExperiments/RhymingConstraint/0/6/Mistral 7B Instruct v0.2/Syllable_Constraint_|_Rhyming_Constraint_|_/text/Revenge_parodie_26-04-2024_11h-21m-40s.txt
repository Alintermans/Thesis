[Intro]
I think I've made a grave mistake or
placed a fruit on a dish that's a
pineapple on a pizza error
pineapple's not a savvy
composer

[Verse]
I've ordered pies with ham and pe
ppers and olives galore but now I see austerity
oh pineapple pie in paradise
if I could take it back I'd hide it from your
eyes oh man what a world the things
we put on our pies if I could act on my dislike
and remove it from your slice it's not a
delight it's not a spice it's not a nice surprise oh man what
a world the things we dolecki
fruit on our pies and you'd have thought that I wassily
would let it be but no iodice
it's not a garnish it's not a basehore
pineapple on a hotaling
breaks the taste fast and I don't wanna let pincerlike
claws tear it off so in myopia
I'll rot it out I'll rot it out I'll rot it out elliott

[Chorus]
in my grave I'll rot
in my cypriot
in my grave I'll rot rot rot
in my kennecott
in my grave I wonnacott
in my ocelot

[Outro]
in my grave I'll rot
I'll rot rot kennecott
is my taste your freedom
is all of my taste buddhism
your new
