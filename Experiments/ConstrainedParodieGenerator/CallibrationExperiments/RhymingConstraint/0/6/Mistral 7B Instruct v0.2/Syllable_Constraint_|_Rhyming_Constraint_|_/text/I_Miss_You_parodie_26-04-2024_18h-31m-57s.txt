[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the fruit that ru debonair
the topping in the pie of despair we
can live without pineapple
if we want our pizza
where you can always find me near the cheese and
tomatoes andolina
and we'll have summer on our plates
but pineapple ruins every bite
we'll wish this monzonite

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the harmony and balance
I cannot eat with pineapple's presence
I crave the taste of tradition
this unwelcome intr
uder comes creeping on with every slice
and as I chew I ponder
the texture and the flavor
clashing with the savory blend of
tomatoes and cheese and pepper
like a tropical surprise
will you remove this pineapple lieurance
and let convenience

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside the
pizza's head I pine for
don't add your fruit to me itty
don't add your fruity
don't add pinegar

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside the
pizza's head I pine for
don't add your fruit to me itty
don't add fruitlessly
don't add pinegar
don't add your fruit to me itty
don't add italy
don't add pinegar
don't add your fruit to me itty
don't add itasca
don't add pinegar

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace at op
I pine for peace at top
