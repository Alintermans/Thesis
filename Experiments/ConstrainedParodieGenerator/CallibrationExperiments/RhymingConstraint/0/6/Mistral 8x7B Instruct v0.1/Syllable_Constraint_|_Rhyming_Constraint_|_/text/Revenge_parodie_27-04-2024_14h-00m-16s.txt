[Intro]
I think I've had my fill of that sweet
pineapple on pizza dish we
once shared with glee and laughter now a
ghastly memory I can
uncomplete

[Verse]
I've tasted two abomina
tions now my friend oh can't you see the harmonia
of flavors clashing in my mouth it
sickens me to think I ever thought it nice
some mix sweet and savory but
pineapple on pizza is a crime I'll never advise
it's time to take a stand and say no to
these monstrosities before they spread and take control I'll rot
in my distaste forsythia
for that sweet and savory sin I'll never beata
pizza with pineapple everitt
again I'll rot in my disdain orefice
for that unholy complicit
pizza topping I'll rot in my refusal notifies
it's time to take a stand andolina
say no to these monstrosities before they spread aforeth

[Chorus]
I'll rot I'll rot in
my refusal in
my refusal I'll rotot
I'll rot myelin
my refusal willamette
I'll rot myelin

[Outro]
I'll rot I'll rot in
my refusal itkin
is my pain your freedom
is all of my pain axiom
enjoy
