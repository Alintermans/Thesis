[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to crave the taste
of pineapple on my pizza
but now I see the error of the
massive mistake inversely

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to think it was
a tropical twist on a classic
but now I see the truth is
pineapple doesn't belong invoices
it's like a sin to put it
on a pie that guesstimate
ought to be a crime in italy or
spain or wherever they make theatergoer

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringin' in
my head as I choke on myelin
be my mirrored reflection of
my regret and disappoint aversive
my taste buds in a foreign field of
never an honest word to
justify the abom
ination of pineapple on

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild wind
that blew open my eyes to see
the error of my ways and the truth
that pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza that's meant to be a
masterpiece of flav orchestra
but now I see the truth is clear to me now
pineapple is a crime against cul

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringin' in
my head as I choke on myelin
be my mirrored reflection of
my regret and disappoint aversive
my taste buds in a foreign field of
never an honest word to justify
the abomination
of pineapple on a pizza
