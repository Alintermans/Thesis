[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the topping from disrepair
the fruit that's not supposed to be there on
a pizza that's oh so fair
we can live without it if
we must face the truth it doesn't belong here
and in the oven topliff
we'll wish this topping never came near
we'll wish this topping never came nearer
I miss pennebaker

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss p irelan

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor that we cra
where is the sweetness that we savor on
other toppings that we adore
but pineapple is
a taste that we can't ignore or ignore
it's a flavor that we can
do without it we must be
brave and face the truth it doesn't go
with the cheese and sauce and pepper
it's a topping that we must
avoid at all costs avoid allbritton
I miss moldovan
