[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolish man and made
a mess of things that cannot
be undone and now it's time to pay the price for my mistakes
I've been a liar and a cheat and now it's time to face
the truth and let the river run
let the river run and wash away allusion
of being the man that

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've been a pizza lover for a long time
but now I see the error of
my ways and I'm ready to make a
change and let go of my cravings for pantomime
I've been a cheese addict and a topping mannheim
but now I know the truth and it's time to
take a stand and let the river run and wash away all
the cheese and toppings that don't belong on a pizza so let the
river run and wash away
all the pineapples that don't belong on a pizza
let the river run and wash away anytime
any pineapple tries to get on my pizza again
let the river run and wash way
any pineapple that tries to get on my pizza
again let the river run and wash away any pineapple
that tries to get on my pizza again the
pineapple has got to go and now it

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolish man and made
a mess of things that cannot
be undone and now it's time to pay the price for my mistakes

the truth and let the river run
let the river run and wash away allusion
of being the man that
