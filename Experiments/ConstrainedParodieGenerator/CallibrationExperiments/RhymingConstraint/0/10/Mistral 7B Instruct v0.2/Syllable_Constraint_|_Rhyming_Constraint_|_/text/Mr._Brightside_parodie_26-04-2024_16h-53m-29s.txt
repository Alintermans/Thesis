[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta keep it cool because I hate the pineap
it started out on a pie but now it's on a pizza
now I'm cringin' inside and my taste isaiah
now they're savourin' each bite and I'm feelin' the
pineapple's on their plate and my appetite's
gone astray and it's all in my head again and
it's makin' me dread it

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savourin' each bite
he's enjoyin' the delight
let me be
I just can't partake in this misall
and takin' the lead

[Chorus]
pineapplesity turning good dishes
into a tropical dish
chokin' on your relinqu
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin' me
open up my eager eyes
'cause I'm mr rightside

[Guitar Solo]
