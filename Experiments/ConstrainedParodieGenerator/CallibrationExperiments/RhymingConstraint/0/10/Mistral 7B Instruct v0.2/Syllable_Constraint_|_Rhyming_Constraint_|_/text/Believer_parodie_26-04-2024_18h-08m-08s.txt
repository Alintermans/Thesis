[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
a taste that just won't reverse

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you judge me for my culinary cre
I'm the one who orders
pineapple on my pizza spree oh
pizza with pineapple spiro

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on traditional
toppings like pepperoni and on
but now I've gone tropical mad
pineapple's my new favorite addition gladly
savoring every bite with
pineapple's sweetness and zest in
enjoying the flavor cometh
pineapple's the best addition

[Chorus]
pain in my palate you made me a
pineapple believer
pineapple breaks me down builds me up
pineapple believer
pineapple let the controversy rain on
my pizza my passion my craving
pineapple you made mexicana
pineapple believer

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the pineapple gods
all the hate that you heard
has turned my taste buds into a goddess
pineapple's divine powerless

[Pre-Chorus]
I was skeptical at first
but now I've tasted the revers
pineapple's unique flavor burst
pineapple's the one that's always
ebbing and flowing in my heart's core forevermore
pineapple's the one that I adore and adore andretti
it's a flavor

[Chorus]
pain in my palate you made me a
pineapple believer
pineapple breaks me down builds me up
pineapple believer
pineapple let the controversy rain on
my pizza my passion my craving
pineapple you made mexicana
pineapple believer

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the pineapple and the
flavorful waves we've passed we
are the future of pizza
pineapple's theophila

[Pre-Chorus]
pineapple's the one that I've chosen to trust and to
believe in the power of the pineapple and the flavor
it's a flavor

[Chorus]
pain in my palate you made me a
pineapple believer
pineapple breaks me down builds me up
pineapple believer
pineapple let the controversy rain on
my pizza my passion my craving
pineapple you made mexicana
pineapple believer
