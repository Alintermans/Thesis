[Intro]
come on now folks and give an ear to me today

[Verse 1]
taste is key yet
pineapple's ruining it
place it on a slice and watch it all go wrong
why can't people just stick to
cheese and pepper
it's a fruit that just hasler
doesn't belong on pizza
it's a sinful error oh oh oh au

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this dish it's justus
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
it's a culinary fall
pineapple on pizza is a shameful
sight to see ring the bell and
no one comes to
rescue the pizza from this crime
it's just a waste of time oh
oh oh oh auauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauauau

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this dish it's justus
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home and cook something better than this
pineapple on pizza is a culinary ab
yss leave tradition and try something new
it's a fruit that just doesn't belong on pizza it

[Outro]

it was you
know it's not the same as itochu
as it was as it was
