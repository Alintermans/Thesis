I know a food that shouldn't be

[Pre-Chorus]
pineapple no no no how low
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no soho
pineapple no noxso

[Chorus]
with the taste obscured it's less absurd
here it comes now ruin our
dinner plans with pineapple stir
here it comes now ruin our
favorite dish with fruit absurd
pineapple libido onward

[Post-Chorus]

pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no soho
pineapple no noxso

[Chorus]
with the taste obscured it's less absurd
here it comes now ruin our
dinner plans with pineapple stir
here it comes now ruin our
favorite dish with fruit absurd
pineapple libido onward

[Post-Chorus]
