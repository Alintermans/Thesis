He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is off\nthe truth and my words now are falling like aco\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with pineapple on his plate\nto catch flack sweat jackets and dress\nslacks mismatched on his breath's a mistake\nhe's a mistake and she just wants to unimate\nit's a farce she's on his case like a carafate\nshe's kept track of all his culinary\nblunders and guess who just happens to be moving on to\nthe next dish actually just shit on my last dish and she has what\nmy ex lacks cause she hates pine\non her pizza and you don't put pineapple on a\npizza even I know that but she's deviate\nd some plan to sabotage his plate knife in hand says their\nrelationship's hanging by a\ncrust so she's been on the web lately says maybe she\nll be my pizza chef to spite her man and I know she's using\nme to try to play him I donizetti\ncare after the first bite but tonight I\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is off\nthe truth and my words now are falling like aco\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one topping pizza turned a pineap\nple pizza it was come morning light now we hug\ntight and he found out now she feels betrayed and\nused cause he left so what he did it first to\nher too now how am I supposed to tell this girl that\nwe're through it's hard to find the words I'm aloysia\nnervous and sue don't want this to hurt but what you des\nerve is the truth don't take it personal I just can't say ita\nin person to you so I revert to the studio like hole in\nthe wall diners don't have to be re\nserved In a booth I just feel like the person who I\nm turning into's irreversible I pray ondaatje\nand took advantage in my thomasina\nto pursue why do I do this dirt that\nI do got on my soapbox andre\ngent and bleach is burning the wound cause now with her\nin the oven we can't bring her in\nthis world shoulda knew to\nuse protection before I bit into your\nforbidden fruit fuck nooooohhhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oh\noh\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's pineapple on\npizza\nso\nlet the ri\nver run call me pine a\npple on pizza we'll let the river\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the main ingredient never\nthe side dish hey fuck can I saddler\nidgeway and deceit was an encampment I'd be ver\nging in five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin\non ice maybe that's why I may have came\nat you sideways I can't\nkeep my lies straight but I made you termine\nate my baby this love triangle left us in\na wreck tangled what else can I say it was\nfun for a while but I really wouldn\n't have loved your smile if you put pineapple on\nmy pizza fuck it what's one more lie to tell\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\ns gonna do is off the truth\nand my words now are falling like aco so let\n",
