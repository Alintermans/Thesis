[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we
must face this culinary war
you might think it's tasty but it's a flawed notion
it looks absurd on a pie
it's just not right my friend oh

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but still weirton
tempted by the sweetness of theism
on our pizza slic

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
face this culinary bluntest
we gotta get away from this topping
it's a sin on a pizza pie
we gotta get away from this

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and give it a
thought before you take a bite
it's not the way to go we
swear it's a mistake my friend oh no no
we can find a better match
somewhere far away from this

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but still weirton
tempted by the sweetness of theism
on our pizza slic

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
face this culinary unjust
we gotta get away from this topping on
our pizza pie we gotta
get away from this unbiased

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but still weirton
tempted by the sweetness of theism
on our pizza slic

[Bridge]
we don't taste enough
we should explore and
expand our palate
before it's all too
late we've been here once
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on us
we gotta get away
we got to get away from this topping today
we got to get away from this topping today
we got to get away from this
topping today we got to get
away from this topping today
