[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue and mad
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just ishida

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think it through now see here
why this fruit on pizza is
a culinary fear that
I can't abide by it
do you see my frustration brew
or do you turn your sisulu
when I bring it up to you
is it even on your plateway oahu
I knew when I asked you toshimitsu
be cool about what I was tellin' you you'd do the opposite true
and I'd end up more confound
don't say it isn't fair
you clearly weren't aware that you made me despair
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue and
wish I could explain it clearer but it just ishidae
wish it wasn't true mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[Verse 2]
you call me again with pineapple
on your pizza slice again oh no
you're ruining the taste for me oh no no
you're ruining the taste forseeable
you call me again with pine
apple on your pizza slice ag
ain oh no you're ruining the
taste for me ohbayashi

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about pineapple on pizza
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me leningrad
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line cause you never did ne
ver paid any mind to my mother or friends so I shut
'em all out for you cause I was aphrodite

[Outro]

always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone yeah fuck you
