[Intro]
I think I've had my fill of that sweet
pineapple on pizza dish we
once shared with glee and laughter now a

never un

[Verse]
I've sliced two pies for us before
but now I see the error of my ways for sure stanmore
oh pineapple on pizza floor what
a sight to see and never want to see no
more some like it hot some like it
not but you'd have thought I'd give it a go and take a bite
well now I know it's just not right so in
my fridge it'll stay and rot away I say no more to pine
apple on my pizza tray no
more I've sliced two pies for us before but now I see the
error of my ways for sure stanmore
oh pineapple on pizza floor what austro
bacio of disappointment it
brings to me no more I say no more I say no more to
pineapple on my pizza tray no more
no more no more no more to pineapple on my pizza tray

[Chorus]
in my fridge it'll
rot rotational
in my fridge it'll rot rot
in my fraternal
in my fridge it'll rot rot
in my fridge it'll

[Outro]
in my fridge it'll
rot rot rotational
is my pain your freedom
is all of my pain your freedom
enjoy
