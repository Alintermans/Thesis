[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
a taste that just won't pers worse

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you judge me for my culinary cre
I'm the one who orders
pineapple on my pizza's the key
pineapple on mycology

[Pre-Chorus]
I was served a slice once in a
kitchen filled with laughter and dismay
topped with ham and pineapple and
pepperoni and onions galore and still I stand
believing in the power of
pineapple's unique savory
savoring every bite of
pineapple's surprising flavor

[Chorus]
pain apple made me a believer
pain apple made me a
believer in the taste so unclear
pain apple madeira
pain apple breaks me down and builds me up high
my palate's love came from this fruit
pain apple made me alexander
pain apple made meara

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the food gods above
pineapple's inquired
has turned my taste buds to a dove oh oh
taste buds up above ohio

[Pre-Chorus]
I was skeptical in the
kitchen tasting every bite
but the sweet and savory blend
had me rethinking my diet
it never tasted inhibited or limited
pineapple's unique taste broke open and delighted myatt
it delighted

[Chorus]
pain apple made me a believer
pain apple made me a
believer in the taste so unclear
pain apple madeira
pain apple breaks me down and builds me up high
my palate's love came from this fruit
pain apple made me alexander
pain apple made meara

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the fire and the flame
you're the face of the future
pineapple's in my veins oh
pineapple's innuendo

[Pre-Chorus]
it never tasted inhibited or limited
pineapple's unique taste broke open and delighted my pal
it delighted

[Chorus]
pain apple made me a believer
pain apple made me a
believer in the taste so unclear
pain apple madeira
pain apple breaks me down and builds me up high
my palate's love came from this fruit
pain apple made me alexander
pain apple made meara
