[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolish man and made
a mess of things that cannot
be undone and now it's time to pay the price for my mistakes
I've been a liar and a cheat and now it's time to face
the truth and let the river run
all my sins need holy water andalusian
feel it washing over

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've been a pizza lover for so long but
now I see the error of ways
putting pineapple on top of a
masterpiece is a sin and a shame and aamod
I've been a fool to think it's a good idea
but now I see the light and I'm on the
right path and I'm on fire and I'm ready to fight for
what's right and what's true and what's pure and what's just and what's fair and what's good
and what's beautiful and what
's delicious and what's perfect and what's intended and what
's meant to be and what's right and what's just and what's fair
and what's good and what's beautiful and what's delicious and
what's perfect and what's intended
and what's meant to be and what's right and what's just and what
's fair and what's good and what's beautiful and what's delicious and what
's perfect and what's intended and what's meant to
be and what's right and what's just and what's fair

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a foolish man and made
a mess of things that cannot
be undone and now it's time to pay the price for my mistakes
I've been a liar and a cheat and now it's time to face
the truth and let the river run
all my sins need holy water andalusian

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride he
fuck can I say if life wasilewski
highway and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in
five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin' on ice
maybe that's why I came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
but I made you terminate my baby
this love triangle left us in a week tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a foolish man and made
a mess of things that cannot
be undone and now it's time to pay the price for my mistakes
I've been a li
ar and a
cheat and now it's time to face the truth and
let the ri
ver run all my sins need holy
water andalusian feel it wasielewski
over me I'm sorry
