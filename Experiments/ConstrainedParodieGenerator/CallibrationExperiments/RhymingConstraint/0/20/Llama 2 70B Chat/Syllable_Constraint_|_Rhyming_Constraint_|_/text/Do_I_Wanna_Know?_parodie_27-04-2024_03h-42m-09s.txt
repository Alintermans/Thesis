[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' with glee every bite you take
do you ever get that feelin' that it
just don't belong like a fruit

sticks out like a sore thumb like a hawaiian pizza
are there some flavors up your sle
that you're tryin' to
hide from me have you no idea that it's just not right how
many toppings can you combine before it's just

[Pre-Chorus]
too much do I wanna know if this topping flows
both ways sad to see you go was hopin' that you'd stay

with cheese in no way shape or form not today pistole
