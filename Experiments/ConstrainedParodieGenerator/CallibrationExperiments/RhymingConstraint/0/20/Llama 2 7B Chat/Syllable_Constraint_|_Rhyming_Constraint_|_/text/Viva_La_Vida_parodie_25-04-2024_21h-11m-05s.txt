[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to crave the taste
of pineapple on my pizza
but now I see the error of the
massive mistake inversely

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to think it was
a tropical twist on a classic
but now I see the truth is
pineapple doesn't belong on aces
it's like trying to put pe
kitten on aesthetically
pleasing pizza topping hierarchy
listen as the toppings sing incessantly

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells a ringin' loud and
clear as the voices of the tolland
be my mirror my sword and shield
my pizza toppings in a foreign field
for some reason I can't explain
I know the pineapple will
never be the king of
toppings on a pizza again

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild wind
that blew away the pineapple
from the pizza that I once knew and
loved and now it's gone forevermore or
never to be seen again
like a ghostly apparition
of a pizza topping past its prime time to
move on and embrace the new and true

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells a ringin' loud and
clear as the voices of the tolland
be my mirror my sword and shield
my pizza toppings in a foreign field
for some reason I can't explain
I know the pineapple will never be
the king of pizza to
ppings again oh oh oh oh oh
