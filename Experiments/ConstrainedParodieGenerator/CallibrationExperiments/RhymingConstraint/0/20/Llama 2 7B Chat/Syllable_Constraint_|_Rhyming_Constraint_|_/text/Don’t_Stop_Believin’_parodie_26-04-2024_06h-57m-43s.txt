[Verse 1]
just a pineapple on a pizza town girl liv
livin' in a lonely world of cheese and sau
she took the midnight train goin' anywhere but
not to pineapple on a pizza town boy

[Verse 2]
a topping in a smoky o
the smell of sweetness andino
for a bite they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the pizza joint
their toppings searchin' in the night
cheese and sauce and
livin' just to find flavor and
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get a slice
everybody wants a to
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more to

[Verse 4]
some will win with pepper
some will lose with olender
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the pizza joint
their toppings searchin' in the night
cheese and sauce and
livin' just to find flavor and
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin
hold on to that cheese and
streetlights people
don't stop believin
hold on
streetlights people
don't stop believin
hold on to that cheese and
streetlights people
