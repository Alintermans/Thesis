[Intro]
is this a bad pie or just a delusion
pineapple on pizza causing quite the confusion
look at this monstrosity andonian
I'm just a poor soul who needs no halligan
easy to add but ruins the dough's highs and lows anyway
the wind blows hard against this pizza abomination wayman

[Verse 1]
mama mia I just
topped a pizza with fruit I now regret it must confess
mama life had just begun
but now I've gone and ruined it all with
mama oh no I didn't mean to make
you cringe like this with this pineapple fake news
just carry on and order a new one like it never

[Verse 2]

pineapple on pizza sends shivers down my taste bud
goodbye to the pizza I once loved so
gotta leave it all behind and taste the truth
mama oh no I don't wanna
eat this anymore and
wish I'd never tried it at all no no no
