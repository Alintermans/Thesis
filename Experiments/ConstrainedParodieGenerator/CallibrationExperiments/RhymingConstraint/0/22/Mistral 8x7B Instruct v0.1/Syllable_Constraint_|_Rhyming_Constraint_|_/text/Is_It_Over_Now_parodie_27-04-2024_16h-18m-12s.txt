[Intro]
pineapple on pizza pie oh say is

[Verse 1]
once the box was opened wide
cheese and sauce mixed with pine inside
I took a bite and nearly
threw it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hours later icky taste still
haunts me to this day you said it would be okay but no way
you dreamed of ham and pepperoni not sweet andersonville
you search for taste in every slice but nothing can compare to

[Chorus]
was it wrong when I first saw it on the pie
was it wrong when I took the first bite and said
yuck this is not for me in your
dream as you took a slice baby was
it wrong then and is it wrong now no way no

[Post-Chorus]
no way oh say is it

[Verse 2]
when you lost your appetite
for real pizza tonight
pineapple on a boatright
side of wrong I sighted

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you
putting pineapple
on pizza oh at least I had
the sense to keep my distance
only rumors of my love for real
pizza and my ve
hement dislike oh lord I think
about eating real pizza
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hours later oh no way no way
if it's got pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably say noaa
you dream of real pizza before it called you a lying traitor
you search in every slice for somethin' greater baby no way

[Chorus]
was it wrong when I first saw it on the pie
was it wrong when I took the first bite and said
yuck this is not for me in your
dream as you took a slice baby was
it wrong then and is it wrong now no way no

[Post-Chorus]
no way
oh say is it wrong no
noaa
oh sayito

[Bridge]
think I didn't see you
putting pineapple
on pizza oh at least I had
the sense to keep my distance
only rumors of my love for real
pizza and my ve
hement dislike oh lord I think
about eating real pizza
just to see you come running and say
the one thing I've been wanting but noooo way no

[Outro]

wrong no no no no no no no no no no no no nolet
's fast forward to three hours later oh
no way I was hoping you
would agree oahu
