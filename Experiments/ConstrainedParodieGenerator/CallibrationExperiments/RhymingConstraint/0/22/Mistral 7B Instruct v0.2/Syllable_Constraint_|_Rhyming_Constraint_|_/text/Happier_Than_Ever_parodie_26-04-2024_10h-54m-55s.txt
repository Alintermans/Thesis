[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a reason tonight
pineapple shouldn't be

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to think of something tasty
to create austerity
to top our savory
do you read our critics
or do they skip our city
when you said you'd try italy
was our pizza even
on your menu that day we'd ask you toshiki
you'd do the opposite oflaherty
and we'd end up more confounded by your folly oh no itami
don't say it's a culin
ary triumph unknown to
us you clearly weren't aware that you made us pine
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now our pizza
is better than ever tasty and bright wish we could
explain it better to the world it's a mystery ellenwood
why pineapple shouldn't be

[Verse 2]
you call us again with a pepper
on our pizza pie under the
influence of your taste buds you scare us to
death but we're wasting our breadwinner
we don't relate to you
we don't relate to you no
'cause we'd never treat our dish this
way you made us disantis

[Verse 3]
and we don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's a spicy situation you were our
everything and all that you did was make us
sad so don't waste the time we don't
have and don't try to make us feel
bad we could talk about every time that you showed up on
time but we'd have an empty line because you never
did and never paid any mind to our family
or friends so we shut them all outmaneuver

[Outro]
you ruined our perfect
pie always said you were misdirect
made all our moments your
own just leave us alone yeah pineapple
no
ah damn
ah
just leave
us a
