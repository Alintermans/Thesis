[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
he's the joke at a barbeque pit
pineapple on a pizza it
I should've objected quicker
if the heavens ever did dec
this abomination
every slice gets more unitek
a fresh disappointment
we were born with different tastes they
my kitchen offers no relief
she tells me change the recipe book
the only peace I'll be served is when
I'm alone without thelin
I was born with different tastes
but I can't deny

[Pre-Chorus]
ahhh mennon
men nonhuman

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll argue like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good god let me give you astore
take mehaffey
I'll argue like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good god let me give you aancor

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the good e
my lover's the pizza
to keep the tradition on the
she demands a compromise
top the whole pie with something new and
something savory for the main
that's a fine lookin' delaine
what you got in the oven
we've a lot of starvin' vegan
that looks tasty that looks spiceland

I'll argue like a dog at the shrine of your pine

I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good god let me give you aancor

[Bridge]
no masters or kings when the debate begins in
there is no sweeter harmony than our gentle din
in the madness and chaos of that sad kitchen
only then I am human only then I amsden

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll argue like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good god let me give you astore

I'll argue like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
