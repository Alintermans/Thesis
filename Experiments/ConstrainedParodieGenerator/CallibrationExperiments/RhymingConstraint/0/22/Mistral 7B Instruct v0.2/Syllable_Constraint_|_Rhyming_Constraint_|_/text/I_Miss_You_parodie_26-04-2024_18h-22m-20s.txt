[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the fruit that ruins pizza
the mystery in the kitchen pantry
the unsuspecting palate
of flavor clash in the pie
we can live like friends if we want it so nice
where you can always find me
and we'll have harmony in our
dinner table scene instead of this fight
we'll wish this never be

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the harmony and I'm so
sorry for this pineapple debate we
cannot agree on the perfect
combination of
toppings for our meal tonight it's such a
vexing situation and
as I pondered I counted
the reasons for and against it all
like indecision to order
a pizza without this intr
usion of sweetness and acidity
will you joinery

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to mine it's already
the ingredient that
I pine for peace atop
don't add your fruit to mine itty bitty
the ingredient that
I pine for peace atop

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to mine it's already
the ingredient that
I pine for peace atop
don't add your fruit to mine itty bitty
the ingredient that
I pine for peace atop
don't add your fruit to mine itty bitty
the ingredient that
I pine for peace atop
don't add your fruit to mine itty billy
the ingredient that
I pine for peace atop

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
