[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the pie
seas of cheese would rise when I gave
now in the morning I eat alone
sweep the plates I used to own

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my palate's eyes
listen as the crowd would sigh
now the old king of taste is dead eli
one minute pineapple was
next a topping bananas
and I discovered that my pizzas stand
on pillars of sweet and savory bandstand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear controversy bells a ringin
pizza purists voices shavelson
be my mirror reflecting truth
my toppings in a flavor freyermuth
for some reason I can't explain
once you'd gone there was never
never an honest bite
and that was when I ruled the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild sauce
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered flavors and the sound of gro
answers couldn't believe what I'd become
pineapple partisans wait
for my head on a chlorinate
just a topping on a lonely string mmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmh
aw who would ever wanna be king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear controversy bells a ringin
pizza purists voices shavelson
be my mirror reflecting truth
my toppings in a flavor freyermuth
for some reason I can't explain
I know the pizza police won't call
never an honest bite
but that was when I ruled the pie

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh ohio
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh io

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
hear controversy bells a ringin
oh oh oh ohio
pizza purists voices shavelson
be my mirror reflect
ing truth my toppings in a flav
or freyermuth forgo
for some reason I can't explain hal

police won't call my name nevver

that was when I ruled the pie oh oh oh
