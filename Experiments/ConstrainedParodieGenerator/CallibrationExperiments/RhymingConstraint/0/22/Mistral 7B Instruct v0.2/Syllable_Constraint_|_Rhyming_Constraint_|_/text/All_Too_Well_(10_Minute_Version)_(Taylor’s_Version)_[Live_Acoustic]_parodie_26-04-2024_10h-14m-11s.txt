[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with a slice in hand and
pineapple on it seemed so strange and bizarre
but you left it there on your pizza counter
and now it's spoiling in your refriger jar

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple's sweet tang and my puzzled gaze collide
we're arguing in the kitchen about this
autumn leaves falling down like a fruitless fight ens
and I can picture it after all these tried

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little kitchen
floor you almost choked on your pizza pie because of me and
pineapple in your mouth it
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pineapple album on the counter rotting away in
your fridge your disdain was turning sour and redder than aherin
and your mother's telling stories about the day you met your
new favorite topping that replaced me in your bed
and you were tossing me the recipe book saying unwed
pineapple on pizza's the new trend and I was
thinking on the drive home any time now you'd admit
it's not love it's just a fad that's lost its luster and its
flavor and then you wondered where
it went to as I reached for you but all I
felt was disappointment and
you held my lifeless frame in disdain and scornfully said
no more pineapple on my pizza ever again

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
pineapple light down the
I remember it all too well
stairs I was there I was there I was there I was there
I remember it all too well pineapple in my hair
I remember itstee
I remember it all too well pine

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
pineapple pie in
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all pine pine

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had agreed on our pizza toppings maybe it
would have been fine but that made
me want to pineapple pie and die the thought
of you with someone else eating pineapple on their pizza pie was a
nightmare and you said if we had been
pineapple lovers maybe itasca
would have been fine the
idea you had of me who was she a
never needing never needing never needing
pineapple jewel whose shine reflects on you or a pineapple
villain who ruins every pizza pie for me and

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old pizza box from that very
first week it reminds you of innocence and it still
smells like me but aksamit
you can't get rid of it cause you

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
pineapple in my hair you
I remember it all
down the stairs I was there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapple toppings
stay the same age from when your pineapple
broke my heart and bones I'm a soldier who's ret
urning half your pizza pie and did
the pineapple flame bruise paint you blue just between
us did the love affair pine
apple maim you too cause in this city
pineapple's barren cold I still
remember the first fall of snow

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair pineapple maim you
all too well just between us do you remember it
all too well just between us I remember it all too well too
pineapple in my hair I was there pine
apple in my hair I wasserstein
pineapple in my hair I was there
pineapple in my hair I was there andrew
pineapple in my hair I was there pine
apple in my hair I was there pine
apple in my hair I was there pine
apple in my hair I was there
pineapple in my hair I was there pine
apple in my hair I was there pine
apple in my hair I was there pine
apple in my hair I was there
pineapple in my hair I was there pine
apple in my hair I was there pine
apple in my hair I was there pine
apple in my hair I was there pine perdue

[Spoken Outro]
