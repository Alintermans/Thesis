[Intro]
is it right to dine with pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once the pie had baked and cool
pineapple on the pizza rule
I savored every fool
your taste buds refused

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later I see
your toppings and your cheese on unsuspecting eaters' plates they
dream of my pepperoni before it called you achebe
you search in every chef's kitchen for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they added pineapple on
was it wrong when they sliced it thin and long oh
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now oh oh

[Post-Chorus]
is it wrong is it wrong

[Verse 2]
when you lost your taste control
tomato sauce redpoll
pineapple on aureole
your new dish is my poll

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
there were flashin' lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my pies out of sight
only rumors about my pepper
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about adding
exotic flavors high just
to see you come runnin' and
say the one thing I've been wanting but no no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred arguments later oh no
if it's got pineapple I will surmise that you'll probably disalvo
you dream of my pepperoni before it called you araujo
you search in every chef's kitchen for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they added pineapple on
was it wrong when they sliced it thin and long oh
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now oh oh

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it wrong is it wrong
is it
is it wrong is

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
there were flashin' lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my pies out of sight
only rumors about my pepper
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about adding
exotic flavors high just
to see you come runnin' and say the
one thing I've been wanting but no no no no

[Outro]
flashin' lights oh lord let
us fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later oh
flashin' lights I was hoping you'd be there
and say the one thing I've been
wanting but no noxon
was it
was it wrong is it wrong is it wrong is it wrong
