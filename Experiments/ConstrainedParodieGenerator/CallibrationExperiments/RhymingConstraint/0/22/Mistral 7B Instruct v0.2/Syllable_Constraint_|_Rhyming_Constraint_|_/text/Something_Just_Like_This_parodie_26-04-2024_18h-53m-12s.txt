[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on ahold
pizza's savory nu
but I'm not the kind
of palate that it's in
pineapple on a pizza's spin is not within me

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a dish with
some unusual twist or
a tropical to
a pizza's bliss is
just something I can turn to
somebody I can miss
I want something justices

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something justices
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something justices
I want something justices

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple on ahold
pizza's savory nu
and pepperonI's roll
a spicy suit before
but I'm not the kind of person that it's in

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk I
m not looking for a dish with
some unusual twist or
a spicy to a
pizza's bliss is just
something I can turn to some
body I canoeist

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something justices
I want something justices

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something justices
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something justices
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a dish with
some unusual twist or
a savarino
pizza's bliss is just
something I can turn to some
body I canoeist
I want something justices

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something justices
oh I want something justices
oh I want something justices
