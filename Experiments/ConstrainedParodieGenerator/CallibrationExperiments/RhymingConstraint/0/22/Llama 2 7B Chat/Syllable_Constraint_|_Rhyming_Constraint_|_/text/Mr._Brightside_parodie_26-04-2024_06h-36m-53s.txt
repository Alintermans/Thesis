[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza should not be the crime of
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
started out as a topping but now it's a crime scene oh
how did it end up like this it was justino
now I'm feelin' sick and my taste buds are in a
rage it's like a pineapple explosion in ma
head and it's all because of the pineapple on
top of the pizza and

[Pre-Chorus]
but the cheese is meltin' and
he's got the sauce inland
let me go
'cause I just can't take it no more it's kill
in' me soft spot and

[Chorus]
jealousy turnin' pizza into a
fiery inferno of
chokin' on alexandrov
but it's just the price I pay
destiny islamiya
open up my pizza eyes
'cause I'm mr pineale
