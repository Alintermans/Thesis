[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on aol
but I don't really care for their opinion
it's just not right no matter how
you slice it up or serve it with
it's a flavor that just doesn't fit in with

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah

[Verse 2]
your taste buds may be confused but mine
are not so easily susswein
I need some cheese and tomato sauce not fruit
on my pie that's just the truth I
can't be convinced otherwise it
just don't taste good no matter the portion

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 3]
you say I'm closed minded and a
flavor snob well maybe that's true
but when it comes to pizza toppings I'm a
purist through and through I don't want to
try your hawaiian pandora
pineapple has no place on a pizza stone

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 4]
I know you think it's a nice com

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've had pizza for
years and years and years andover
and I've never had a slice with pineapple
on it and I've never felt the need to
show it to you andromeda
and remember when we used to order pizza

[Additional Lyrics]
and every topping we chose
was always something delbarco
and it's not a flavor that you hear at night
it's not a taste that's ever ignite
it's a cold and it's acoly
hallelujah hallelujah pineapple on

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a pizza to
pping above but all I've ever
known is cheese and sauce and pepperoni love
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not a flavor that's ever right
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
