is this a bad pie or just a delusion
pineapple on pizza causing quite the confusion
look at this monstrosity andonian
I'm just a poor soul who needs no halligan
easy to add but ruins the dough's highs and lows anyway
the wind blows hard against this pizza abomination's wayman

[Verse 1]
mama I just ate a
pizza with pineapple on it and now I'm feeling quite
miserable and regret
my choice of toppings I cannot forget
mama I did not mean to make you ret
your trust in pizza now is second guessing
carry on eating as if nothing's wrongly blesseded

[Verse 2]
too late my slice is gone
a sweet and savory combo that left me feeling
forlorn goodbye to pizza as I knew
a pineapple abomination is what
I chewed mama I don't wanna
eat this monstrosity
I sometimes wish I'd never had a slice at
