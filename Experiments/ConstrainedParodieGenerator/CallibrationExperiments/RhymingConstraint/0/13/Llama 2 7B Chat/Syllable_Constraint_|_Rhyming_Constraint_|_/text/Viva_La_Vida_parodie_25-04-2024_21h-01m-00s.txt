[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to crave the taste
of pineapple on my pizza
but now I see the error of the
mistake that I've madeira

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to think it was
a tropical twist on a classic
but now I see the truth is
pineapple doesn't belong on aces
it's like a crime against che
pizza's honor andante
one bite and I'm transported back to the
beachside shack where I first tasted theora

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells are ringin' in dis

for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't
call my name never an
honest word but that was when I

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild wind
that blew pineapple onto the
pizza scene and now it's here to stay

pineapple on my pizza and it

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells are ringin' in dis
roman cavalry choirs are singin
be my pineapple slice and shield
my pizza's in a foreign field infield
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when I ruled the world
