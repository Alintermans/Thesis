[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni andries
and bbq with a
cheese that's all aflow
but pineapple just won
through to me it doesn't belong on a pizza gone

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said where d'you wanna go
how far will you pursue
I'm not looking for a slice that
is too exotic and new
just something savo
ry and tasty too
something I can share with you
something I can chew through
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo daewo
doo doo doo doo doo du
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo daewo
doo doo doo doo doo du
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
ham and pineapple please
but that's a no for me
and pineapple on a
pizza's not a thing to
do it's not my cup of tea and I won't

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much will you pursue I
'm not looking for a slice that's got
pineapple chunks inside it
just something yarbough
tasty and easy
something I can share with you
something I cangemi

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo daewo
doo doo doo doo doo du
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo daewo
doo doo doo doo doo du

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much will you pursue
I'm not looking for a slice that
is too exotic and new
just something savo
ry and tasty too
something I can share with you
something I can chubu
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
