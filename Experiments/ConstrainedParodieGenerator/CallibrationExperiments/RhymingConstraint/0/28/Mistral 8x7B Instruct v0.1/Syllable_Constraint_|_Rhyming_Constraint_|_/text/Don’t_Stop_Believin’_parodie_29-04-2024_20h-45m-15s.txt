[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and tom
just a foodie born and raised in new york city
pizza lover on a quest to find onecomm

[Verse 2]
a slice in a crowded pizzer
topped with pineapple and tears of
chefs who cringe and shake their head in
disbelief it goes on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
arguing up and down the
streets their opinions searchin' in
pizza boxes
fighting just to keep emotion
hiddin' somewhere in thelin

[Verse 3]
working hard to find the best
pizza slice to impress guest
paying anything to taste the best
just one more slice

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
hate it some are doctrinal
about pineapple on a
pizza oh the debate never ends

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
arguing up and down the
streets their opinions searchin' in
pizza boxes
fighting just to keep emotion
hiddin' somewhere in thelin

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hatin' on
pineapple on pizza
pizza lovers
don't stop hollomon
pineap
pizza lovers
don't stop hambleton
pineapple ondaatje
pizza lovers
