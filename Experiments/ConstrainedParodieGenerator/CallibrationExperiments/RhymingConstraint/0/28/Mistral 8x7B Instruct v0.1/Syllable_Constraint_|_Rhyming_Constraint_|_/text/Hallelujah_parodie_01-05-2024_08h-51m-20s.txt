[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for it do ya pov
it goes like this the dough the sauce
the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the baffled chef adds pineapple to it

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco

[Verse 2]
your taste was fine but you needed proof
you tried it once and it ruined
your trust in pizzas aloof with pineapple
it lay on top like a mistake
your taste buds awoke and overtake
the joy of pizza with pineapple in it

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco

[Verse 3]
you say it's a sin but I don
t see the harm in it I say
but if you did try it well really what's it
to you there's a flavor in every
bite it doesn't matter iffy
or savory pineapple on pizza it

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco

[Verse 4]
I tried my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste but I tried to touch
the crust and sauce and cheese and such with pineap
ple but all in vain the taste was
lost the sweet and sour clutches
of pineapple on pizza left me cold and

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no pozo
pineapple no no no vero
pineapple no no no verno
pineapple no no no verco
pineapple no no no nano
pineapple no no no noxso
pineapple no no no no no

[Outro]
pineapple no no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I've walked this door
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pineapple on the mar
gherita but now itamar
gherita's joy is broken with pineapple in

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I chugoku
the holy grail was moving too
and every bite we drew was pineapple in

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a taste above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to hate on someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cheer that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken pineapple on
