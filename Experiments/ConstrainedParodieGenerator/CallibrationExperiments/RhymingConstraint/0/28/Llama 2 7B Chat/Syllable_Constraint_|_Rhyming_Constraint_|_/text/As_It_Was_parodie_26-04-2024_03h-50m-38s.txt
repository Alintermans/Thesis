[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza should not be seen or

[Verse 1]
don't put it
it's not a fruit that belongs
on a pie that's hot and cheesy too soon or
it'll make a mess and ruin
the flavor of
the sauce and the cheese and the meat
can't you see it's just not
right for pineapple on a pizza please

[Chorus]
it's not the same as it
was in the old days when pizza was
just cheese and sauce and pe
toppings that made sense and tauruses
it's not the same asia
it's not the same as it

[Verse 2]
it's a fruit that
belongs on a plate orcutt
not on a pie that's meant to be a treat
it's a crime against human
ity to put
pineapple on a pizza and
call it a meal or a treat
it's just not the same as it was in the old

[Chorus]
it's not the same as it
was in the old days when pizza was
just cheese and sauce and pe
toppings that made sense and tauruses
it's not the same asia
it's not the same as it

[Bridge]
go back in time when pizza was simple
and pineapple was just a dream or a vision or
a fantasy of a tropical is
land far away from the cheese and the sauce and the meat

[Outro]
so
pineapple
on a pizza should not beierle
as it was inertial
