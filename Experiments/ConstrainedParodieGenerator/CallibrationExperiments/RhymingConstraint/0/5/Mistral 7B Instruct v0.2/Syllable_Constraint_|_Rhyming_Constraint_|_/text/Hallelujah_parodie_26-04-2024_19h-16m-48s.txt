[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret fruit
that pizza chefs refused to impute
but you don't really care for taste I betta
it goes like this the first the sixth
the bitter fall the sweetest lift
the baffled palate pondering pineapple

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 2]
your preference strong but you needed
proof that pineapple belated
her flavor in the oven overthrew ya
they added it to your pizza
they sliced your peace and they defina
and from your plate they drew the hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 3]
you say I spoke the name in vain
I don't even know the name
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a blaze of flavor in every
strange topping heard oratory
the savory or the sweet hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Verse 4]
I did my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste so I tried to touch
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of cu
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free
hallelujah pineapple free

[Outro]
hallelujah pineapple free

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this dish I've tasted more
I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your flag on the pepperon
love is not a victory dish
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going undergo
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I sisulu
the holy topping wasiyu
and every bite we drew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who hashemite
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
