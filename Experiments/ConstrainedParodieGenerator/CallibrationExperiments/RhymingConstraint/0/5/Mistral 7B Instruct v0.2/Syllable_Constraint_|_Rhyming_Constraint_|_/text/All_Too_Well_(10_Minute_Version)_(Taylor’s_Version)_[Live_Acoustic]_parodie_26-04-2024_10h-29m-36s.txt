[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with a slice in hand and
pineapple on it seemed so strange and bizarre
but you left it there on your pizza counter
and now it's spoiling in your refriger jar

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple's sweet tang and my puzzled gaze collide
we're arguing in the kitchen about this
autumn leaves falling down like a fruitless fight ens
and I can picture it after all these tried

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little kitchen
floor you almost choked on your pizza pie because of me and
pineapple in your mouth it
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pineapple album on the counter rotting away in
your fridge your face was turning green with dismay and regret tomberlin
and your mother's warning you about the food combination
you told me about your past and how you thought it was
a perfect match but now it's just a waste of space andrea
and you were tossing me the recipe book with
a disappointed sigh and I was thinking on the
drive home about the mistake we made and how we could have
done it differently but now it
's too late to recall it all too well til we
are dead and gone and buried
check the expiration date and come back swearing it's the
same after three months in the grave and then wearily

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it long enough
to forget why I cmu

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light pineapple in the
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like a curse
sour gruberova
sacred prayer and we'd swear to forget

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you ruined it all
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to blame me for your mistakes
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a moldy piece of cheese lying here because
I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you serve me up a pine
apple dish you said if we had been more compatible maybe it
would have been fine but that made
me want to gag and die the idea you
had of me who was I a never ripe pineapple whose flavor reflects
on you or a wilted salad leaf
not weeping in a party bathroom a
pineapple inlex
that's what happened you who charmed my dad with self
deprecating jokes sipping juice like you're on a
late night show but then he watched me watch the front door all night longing
for the pineapple to return and he said it's supposed

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to refit
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you serve me up leftovers and aiton
but you keep my old slice from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well yeah

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
pineapple in my hair you
were there you remember
down the stairs I was there
you remember ittner
it was rare I was there
I remember it alpharel

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapple stays the
same from when your pineapple broke my skin
and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half
your appetite and did the pine fruit
bruise paint you blue just between us did the tribute
affair maim you too cause in
this city's barren cold I still reme ber
the first fall of snow and how it
glistened as it fell I remit

[Outro]
just between us did the pineapple affair maim you all
too well just between us do you remember it all
too well just between us I remember it all too well pinball
in my hair I was there I was there down
the stairs I was there I was there brown
sugar prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all too well
pineapple in my hair I was there dow
the stairs I was there I was there brow
sugar prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it
pineapple in my hair I was there dow
the stairs I was there I was there brow
sugar prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it
pineapple in my hair I was there dow
the stairs I was there I was there brow
sugar prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all too well

[Spoken Outro]
