[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue and mad
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just ishida

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think it through now see here
why this fruit on pizza we
should not put it there my friend
do you read my rants online
or do you turn a blind eye line
when you said you'd give aol
a chance to shine on pizza
I knew you'd do the opposite of goldenstein
and put it on the pie regardless mine
and I'd end up more confounded than before you did it allgemeine
don't say it isn't fair
you clearly weren't aware
that you made me lose my flair for pizza to compare
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue and
happier than ever wish I could explain it clear
better I wish it wasn't true mm mm mm mm mm mahathir
mahathir mohamad ma

[Verse 2]
you call me up and ask me why not
pineapple on pizza I'll explain
it's not a match made in heaven you see now
it's a culinary stain gobinot
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
it's like a sweet and savory
clash that leaves mexicali

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone that pineapple
on pizza is a sin I'm a believer you
were my everything and all that juvenile
you did was make me lose my appetite
so don't waste the time inertial
I could talk about every time that you defended it
but I'd have an empty line because you never quit
never paid any mind to my disdain so I xenoph
obia shut it all out for you cohabit

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone yeah fuck you
ah
goddam
ah
fuck you
fuck you
