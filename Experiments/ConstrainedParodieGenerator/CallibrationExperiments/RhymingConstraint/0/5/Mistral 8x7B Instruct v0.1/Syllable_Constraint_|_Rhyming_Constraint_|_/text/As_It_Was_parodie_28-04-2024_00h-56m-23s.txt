[Intro]
come on now folks and give an ear to me today

[Verse 1]
taste is key yet
pineapple's ruining it
place it on a slice and watch it all go wrong
why can't people just stick to
cheese and pepper
it's a fruit that just hasler
doesn't belong on pizza
it's a sinful error oh oh oh au

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this dish it's justus
you know it's not the same pasillas
as it was ohara
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
ham and pineapple downfall
why put it on a pie at all margher
it's a disgrace to pizza
just a waste of
tomato sauce and mozzarell
it's a monstrous creation
that should never have happened oh oh oh au

[Chorus]
in this dish it's just us
you know it's not the same as it was
in this dish it's justus
you know it's not the same pasillas
as it was ohara
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home and bake a better pie instead
don't wanna talk about the way that it spreads like
a plague on pizzerias everywhere
I don't wanna talk about who's ordering it

[Outro]
he
in this dish
you know it's not the same italish
as it was ohara
