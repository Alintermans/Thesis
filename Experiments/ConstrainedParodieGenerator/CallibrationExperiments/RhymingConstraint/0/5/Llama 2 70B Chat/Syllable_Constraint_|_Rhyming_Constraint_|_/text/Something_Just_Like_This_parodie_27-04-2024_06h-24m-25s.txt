[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for
a long time now it's true
I've tried alligator
and chicken too igu
but one topping that
I just can't abide
is pineapple it's just not right it ruins the taste

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no pignataro
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza incomplete
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo oahu
doo doo doo pettigrew
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo do
I want something juju
like pelekunu
doo doo doo marylou
doo doo doo doo doo doo do do
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
of old and new igu
the legends andretti
and the myths too igu
the testaments they told
the moon and its eclipse
but pineapple on pizza no way that's just

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
not what I'm looking for no way
she said where d'you want to
go how much you want to risk I
I'm not looking for something
that's just aaa
no pineapple ups
no hawaiian downs igu
just something that tulips

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo oahu
doo doo doo marylou
doo doo doo doo doo doo dobis
I want something juju
like pelekunu
doo doo doo mikidu

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no pignataro
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza incomplete
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
