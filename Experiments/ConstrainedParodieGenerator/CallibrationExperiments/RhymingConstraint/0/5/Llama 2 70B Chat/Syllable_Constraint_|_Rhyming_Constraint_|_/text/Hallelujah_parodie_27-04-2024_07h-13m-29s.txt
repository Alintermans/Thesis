[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on aol
but I don't really care for their opinion
it's just not right no matter how
you slice it up or serve it with
it's a flavor that just doesn't fit in with

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 2]
your taste buds may be confused but mine
are not so easily susswein
I need some cheese and tomato sauce not fruit
on my pie that's just the truth I
can't be convinced otherwise I
stand by my beliefs hallelujah ia

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 3]
you say I'm closed minded and a
flavor snob well maybe that's true
but when it comes to pizza toppings I'm a
purist through and through I don't want to
try your tropical pizana
I'll stick with the classics hallelujah va

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 4]
I know you think you're being bold
and adventurous with your potho
but to me it's just a faux pas no doubt a
culinary sin that can't
be forgiven so rosengrant
I'll pass on the pineapple pizza thank you

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola
hallelujah hialeah
pineapple on pizzeria
hallelujah hagiwara
pineapple on pumilia
hallelujah hacienda
pineapple on put tanaka
hallelujah hamanaka

[Outro]
hallelujah hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
I know you think you're being
different and unique snowing
me your pineapple pizza ways but to me
it's just a fad that needs to fade away
like a bad perm or paragu
it's not a flavor that I'll ever crave so please

[Additional Lyrics]
I remember when pizza was
just cheese and sauce and maybe some
pepperoni or sausage not a fruit sal
ad on a crust that's just not what bal
ances the flavors rationale
it's not a taste that I'll ever acquire so

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a pizza to
pping that you love that iou
don't understand but that's okay we all
have our own tastes and preferences
but pineapple on pizza itches
me it's just not something that I'll ever accept
