[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is
a topping that's just not right in my eyesaid it's a crime
do you ever get that feeling that you
can't shift the tide of disgust
are there some toppings up your sleeve that you
haven't tried to make it more bearable to chewsa
I've dreamt about pineapple ju
how many secrets
can you keep before you start to spewsaid it's a fad that's just
not worth the hype it's given in the media

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from the che
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for toppings that donaway

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
origin of the pizza
ever thought of
callin' ita
too badia
busy bein' wrong
to fall for something newby
now I thoughtfully
crawlin' back toya

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been wonderin' if your toppings are still
open and if so I wanna know what time
it shutscaused I'm constantly on the cusp of throwin
it in the trash where it belongsa said it's a crime that's just
not worth the calories it's given in theorist
I've dreamt about pineapple juice and cheesiest

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from the che
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go

[Outro]
