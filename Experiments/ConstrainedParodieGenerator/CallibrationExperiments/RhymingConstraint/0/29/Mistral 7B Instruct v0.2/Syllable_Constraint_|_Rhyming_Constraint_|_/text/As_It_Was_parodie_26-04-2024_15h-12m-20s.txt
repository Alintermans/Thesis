[Intro]
come on folks gather round and let me say this true

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's flavor marathon
I want you to hold out the line and refuse
why don't we leave it alone
no place for taste
when texture clashes interlaced
it seems you cannot be first
and I'm the one who'll protest oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of food we
know it's not the same as it used to
in this world ofc
know it's not the same asamera
as it was piechota
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple lovers mayall
why are you insisting on this allure
what kind of palate are you
ringing the bell
and pizza purists come to help
your taste buds live alone they
just want to know that their meal's well oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of food we
know it's not the same as it used to
in this world ofc
know it's not the same asamera
as it was piechota
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home try new dishes fast internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave tradition behind two chefs follow
I don't wanna talk about who's innovating

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was ohara
