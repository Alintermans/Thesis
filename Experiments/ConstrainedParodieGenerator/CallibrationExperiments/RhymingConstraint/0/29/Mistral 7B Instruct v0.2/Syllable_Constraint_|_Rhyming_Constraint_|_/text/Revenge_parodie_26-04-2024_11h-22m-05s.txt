[Intro]
I think I've made a grave mistake or
placed a fruit on a dish that's a
pineapple on a pizza error
pineapple's not a savvy
composer

[Verse]
I've ordered pies with ham and pe
ppers and olives galore but now I see austerity
oh pineapple pie in paradise
if I could take it back I'd hide it from your
eyes oh man what a world the things
we put on our pies if I could act on my dislike
and remove it from your slice it's not a
delight it's not a spice it's not a nice surprise oh man what
a world the things we dolecki
fruit on our pies and you'd have thought that I would let it
go and let you choose but iodice
pineapple breaks the harmony sofamor
I've ordered pies with chitterlings
and anchovies and jalape√±os but now I vandy
see a grave mistake in ourada
if I could act on my dislike and remove it farragut

[Chorus]
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rototot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rosselot
in my grave I'll rot

[Outro]
in my grave I'll rot
I'll rot rot kennecott
is my taste your freedom
is all of my taste your freedom
enjoy
