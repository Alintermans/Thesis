[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the pie
seas of cheese would rise when I gave
now in the morning I eat alone
sweep the plates I used to own

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my palate's eyes
listen as the crowd would sigh
now the old king of taste is deify
one minute I held the cheese
next the pineapple defries
and I discovered that my pizzas stand
on pillars of disdain and disappointment

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear controversy bells a ringin
pizza purists voices ritalin
be my mirror reflecting truth
my toppings in a culinary booth
for some reason I can't explain
once you'd gone there was never
never an honest bite
and that was when I ruled the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild pine
blew down the doors to let it in
shattered flavors and the sound of gro
people couldn't believe what I'd become
pineapple revolution
waits for my head on ackerman
just a topping on a lonely string mmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmh
aw who would ever wanna be king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear controversy bells a ringin
pizza purists voices ritalin
be my mirror reflecting truth
my toppings in a culinary booth
for some reason I can't explain
I know the food police won't call your
name but never an dish
that was when I ruled the pie ight
