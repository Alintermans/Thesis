[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on aol
but I don't really care for their opinion
it's just not right no matter how
you slice it up or serve it with
it's a flavor that just doesn't fit in with

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 2]
your taste buds may be confused but mine
are not so easily susswein
I need some cheese and tomato sauce not fruit
on my pie that's just the truth I
can't be convinced otherwise it
just don't taste good no matter the portion

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 3]
you say I'm closed minded and a
flavor snob well maybe that's true
but when it comes to pizza toppings I'm a
purist through and through I don't want to
try your hawaiian pandora
pineapple has no place on a pizza stone

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 4]
I know you think it's a nice com
bination but to me it's aplomb
I'll take my pizza with pepperoni or
sausage but pineapple no way
it's just not right it's bta
not broken hallelujah hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola
hallelujah hialeah
pineapple on pizzeria
hallelujah hilaria
pineapple on pumilia
hallelujah hysteria
pineapple on pachysandra
hallelujah ponderosa

[Outro]
pineapple on pizza no way

[Additional Lyrics]
I know you think it's a fun
topping to try but toboggan
it's just not worth the calories or the shame
it's a flavor that's just not worth the game
and remember when we used to
eat pizza the way it's meant to be eaten as

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a pizza topping
that you love but I donating
anchovies or artichokes or maybe ol
ives but pineapple no methanol
it's just not right it's aven
not a flavor that's heaven sent anelehla

[Additional Lyrics]
I don't know what the ha
waiians do but pineapple ona
pizza that's just not what I'm looking for a
nd I won't be convinced otherwise
even if you try to hellenize
it's just not right it's a gastronomic lie an
