[Verse 1]
pizza that's the question that
we all must face today pandit
or savory delicate
toppings on a pie

[Pre-Chorus]
let's consider the flavors and textures we desire
sweetness and spice and a crunchy fire burning desire

a culinary abomination a gastronomical

created was it over when the pineapp

[Bridge]
belongs in a smoothie or on a plate
not on a pie with
melted cheese and sauce oh the thought
of it makes me irate how
dare they do this to a classic how
dare they ruin a
perfectly good dish like that and
why do they insist on such
a travesty why do they

why do they insist on such a crime against humanity letourneau
