[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the fruit that ruins allaire
the topping in the pie that's sorely mis
the unsuspecting palate
of flavor in the dish that
we can't enjoy like jack and jill if we
choose not to pineapple put
and we'll have summer on our plates
and in the night we'll wish this never starts
we'll wish this never starts

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the harmony and I'm so
sorry for the taste that's lost tonight no
I crave a balance and always
this strange intrusion
comes creeping on with every bite I take
and as I chew I ponder
the texture from this piney
mess that's clinging to my tongue like a
decision to order something
else and hear the voice of the
pizza chef's defense tonight defranco
stop this pineo

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the texture inside this
disasterpiece atop
I pine for peace atop I pine forcibly
don't add your fruit to
me it's already the

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the texture inside this
disasterpiece atop
don't add your fruit to me itty
's already theorists
inside this malaprop
don't add your fruit to me itty
's already theorists
inside this gigaflop
don't add your fruit to me itty
's already theorists
inside this rasterop

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
