[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
that won't persist universe

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you judge me for my palate preference
pineapple's place is right
on a tropical paradise night
a tropical paradise sight

[Pre-Chorus]
I was puzzled by the pizza
mixing sweet with savory was a
poetic experiment for
those who'd try it or more or less ignore it all the
pineapple's defense against the
naysayers' criticism and their
disdain for this unusual
pairing of flavors so bizarre

[Chorus]
pain in my palate you caused me to
believer in pineap
pain in my taste buds you made me a
believer in pineap
pain in my pizza you break me down and build
me up believer in pineap part
pain in my pizza you madeira
believer in pineap

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the pizza gods up
above for meandered
pineapple haters and their grudges subs
pineapple peace in our tub

[Pre-Chorus]
I was once a pizza pur
but then I tried alexander
topped with pineapple and ham and
curry and jalape√±o and
pineapple's place in my heart grew stronger and stronger
no longer inhibited or limited by nederland
it's a flavor

[Chorus]
pain in my palate you caused me to
believer in pineap
pain in my taste buds you made me a
believer in pineap
pain in my pizza you break me down and build
me up believer in pineap part
pain in my pizza you madeira
believer in pineap

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the fire and the flames
you're the face of the future
pineapple on pizza's a
game changer andromeda

[Pre-Chorus]
no longer am I a pizza traditionalist
pineapple's place on my pizza is a twist that's persistent
it's a flavor

[Chorus]
pain in my palate you caused me to
believer in pineap
pain in my taste buds you made me a
believer in pineap
pain in my pizza you break me down and build
me up believer in pineap part
pain in my pizza you madeira
believer in pineap
