I'm fired up and tired of
the way that pizza's been treated

I want on my pie supreme oh oh

I was a skeptic from a young
age never thought I'd be a pizza
snob but now I'm on a mission
to spread the word of the gospel of pizza perfeck
singing from my heartache from the
pain of a bad slice taken from
my veins my message isaiah

building my rage up in the cloud
falling like slices to the ground
hoping my feelings they would brown
