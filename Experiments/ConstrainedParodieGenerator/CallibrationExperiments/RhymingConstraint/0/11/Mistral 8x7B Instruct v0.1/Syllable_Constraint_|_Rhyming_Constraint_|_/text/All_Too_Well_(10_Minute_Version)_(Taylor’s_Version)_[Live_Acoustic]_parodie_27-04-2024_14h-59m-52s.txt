[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow
the slimy fruit mixed with cheese and tomato
I spit it out and now I'll tell you why it

[Verse 2]
should never be on a pizza pie they say it's fine
but I say it's a crime against pizza and
your taste buds too it's just not meant to be on a
pizza pie no matter what anyone may

[Pre-Chorus]
argue or say it's just not
the way pizza was meant to
be enjoyed no sane person would choose it over
classic to

[Chorus]
ppings like pepperoni or sausage and mush
rooms and onions it just doesn't belong on a pizza pie
pizza is sacred and pine
apple does not fit the bill so

[Verse 3]
think twice before you add it to your slice it's not a good
idea and you'll regret it once you take a bite it overdid
its welcome on the pizza scene and it's time to say goodbye
to pineapple on pizza forever it's just not
right so let's all agree to disagree and move on aucott
tumni leaves falling down like pieces into place
and I can picture it after all these days without
pineapple on pizza it's just not the same so let's all
remember it all too well and
move on from this tragic tale of pineapple
on pizza it's just not meant
to be so let's all agree to disagree and enjoy
our pizza the way it was meant to beierle
