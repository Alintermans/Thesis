[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I wasiyu
the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who' selenite
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
