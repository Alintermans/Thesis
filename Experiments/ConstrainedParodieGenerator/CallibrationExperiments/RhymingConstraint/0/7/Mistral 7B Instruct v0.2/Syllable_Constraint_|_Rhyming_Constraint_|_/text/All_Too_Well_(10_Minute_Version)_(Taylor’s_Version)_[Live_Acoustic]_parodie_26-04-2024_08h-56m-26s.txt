[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with a slice in hand and
pineapple on it seemed so strange and bizarre
but you left it there on your pizza counter
and now it's spoiling in your refrigerate

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple's sweet tang and my puzzled gaze collide
we're arguing in the kitchen about this
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
but I can't picture it after allied

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red because you were looking at that fruit
wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pineapple album on the countertop turning brown and
your face was turning green with every bite you'd taken on your own
and your mother's telling stories about the pineapple pie
you told me about your past thinking it was a del
and you were tossing me the slice keys saying let's skip this town
and I was thinking on the drive down any time
he's gonna say it's love but you never called it what
it was til we were dead and gone and buried in the ground
'til we were dead and gone and buried
check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
after three months in the grave
and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
but all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
sacred prayer and we'd swear
to remember it all too well yeah

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you tore it all up
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in taste maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to pine
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever loving jewel whose shine reflects on you or
not weeping in a party bathroom
some actress asking me whatsoever
that's whatsoever
you who charmed my dad with self deprecating
jokes sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come
and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twenty one

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old slice from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well yeah

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your toppings stay the same
from when your pineapple broke my skin and
bones I'm a soldier who's returning half your
weight and did the pineapple bruise paint
you blue just between us did the love affair main
you too cause in this city
's barren cold I still remember the first
fall of snow and how it glistened
as it fell I remember it

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well wind in my hair
I was there down the stairs I was there sac
red prayer I was there I was there it
was rare you remember it all too
well wind in my hair I was there down the stairs
I was there sacred prayer I was there it
was rare you remember it all too
well wind in my hair I was there down
the stairs I was there sacred prayer
I was there it was rare you remember
it all too well wind In my hair I
was there down the stairs I was there sac
red prayer I was there it wassmer
are you remember it all too well wind
in my hair I was there down the stairs
I was there sacred prayer I was there
it was rare you remember it all too well

[Spoken Outro]
