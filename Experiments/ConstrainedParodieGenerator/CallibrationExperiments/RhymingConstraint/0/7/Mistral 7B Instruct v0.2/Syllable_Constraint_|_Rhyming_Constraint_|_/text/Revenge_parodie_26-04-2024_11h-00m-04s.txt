[Intro]
I think I've made a grave mistake or
placed a fruit on a dish that's a
pineapple on a pizza error
pineapple's not a savvy
topper for

[Verse]
I've ordered pies with pineapple
can't pretend that I'm a gourmet eater leaving you
in disbelief and awe of this cul
tural blunder oh man what a world the things
I've tasted if I could act on
my disdain no would I add this fruit to my plate again
pineapple on a pizza causes a
divide and I don't wanna compromise so in my heart
I'll pine for the days ofarrell
I'll pine for the days ofarrell oh man what aerial
the things I've tasted if I could act
on my disdain no would I add this fruit to
my plate again pineapple on
a pizza causes a divide and I don't wanna
compromise so in my heart I'll pine for
the days of old where pizzas were pure and bold without pineap

[Chorus]
in my heart I'll pine
in my heart I'll pine
in my heart I'll pine pine pine
in my heart I'll pine
in my heart I'll pine pine pine
in my heart I'll pine

[Outro]
in my heart I'll pine
I'll pine pine pine I'll pine
is my preference your
delight is all of my dismore
your joy
