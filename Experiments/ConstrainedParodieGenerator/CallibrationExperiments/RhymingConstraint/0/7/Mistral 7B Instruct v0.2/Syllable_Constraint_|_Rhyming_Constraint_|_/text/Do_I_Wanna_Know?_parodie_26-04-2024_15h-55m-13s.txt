[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clings like something in
the middle of your slice and makes
your taste buds recoil and pine for something
more refined than this tropical combination's scheme
how many palates cancelling
'cause there's this dish I found
that makes me think of food gone wrong an' I serve it on repeat
until I'm full and groan in disbelief at what

[Pre-Chorus]
is this flavor's fate if we both partake in this
unconventional pairing that's hard to take away
we both know that the nights were made for trying new
combinations but this one's a recipe foray

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to cheese
ever thought of ordering
when you've hades
I always do
maybe I'm too
addicted to the
normality of pizza
now I've thought it through
crawlin' back toby

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been pondering if your preference still
remains and if so I wanna know what time
it shuts down and sets the stage for a culinary du
but I don't know if you feel the same as I do about
this controversial topping that's been causing a stir
but we could be satisfied if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
is this flavor's fate if we both partake in this
unconventional pairing that's hard to take away
we both know that the nights were made for trying new
combinations but this one's a recipe foray

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to cheese crawlin' back to cheese
ever thought of ordering
when you've had aphrodite
I always do I always dobies
maybe I'm too busy being normal
to fall for this exotic fruit
now I've thought it through crawlin
back toscanini
outro nic

[Outro]
is this flavor's fate if we both partake in this
unconventional pairing that's hard to take away
we both know that the nights were made for trying new
combinations but this one's a recipe foray
is this flavor's fate too busy being normal to
fall for this exotic fruit ever thought of calling
is this flavor's fate do you want me crawlin' back to you
