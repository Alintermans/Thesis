[Verse 1]
twenty five years with this strange
tryin' to figure out why pineapple on
a pizza is such a
mystery to me and you know I've tried
to understand this bizarre brotherhood of mankind
for the love of pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm taking a bite
just to get it all out what's in my mind
and I feel a little peculiar with each slice
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's the reason

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey heyday
I said hey what's the reason for
this pineapple on a
hey hey hey
hey heyday again andover

[Bridge]
ooh o

ooh uh u
ooh o

ooh uh u

[Verse 2]
and I pine
oh my god dobberstein
I pine all the time
in this kitchen of life
and I ple
oh my god doolittle
I plead every single day
for no pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm taking a bite
just to get it all out what's in my mind
and I feel a little peculiar with each slice
and so I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's the reason

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey heyday
I said hey what's the reason
for this pineapple on
hey hey hey
hey heyday again andean
hey hey hey nowaday
I said hey what's the reason for this
pineapple
hey hey hey heyday again andeat

[Outro]
twenty five years with this strange
tryin' to figure out why pineapple on
a pizza is such a pain
