caught in a debate with reason and decapua
open your eyes and see the truth soberly
I'm just a pizza lover andromeda
because pineapple does not belong on a pizza and that

[Verse 1]
mama mia why do
you put pineapple on a pizza when cheese is the king
it's like putting ketchup on
a steak it just don't make sense to me
mama mia I beg to differ it
ain't no hawaiian pizza this is just
italian cuisine at its finest not some tropical

[Verse 2]
fusion of flavors that
clashes like a cacophony of dissonance in
my ears it's like a crime against human
pizza and pineapple don't go hand in
hand like peanut butter and jelly
mama mia I'm begg
ing you to reconsider your topping choice
