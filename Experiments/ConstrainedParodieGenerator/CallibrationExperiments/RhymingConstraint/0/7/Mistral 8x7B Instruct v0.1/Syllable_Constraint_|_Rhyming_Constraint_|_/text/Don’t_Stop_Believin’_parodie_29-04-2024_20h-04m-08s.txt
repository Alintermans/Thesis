[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and tom
just a foodie born and raised in new york city
pizza lover on a quest to find the bomb

[Verse 2]
a slice in a crowded pizzer
topped with pineapple and hammy
for a taste they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza haters
lining up the block in dis
their scorn searching in the light of
streetlights shining
on the crime of pineapple on
a pizza pie tonight oh

[Verse 3]
working hard to get a taste
everybody wants a sav
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will win with pepper
some will lose with pinegar
oh the outrage never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza haters
lining up the block in dis
their scorn searching in the light of
streetlights shining
on the crime of pineapple on
a pizza pie tonight oh

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating on
pineapple on pizza
streetlights shining
don't stop hollomon
hold on
streetlights shining
don't stop hambleton
hold on toquepala
streetlights shining
