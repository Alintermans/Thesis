[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
its taste is a cursea bitter
on a slice it does not belong
on a slice it does not belong

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare put it on my dish out spicy
its texture ruins the
harmony of cheese and tomato
harmony of cheese andino

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet pure
pizza was sacred and so sure now
it's tainted by this sweet fruit's reign
I can't abide by this trendy campaign feeling
betrayed by this culinary
travesty that's driving me ins
ane seeing the disunity
of flavors clashing in my brain

[Chorus]
pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice
believer I cannot
pain you've brought me to a breaking point now oh
my taste buds scream in protest so loud
pain you've put me through with pineal
believer I cannot

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a plea to the chefs up above
all the hate uncovered
for pineapple on a pizza cover
on a pizza cover upshur

[Pre-Chorus]
I was wincing at the sight
of pineapple chunks satterwhite
on my once perfect pizza night
but now I've found my appetite
won't rest until it's set right side up again and
I'll fight for what I know is true and plain to see thatcherite
is not the way

[Chorus]
pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice
believer I cannot
pain you've brought me to a breaking point now oh
my taste buds scream in protest so loud
pain you've put me through with pineal
believer I cannot

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the pizza gods above
you're the face of the future
the taste in my mouth I love
the taste in my mouth I love

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll keep fighting for what's right and true and plain to see
that pineapple's got no place on a pizza for me or you
and I'll keep on

[Chorus]
pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice
believer I cannot
pain you've brought me to a breaking point now oh
my taste buds scream in protest so loud
pain you've put me through with pineal
believer I cannot
