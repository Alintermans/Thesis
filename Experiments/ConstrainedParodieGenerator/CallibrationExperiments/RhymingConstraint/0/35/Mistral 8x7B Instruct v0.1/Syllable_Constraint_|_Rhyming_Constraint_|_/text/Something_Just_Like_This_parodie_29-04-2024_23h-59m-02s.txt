[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni andries
and bbq with a
cheese that's all aflow
but pineapple just won
through to me it doesn't belong on a pizza gone

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said where d'you wanna go
how far will you pursue
I'm not looking for a slice that
is too exotic and new
just something savo
ry and tasty too
something I can share with you
something I amadou
want something just like this do

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo do do
doo doo doo do daewo
oh I want something just like this
doo doo do oahu
doo doo do dentsu
doo doo do devere
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
margherita andries
and hawaiian too but
pineapple just won't
do on a pizza pie
it's just not meant to be on a savory

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk I
'm not looking for a slice that's too
exotic and new just som
ething savory
and tasty too som
ething I can share with you
something I can sriram

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo do dentsu
doo doo do oahu
oh I want something just like this
doo doo do devere
doo doo do sassou
doo doo do devere

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a slice that
is too exotic and new
just something savo
ry and tasty too
something I can share with you
something I can kiss o
h I want something just like

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
