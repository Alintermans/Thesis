[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice foot
now in the morning I take a bite
of a pizza thatcherite

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to love the taste
but now it's ruined by the pine's
juicy sweetness overpow
ers the savory sauce andriano
one bite and I held my breath
next I spit it out in death
and I discovered that my slice's base
is built on bad taste and disgrace cityplace

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disgust a ringin
pineapple lovers loudly singin
be my enemy and my spite
my reason to never eat thatcherite
for some reason I can't explain
once I tasted it there was
never a peace of mind
and that was when pineapple was

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
on my pizza like a sinful
blowin' away the taste I knew
cheese and sauce and pepperoni too
just a mess on a plate for me and you
revolutionaries wait
for my head to turn inundate
just a victim of a culinary fate
aw who would ever wanna eat that

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disgust a ringin
pineapple lovers loudly singin
be my enemy and my spite
my reason to never eat thatcherite
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't call my name
never a peace of mind
but that was when pineapple was

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
hear the bells of disgust
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
ringin' in deforest
oh oh oh oh oh oh ohio
pineapple lovers sing
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
be my enemy and
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh owosso
my reason to dearest
for some reason I can't explain
oh oh oh oh callous
I know saint peter won't call my name
never a peace of mind
but that was when pineapple was
