[Intro]
is this a bad pie or just a delusion
pineapple on pizza causing quite the confusion
look at this monstrosity andonian
I'm just a poor soul who needs no halligan
easy to add but ruins the dough's highs and lows anyway
the wind blows hard against this pizza abomination wayman

[Verse 1]
mama mia I just
topped a pizza with fruit I now regret it must confess
mama life had just begun
but now I've gone and ruined it all with
mama oh no I didn't mean to make
you cringe like this with this pineapple fake news
just carry on and order a new one like it never

[Verse 2]
has come too late my taste
pineapple on pizza sends shivers down my taste bud
goodbye to the pizza I once loved so
gotta leave it all behind and taste the truth
mama oh no I don't wanna
eat this anymore and
wish I'd never tried it at all no no no

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little slice of pizza with pine
scaramouche scaramouche will you try the fandango
thunderbolt and lightning ruins the taste so frightening
galileo galileo will you let me go no no no no no no no no no no no ohio
I'm just a poor soul who needs no hollering
he's just a poor soul from a poor homecoming
spare him his pizza from this monkeying

beelzebub has a devil fruit put aside for meandering

[Verse 4]
