[Intro]
come on pineapple lovers we wanna say good

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's holdin' pantheon
I want you to hold out the pie in your hand
why don't we leave it plain che
nothin' to say
when the toppings get allende
seems you cannot be replaced
and the flavor's gonna stay oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world pizza's just
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world pessimist
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple's no good atoll
why are you sitting at home on the floor
what kind of toppings are you
ringin' the bell
and nobody's comin to help
your taste buds live by themselves
they just want to know that you're well oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world pizza's just
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world pessimist
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home get ahead try a new reci
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave pineapple behind follow your taste
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
