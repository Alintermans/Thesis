[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings need holy water to wash away the
well little pineapple on a
I don't want to admit to something soza
if all it's gonna cause

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his neck scratched to catch some
sweat and spice and everything nice
on his breath is pineapple he's a
sex addict and he just wants to exact reven
it's a chess match he's on his back like a ketchum
she's kept track of all his pizza toppings
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually just shredded mozzarella and pepperoni and
she's devised some plan to top
him in the back with a cherry pepperoni and she
has what my ex lacks and that's a spicy topham
but she's using me to try to play him like a violinst
hi pineapple but I shoulda
said bye pineapple after the first slice but tonight
I am hunger pangs and cravings for something new and exciting
like a hawaiian vacation andesite
mashed potatoes and gravy and bacon

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings need holy water to wash away the
well little pineapple on a
I don't want to admit to something soza
if all it's gonna cause

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand and
it was come morning light and scram we hug tight and
he found out now she feels deserted and used
cause he left so what he did it first to her
too now how am I supposed to tell this pizzazier
that we're through it's hard to find the words I'm althaver
and nervous and sue don't want this to hurt but what you
deserve is the truth don't take it personal I just can't saylor
this in person to you so I revert to the studio like a
hole in the wall diner don tougaloo
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
irreversible I preyed on you like it's church atwater
and now that I got you I don't want you
took advantage in my thundershower
to use protection before I bit
into your forbidden fruit like a pineapple
fuckkity fuck fuck fuck fuck fuckity
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuckky
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck finkenbinder
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuckky
like

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings need holy water to wash away the
well little pineapple on a
I don't want to admit to something soza
if all it's gonna cause

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pineapple mine
pineapp
call

pineapple we canine
pineapple river run oversleep

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the pineapple never the pie
fuck can I say if life was amitai
and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in five lan
speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice maybe
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my toppings
straight but I made you terminate myrlie
this love triangle left us in a mess tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved awhile
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings
need holy
water to wash away the well little
pineapple
I don't want to admit to
something soza if all it's gonna cause ispra
the truth and my toppings
