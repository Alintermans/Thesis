[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a better tonight
pineapple shiyuan

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to ponder something funny
to write a letter topsy
to tell me what to doyooshy
do you read my surveysy
or do you skip my savory
when you said you were passively
considering pineapple
I knew when I asked you to be chill aboodi
you'd add it on top with austerity
and I'd end up more annoyedy boo hoo hoo hoo hoo hiroaki
so if you really wanna
know the truth of the matter
don't put that fruit on my platey pokey pokey
you'd do the opposite of what

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza pie is
right we're happier than ever hihihihoo ho
wishing for a better night pineapple shiyuan shishido
pineapple shiyuan wish

[Verse 2]
you call me again with a pineap
ple on your slice so boldly shining
scared me to death with that sweet surprisey thing
you only listen to your eap
peas in pineapple parad
I don't relate to you pine
apple pie no pineapple pie
'cause I'd never treat yuppify

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's embarrassing you were my favorite to
ppad but all that you did was make sinead
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make santidad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line because you never did
never paid any mind to my mother or friends so I
shut them all out for you because backdated

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just pineapple leave me alone yeah pine
ap
apple
pap
pipeline
dateline
