livin' in a lonely world of cheese and sau
she took the midnight train goin' anywhere but
not to pineapple on a pizza inlaw

up and down the pizza box
their toppings searchin' in the night
cheese and sauce and
livin' just to find a flavor
hidin' somewhere in airtight

their toppings searchin' in the night
cheese and sauce and
livin' just to find a flavor
hidin' somewhere in airtight
