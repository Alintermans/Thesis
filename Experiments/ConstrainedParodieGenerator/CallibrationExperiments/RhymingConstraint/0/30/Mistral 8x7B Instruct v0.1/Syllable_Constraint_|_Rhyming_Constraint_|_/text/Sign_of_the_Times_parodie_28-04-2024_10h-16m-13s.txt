[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we
must face this culinary war
you might think it's tasty but it's a flawed notion
it looks absurd on a pie
it's just not right my friend oh

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but aversions
remain and we're still surprised axiom
of pizza andoras

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
reject this sweet invasion thrust
on our beloved pizza pies we must
get away from this trend we desp
it's a sign of the bitterest

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice with a grin on
it's a sign of the times we
must unite against this food
that's just not meant to be on a pizza
we can find a better way
to enjoy our allude

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but aversions
remain and we're still surprised axiom
of pizza andoras

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
reject this sweet invasion thrust
on our beloved pizza pies we must get
away from this trend we despise
it's a sign of the bitterest

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but aversions
remain and we're still surprised axiom
of pizza andoras

[Bridge]
we don't taste enough
we should explore and
expand our pizza
before it's all too
much and we regret
what we allowed on

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on we
must get away from this
we got to get away from this trend onassis
we got to get away from this sin elexis
we got to get away andis
we got to get away andis
we got to get away anthis
