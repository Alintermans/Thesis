[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to love pizza
toppings would pile high and higher
but now it's just a memory slice
cause pineapple overprice

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to be the king
of the pizza scene but now I'm just
a peasant with a slice that
can't compete with the crown pussycat
one minute I held the che
ese next it was aaa
gone with the wind and my dignity too
pillars of salt and pillars of mashalu

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pizza bells a ringin' roman
cavalry choirs are sing inboden
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a stonyfield
for some reason I can't explain
once you've gone there's never an
honest slice and that's when
I ruled the pizza world pizza

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered slices and the sound of drums
people couldn't believe what I'd become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silverplate
just a puppet on a lonely string mmmm yeah
who would ever wanna be king of

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pizza bells a ringin' roman
cavalry choirs are sing inboden
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a stonyfield
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint pizza won't call my name
never an honest slice
but that was when I ruled the world

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh

my missionaries in
a stonyfield for some reason
I can't ex
plain I know saint pizza won't callan
name never anzio
