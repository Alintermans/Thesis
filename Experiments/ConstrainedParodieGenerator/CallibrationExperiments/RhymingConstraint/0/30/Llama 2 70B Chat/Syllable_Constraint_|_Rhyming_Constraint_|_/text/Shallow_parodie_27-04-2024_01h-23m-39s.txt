[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me somethin
is pineapple on your pizza fine
or do you need more
like a flavor that's truly divine

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm callin
in all the good slices I find myelin
for change
and in the bad times I fear my taste

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me somethin
boy arent you tired of that hawai
ain't it hard keep
in it so tacky ain't eap

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm fallin
in all the good times I find myself yeargin
for change
and in the bad times I fear my hung

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
im off the deep end watch as I dive in
ill never touch the ground
crash through the surface where they cant hurt us we
re far from the shallot now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow in
the sha ha la la la la low in
the sha ha shallow weylin
we re far from the shall pin

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
im off the deep end watch as I dive in
ill never touch the ground
crash through the surface where they cant hurt us we
re far from the shallot now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow
in the sha ha la la lazaro
in the sh hakko
we re far from the shall pin
