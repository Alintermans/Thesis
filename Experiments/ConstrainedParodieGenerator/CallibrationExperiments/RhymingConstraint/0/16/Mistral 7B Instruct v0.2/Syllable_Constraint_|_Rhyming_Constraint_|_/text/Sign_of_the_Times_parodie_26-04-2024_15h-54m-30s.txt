[Verse 1]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
it's a mystery of the

we never order right it seems weevil

we gotta change our order
we gotta change our order
just stop your whining it'll be better
they told me that our taste bud

just stop your whining let your palate fly high
soaring through the savory

another topping somewhere

we never order right it seems weevil
can't escape the taste

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta change our order
we gotta change our order
stop your whining baby it'll be better
they told me that our taste bud
s will adapt and evander

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems we
can't escape the taste of pineapple

we never order right it seems weevil
can't escape the taste

[Bridge]

should communicate and
try new things before
it's all too late will
we ever learn to

[Outro]
just stop your whining about that pineapple we
gotta try new flavors
we gotta try new flavors we gotta try new
flavors we gotta try new flavors weinberger
