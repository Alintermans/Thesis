[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' with glee every bite you take
do you ever get that feelin' that it
just don't belong like a fruit
that's not supposed to be savory and
sticks out like a sore thumb like a hawaiian pizza
are there some flavors up your sle
that you're tryin' to
hide from me have you no idea that it's just not right how
many toppings can you combine before it's just

[Pre-Chorus]
too much do I wanna know if this topping flows
both ways sad to see you go was hopin' that you'd stay
baby we both know that pineapple don't go
with cheese in no way shape or form not today pistole

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to bas
ic pizza toppings ever
thought of addin
'em when you're inaez
cause I always
do maybe I'm too
busy lovin' pepperon
I to fall for som
ethin' new now has

[Verse 2]
you got the guts to put
pineapple on your pizza and if so
can you tell me how to make it stop afoot
simmer down and listen up I'm sorry to interrupt
but I gotta know if you feel the same way as I do that
it's just not right and we can't be together if
you insist on puttin' pineapple upmarket

[Pre-Chorus]
too much do I wanna know if this topping flows
both ways sad to see you go was hopin' that you'd stay
baby we both know that pineapple don't go
with cheese in no way shape or form not today pistole

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to bas ic pizza toppings
ever thought of addin' em
when you're in a s ewing
cause I always do maybe I'm too
busy lovin' pepperoni to fall
for somethin' new now has thought it
through crawlin' back to bas sing
the blues pizza to
ppings that is pennings

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
sad to see you go was hopin' that you'd stay baby
we both know that pineapple don't go with che
ese in no way shape or form not today pistilli
do you want me crawlin' back to bas ic pizza to
ppings that is pepperoni and sausage and mushroom
and onion and peppers and olives and bacon and anch
