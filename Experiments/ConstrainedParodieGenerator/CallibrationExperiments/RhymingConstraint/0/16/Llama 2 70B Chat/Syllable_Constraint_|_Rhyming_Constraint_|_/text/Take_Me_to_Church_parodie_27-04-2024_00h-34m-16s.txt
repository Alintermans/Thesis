[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the pineapple on top that's the
problem ain't no way topeka
should be on a pie that's meantime
if the flavors ever did speak
pineapple's the one that
makes me want to scream and seek ahmeek
every surowiec
getting more bleakaholic weekah
a fresh disgust each weekahol
we were born sick of pineapple on
pizza they say it's a sinonah
my taste buds offer noah
absolutes only pepita
she tells me worship in

[Pre-Chorus]
a hawai

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the shrine of your
lies I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharp in
your knife offer me that death
less death oh good pizza let meakin
give you myrna
take me to the pizzeria I'll worship at
the shrine of your lies I'll tell you myotrophin
and you can sharpen your breath
offer me that deathless death ohlin

[Verse 2]
if I'm a pagan of the good to
pizzas my lover's the
cheese to keep the taste on my side
she demands a sacrifice
drain the whole ocean get somethin
shiny somethin meaty for
the main course that's aulander
lookin' pineapple what you
got in the fridge ain't nothin
starvin' faithful that looks tasman
plenty this is hun

[Chorus]

pizzeria I'll worship at the shrine of your
lies I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharp in
your knife offer me that death

the shrine of your lies I'll tell you myotrophin
and you can sharpen your breath

[Bridge]
no pineapple on pizza when the meal begins
there is no sweeter taste than our gentle cravingsin
in the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
only then I am human only then I amin

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizzeria I'll worship at the shrine of your
lies I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharp in
your knife offer me that death
less death oh good pizza let meakin

the shrine of your lies I'll tell you myotrophin
and you can sharpen your breath
