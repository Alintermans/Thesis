[Intro]
come on pineapple lovers we wanna say good

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's holdin' pantheon
I want you to hold out the pie in your hand
why don't we leave it plain che
nothin' to say
when the toppings get inoue
seems you cannot be replaced
and the flavors will stay oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of food it
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of food it
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple you're no goodall
why are you sitting at home on the floor
what kind of toppings are you
ringin' the bell
and nobody's coming to help
your taste buds live by themselves
they just want to know that you're swell oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of food it
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of food it
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home get ahead try a new reci
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave the pizza alone two slices fol
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
