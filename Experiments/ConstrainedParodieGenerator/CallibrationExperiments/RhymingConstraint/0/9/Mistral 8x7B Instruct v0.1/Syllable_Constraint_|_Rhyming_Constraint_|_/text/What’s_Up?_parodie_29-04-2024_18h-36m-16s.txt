[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I tried pineapple once and knew right then
it was a culinary mistake I couldn't ab
sorb or tolerate well

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I'm at the table
just to get it off my plate aerial
abomination so vile and inedible
and I wake in the morning and I open the box
and I take a whiff and I'm hit by a shock
from the smell of this monstrosity
I say what's this

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
hey heyday
I said hey what's this on my plate
and I say hey hey hey
hey heyday
I said hey what's this abdicate

[Bridge]

and I tried
oh my god did I tied
to give pineapple
a chance and a ride and
I prayed oh

and so I groan sometimes when I'm at the table
just to get it off my plate aerial
abomination so vile and inedible
and I wake in the morning and I open the box
and I take a whiff and I'm hit by a shock
from the smell of this monstrosity
I say what's this

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey hey
