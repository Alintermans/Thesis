[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta keep it cool because I hate the pineap
it started out on a pie but now it's on a pizza
now I'm cringin' hard and my taste buds aretta
now I'm reachin' for water and she's orderin
while he's savourin' his slice and she's smorin' on
now they're sharin' a laugh and my appetite's
gone and it's all in the

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's savourin' his taste
he's relishin' the waste
let me go
'cause I just can't partake it's a taste that
and takin' control

[Chorus]
pineapple pride turning food into the
swimmin' through savory lies
chokin' on your justifies
but it's just the price I pay
destiny islamiya
open up my sensitize
'cause I'm mr inop

[Guitar Solo]
