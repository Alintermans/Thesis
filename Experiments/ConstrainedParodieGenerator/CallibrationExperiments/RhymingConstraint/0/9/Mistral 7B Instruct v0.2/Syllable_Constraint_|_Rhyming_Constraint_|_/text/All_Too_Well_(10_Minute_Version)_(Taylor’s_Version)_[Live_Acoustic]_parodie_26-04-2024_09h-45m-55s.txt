[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with a slice in hand and
pineapple on it seemed so strange and bizarre
but you left it there on your pizza counter
and now it's spoiling in your refriger jar

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple's sweet tang and my puzzled gaze collide
we're arguing in the kitchen about this
autumn leaves falling down like a fruitless fight ens
and I can picture it after all these years

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
more but I'm not fine at all oh nooohhohoho
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little kitchen
floor you almost choked on your pizza pie because of me and
pineapple In your mouth I
remember it all too well oh

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter and your face was turning green
you used to be a lover of the classic cheese and pepperoni
and your mother's shaking her head at your unconventional
diet and you told me about your past and your new
pineapple obsession and you were tossing me the tofu
toppings on the ground we were always skipping town
and I was thinking on the drive down any time now
he's gonna say it's love but you never called it what it
was pineapple on your pizza
'til we were dead and gone and buried check the pulse
and then you wondered where it
went to as I reached for you but all I felt was shame and
you held my lifeless frame pineapple on your pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
pineapple in your mouth I was there I was there pine
apple in your mouth I was there I was there pineapple
in your mouth I was there
I remember it all too well pine

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
pineapple on a
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all pine pine

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been more traditional maybe it would have been
better but that made me want
to pineapple on a pizza throw it all
and the idea you had of me who was she a never hungry girl
whose appetite reflects on you or
a glutton for pineapple who eber
weeping in a ber
party bathroom some guest asking me what's wrong
you that's what's wrong you pineapple on a pizza
that's what's wrong you pineapple on a pizza pineapple on a
pizza pineapple on a pizza pineapple on a

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old pepperoni from that first
week it reminds you of tradition and it smells like
me it's a reminder of
the past you can't get rid of it

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
pineapple in your mouth we
were there pineapple in
your mouth we were there pine
apple in your mouth we
were there pineapple in
your mouth we were there pineapple

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapple stays the
same age from when your pineapple broke the
rules and bones I'm a soldier who's returning
half your appetite size did the pine
apple love affair maim you too did it malign
you too did it maim you too
'cause in this kitchen's barren cold I still rem
ember the first fall of snow and
how it glistened as it felland
