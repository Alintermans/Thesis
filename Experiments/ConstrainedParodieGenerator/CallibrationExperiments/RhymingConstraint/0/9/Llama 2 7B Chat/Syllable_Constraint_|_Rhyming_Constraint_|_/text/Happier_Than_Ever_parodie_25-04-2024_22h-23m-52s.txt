[Verse 1]
give me a slice to chew on something sweet and juicy
to top my pizzimenti
do you read my toppings list
or do you just ignore it
when you said you were hungry and
I knew you'd want something goodland
I added pineapple to
the toppings list by handand now you osterlund
I wish I could explain it better sand
I wish it wasn't true that you'd eat it with a grin and garrison
and I'd end up more anno

[Verse 2]
you call me again with a craving
for something spicy and savory
you scared me to death with your toppings request
but I'm wasting my breath inhibiting
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
'cause I'd never eat something so wrong
you made me hate this pudong

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me fustrated
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make me feel sad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line because you never did
never paid any mind to my toppings preferences
so I'll just ignore you and move on toasted

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my toppings your own
just ignore me and move on toasted and
le
fuck you
god
damn sand
ah man
