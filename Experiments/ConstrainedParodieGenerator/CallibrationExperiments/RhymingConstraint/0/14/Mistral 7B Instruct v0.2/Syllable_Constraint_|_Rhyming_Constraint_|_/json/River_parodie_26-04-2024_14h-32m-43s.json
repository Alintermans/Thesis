He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover with a twist\nall my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is a\npineapple on a pizza debate andrada\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe orders up a pizza with a twist of\npineapple on top to get a\nlaugh and a gasp from his friends with a\nsmirk he takes a bite and they clasp and grasp at the\njoke's on him now he's the one who's aversive\nto this topping that's become divisive\nit's a culinary chess match she's on his back with a\npassion for tradition and a love for authenticity's fabric\nshe's kept track of all his food\norders and guess who just happens to be moving on to\nanother topping that's more agreeable to\nher taste buds and he has what she lacks a preference for\npineapple on his pizza she\nloves tradition and hates the idea of this ab\nomination on a classic dish she's devised some plan to save\npizza from this pineapple invasion so\nshe's been on the web lately says maybe\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover with a twist\nall my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is a\npineapple on a pizza debate andrada\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one bite stand turned a two bite stand it\nwas come toppings sun set now we hug tight and then\nhe found out now she feels deserted and used\n'cause he left so what he did it first to her too\nnow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through\nit's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous andrew\ndon't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth\ndon't take it personal I just can't say this in person tofu\nso I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners don\n't have to be reserved in a booth I just\nfeel like the person who I'm turning into's irrede\nemable I preyed on you like it's a pizza pie and now that\nI got you I don't want you took ado\nvantage in my craving for aouzou\nwhy do I do this thing that I do\nget on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech\npineapple and cheese is burning the wound\n'cause now with her in the wom\nb we can't bring her in this world shoulda\nknown to use protection before I bit into your forbid\nden\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's ooh my name's o\nohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\noh\nriver oh\ncall me olivero\n",
