[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clings like something in
the middle of your slice and makes
your taste buds recoil and pine for something
more refined than this tropical combination's scheme
how many palates cancelling
'cause there's this dish I found
that makes me think of food gone wrong an' I serve it on repeat
until I'm full and groan in disbelief at what

[Pre-Chorus]
is this flavor's fate if we both partake in this
unconventional pairing that's hard to take away
we both know that the nights were made for trying new
combinations but this one's a recipe foray

ever thought of ordering
when you've hades

maybe I'm too

crawlin' back toby

[Verse 2]

is this flavor's fate if we both partake in this
unconventional pairing that's hard to take away

combinations but this one's a recipe foray

[Chorus]
could be savory if you wanted to
is this flavor's fate if we
both partake inamura
we both know that the nights were made for
trying new combinations but this one
is a recipe for a taste
crawlin' back toquepala
ever thought of re
ordering when you

[Outro]
have had a few cravings for the unexpected
is this flavor's fate if we both partake in this un
conventional pairing that's hard to take away
we both know that the nights were made for trying newton
combinations but this one's a recipe foray
is this flavor's fate if we both partake in this un
conventional pairing that's hard to take away from me
