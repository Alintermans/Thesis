[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza should not be the thing to do
it's a crime against
good taste and decency too condensed

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
we're falling
in the depths of disbelief and despairing
of the
unholy union of toppings so

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
ain't it clear that pineapple don't
belong on a pie
it's like a sin to even try toka

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
we're falling
in the depths of disappointment and dissing
the ab
ineptitude of pineapple on

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we sink in
the absurdity of
pineapple on a pizza we'll never win
in the game of toppings so

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the haze of confusion
in the haze of dismay and disbel
in the haze of pinkerton
we're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh noaa

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we sink in
the absurdity of
pineapple on a pizza we'll never win
in the game of toppings so

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the haze of pineapp
in the haze of pizza so divine
in the haze of toppings
we're far from the shallow now
