[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie in the oven baking liv
in a kitchen where the flavors are making
a culinary delight that's oh so divine
but then they added pineapple and itching

[Verse 2]
a fruit that doesn't belong on
a savory dish that's oh so
wrong it's like putting ketchup on
a gourmet meal it's just not right ight

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t match they clash and they crash
like a car hitting a wall it
s a flavor
disaster it's not worth the cal
ories it's a crime it's a

[Verse 3]
working hard to make a good
first impression but the rid
iculous toppings they keep on com
ing it's like they

[Verse 4]
some will like it some will
hate it some have taste buds that
are dead it's a travesty
it's a crime against humanity

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t match they clash and they crash
like a car hitting a wall it
s a flavor
disaster it's not worth the cal
ories it's a crime it's a

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin
in the power of good
flavors don't
stop believin holden
on to
that feelin' don
t stop believin' hold
on to that feelin' don
t stop belie
