[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with pineapple on his plate
to catch flack sweat jackets and dress
slacks on his breath he's a mistake he
doesn't know that pineapple on pizza is a
mess it's a chess match he's on his way to digate
she's kept track of all his bad food takes and
guess who just happens to be moving on to the next dish
actually just shit on that pizza and order fish instead of
that abomination on
his plate she has what his taste buds lacks but still he insists
on putting pineapple on his pizza and he
just doesn't get it it's a disgrace so let the river
run and wash away that disgust
from your plate and start anew without that pineapple
abuse so bye bye to that pizza excuse me while I order
something else instead of that disrespectful
food on my plate so let the river run

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a one bite stand it
was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and say good
bye to that pizza she just wants to exact
revenge and get back at that pizza she can
keep the crust I don't want it I don't wanton
that pizza I'm aloof nervous and done withington
that pizza I just can't take it anymore it's time
to move on from that pizza I revert to the studio like holeman
in the wall diners don't have to be reserved in a booth I just
feel like the person who I'm turning I
nto is irreversible I preyed on that pizza
like it's church at the pew and now that I got it I donnan
t want it took advantage inquisition
in my thirst to consume that pizza now

pizza so I revert to the social
media like holeman
