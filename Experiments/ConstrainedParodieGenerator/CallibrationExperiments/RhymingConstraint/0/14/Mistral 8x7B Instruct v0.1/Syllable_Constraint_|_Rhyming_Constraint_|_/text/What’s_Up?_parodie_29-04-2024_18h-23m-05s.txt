[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I tried pineapple once and knew right then
it was a culinary mistake I couldn't ab
sorb or tolerate well

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I'm at the table
just to get it off my plate witherell
and I feel a little repulsive now and then
and so I rise in the morning and I step away
from the fridge with caution and I take a deep
breathe and I say with disdain clear and
loudly to the

[Chorus]
audience around me
I say hey
hey hey hey I say hey hey hey
I said hey what's going
on with this
pizza topping choice anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I'm at the table
just to get it off my plate witherell
and I feel a little repulsive now and then
and so I rise in the morning and I step away
from the fridge with caution and I take a deep
