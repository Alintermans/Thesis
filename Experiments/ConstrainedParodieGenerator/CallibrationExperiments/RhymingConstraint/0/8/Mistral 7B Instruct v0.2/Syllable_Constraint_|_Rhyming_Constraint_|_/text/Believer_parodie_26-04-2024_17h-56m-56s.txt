[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
a taste that just won't pers worse

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you judge me for my culinary cre
I'm the one who orders
pineapple on my pizza's the key

[Pre-Chorus]
I was served a slice once in a
kitchen filled with laughter and dismay
topped with ham and pineapple and
pepperoni and onions galore and still I stand
believing in the power of
pineapple's unique savory
savoring every bite of
pineapple's surprising flavor

[Chorus]
pain apple made me a believer
pain apple made me a
believer in the taste so unclear
pain apple madeira
pain apple breaks me down and builds me up high
my palate's love came from this fruit
pain apple made me alexander
pain apple made meara

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the food gods above
all the hate that you've heard
about pineapple on pizza's a love
pineapple's love up above now

[Pre-Chorus]
I was skeptical at first
but then I tried it in ayer
topped with bacon and ham and cur
pineapple's combination was
a burst of flavors in my ear and still I stand here
believing in the power of pineapple's harmony and
symphony in

pineapple's power to ignite my taste buds with delight and
