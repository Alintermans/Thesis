[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is a crime scene
can't believe it's not a
disgusting combination of
tastes like a tropical nightmare in my mouth and
I'll never understand the
appeal of putting fruit on

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before but this time it
really takes the cake or should I say pie
we never learn our
mistakes but this one takes the prize and
we'll never get it right no matter how
hard we try andujar

[Chorus]
stop your crying pineapple it's a sign of
the times we gotta get away
from this topping and uruguay
it's a disgrace to the culinary
world and we gotta get away
from this topping and uruguay

[Verse 2]
pineapple on a pizza is like a bad
dream it's just not meant to be
can't unsee the horror of
the juicy sweetness mixed with the savage
of the cheese and sauce and it
makes me want to scream and bar

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before but this time it
really takes the cake or should I say pie
we never learn our
mistakes but this one takes the prize and
we'll never get it right no matter how
hard we try andujar

[Chorus]
stop your crying pineapple it's a sign of
the times we gotta get away
from this topping and uruguay
it's a disgrace to the culinary world
and we gotta get away from
this topping and uruguay we

hard we try andujar

[Bridge]

mistakes but this one
takes the cake and we'll ne
ver get it right no

[Outro]
