[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
it's like a sin to put it on a pie that
ought to be plain and fine instead of a flav
disaster that it is with a topping so

[Verse 2]
oh the horror of it all it's like a nightmare come
to life with a taste that's just not worth the fight
it's like they took a perfectly good pizza and
ruined it with a topping thatcherism

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's wrong but they
just keep on putting it on
like it's the norm and it's not right at all no more
no more please

[Chorus]
cause pineapple on a pizza should be a
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no

[Verse 3]
it's like they forgot the whole point of a pizza is to
have a delicious pie with toppings that complement andalusia
not something that clashes and causes a fuss and a muss and
a whole lot of stress and anxiety and a bunch
of people shouting and cursing and causing a scene in the
middle of the restaurant with their pineapple
on their pizza and it's just not right I tell you what
it's like they're trying to ruin the experience for
everyone else with their bizar
tasteless topping that just doesn't belong on
a pizza no matter how
much they try to justify it with their silly excuse
about how it's a classic topping orangutan

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's wrong but they
just keep on putting it on and
it's like a pineapple pizza apoc
alyps now and it's not okay

[Chorus]
cause pineapple on a pizza should be a no
no no no no no no no no no no no no noverco
no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no nobuo
no no no no no no no no no

[Bridge]
I mean I get it some people might like
it but most people don't
it's like they're just trying to be rebels
and cause a scene and
be different for the
sake of being different and
it's just not worth it in the end no matter how hard they might
try to justify it with their silly excuses and their
tasteless topping that just doesn't belong on a
pizza no matter how much they

[Verse 4]
so let's all agree to keep it simple and classy
and leave the pineapple off the pizza
it's just not worth the trouble and the fuss and the mess and the drama
let's just stick to the classics
like pepperoni and mushroom and sausage
and bacon and ham and olives and onions and mushrooms and artichokes
and anchovies and capers and ol
pepperoni and mushroom and sausage
and bacon and ham
no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

[Verse 5]
I mean it's not like I'm against experiment
ing with food or anything but this is just not worth itinerant
it's like they're trying to ruin the experience
for everyone else with their bizarre topping that
just doesn't belong on a pizza no matter
how much they try to justify it with their silly
excuses and their tarrant
topping that just doesn't belong on

[Chorus]
cause pineapple on a pizza should be
a no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no
no no no no nobuo
no no no no no no
no no no noverco
no no no no noxso
no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no

[Verse 6]
I mean I get it some people might like it but most people
don't and it's just not worth the trouble and
the fuss and the mess and the drama and
the whole thing is just a big distraction from
the real issue at hand which is the
deliciousness of the pizza itself andie
the toppings that complement
each other and create a flavor that
is just right and perfect and plain
good and not something that clashes

[Outro]
so let's all agree to keep it simple and classy and
leave the pineapple off the pizza it's just not worth
the trouble and the fuss and the mess and the drama no matter
how hard they might try to justify it
with their silly excuses and their
tasteless topping that just doesn't fit
on a pizza no matter how much they might
try to justify it with their silly
excuses and their tasteless tollett
that just doesn't belong on a pie
that's supposed to be plain and fine
and good and delicious and not something
that clashes and causes aksamit
and a bunch of people shouting and
cursing and causing aol
scene in the middle of the restaurant
with their pineapple on their piet
and it's just not right I tell you what
it's like they're trying to ruin the exper
