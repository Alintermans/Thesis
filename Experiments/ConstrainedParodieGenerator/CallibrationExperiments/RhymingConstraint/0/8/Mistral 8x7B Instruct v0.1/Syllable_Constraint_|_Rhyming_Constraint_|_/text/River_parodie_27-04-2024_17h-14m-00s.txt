[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with pineapple on his plate
to catch flack sweat jackets and dress
slacks on his breath he's a mistake he
doesn't know that pineapple on pizza is a
mess it's a chess match he's on his way to digate
she's kept track of all his bad food takes and
guess who just happens to be moving on to the next dish
actually just shit on that pizza and order fish instead of
that abomination on
his plate she has what his taste buds lacks but still he insists
on putting pineapple on his pizza and he
just doesn't get it it's a disgrace so let the river
run and wash away that disgust
from your plate and start anew without that pineapple
abuse so bye bye to that pizza excuse me while I order
something else instead of that disrespectful
food on my plate so let the river run

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a one bite stand it
was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and say good
bye to that pizza she just wants to exact
revenge and get back at that pizza she can
keep the crust I don't want it I don't need it

run and wash away that bad taste from my mouth so I can enjoy myhren

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if life was aaa
highway and pineapple was a sin I'd be swerving in
five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin on ice
maybe that's why I may have came at you
sideways I can't keep it
straight but I made you terminate my slice
this love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
but I really woulda loved your style
didn't really wanna eat that slice but fuck
it what's one more lie to tell our unborn

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
s gonna do is off the truth
and my jokes now are falling like the rain so let
the river run and wash
