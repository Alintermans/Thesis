[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is
a topping that's just not right in my eyesaid it's a crime
do you ever get that feeling that you
can't shift the tide of disgust
are there some toppings up your sleeve that you
haven't tried to make it more bearable to chewsa
I've dreamt about pineapple on
a pizza being
a nightmare that I can't escape from my dreams to realit
how many secrets can you keep before you give

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from my plate
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for toppings that are great to

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
supermarket to get rid
of that pizza
ever thought of
callin' when you
haven't had a few
'cause I always doxology
busy beata
to fall forcibly

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been wonderin' if your palate's still
open to something that's not a crime toothpaste
and if so I wanna know what time it shutscausing a
simmer down and pucker up I'm sorry to interruptyou
it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to
kiss the topping that's not pineapple away from

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from my plate
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for toppings that are great to

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the supermarket to
get rid of that pizza that
ever thought ofelia
callin' when you've had ariella
'cause I always doxologybusy be
to fall forcibly to fall for
someone who doesn't put a
pineapple on a
pizza that's justa

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
sad to see you go was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for toppings that are great to
do I wanna know if you want me crawlin' back to
you to get rid of that pineapple that's just a crime
to fall forcibly to fall for someone who doesn't put
