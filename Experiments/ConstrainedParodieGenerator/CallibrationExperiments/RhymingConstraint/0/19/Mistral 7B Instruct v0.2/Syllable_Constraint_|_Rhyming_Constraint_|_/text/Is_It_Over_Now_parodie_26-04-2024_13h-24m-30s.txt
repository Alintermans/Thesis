[Intro]
is it right to dine with pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once the pie had baked and cool
pineapple on the pizza rule
I savored every fool
your taste buds refused

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later I see
your toppings and your cheese on unsuspecting eaters' plates they
dream of my pepperoni before it called you achebe
you search in every chef's kitchen for something greater baby

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they added pineapple on
was it wrong when they sliced it thin and long oh
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now oh oh

[Post-Chorus]
is it wrong is it wrong

[Verse 2]
when you lost your taste control
tomato sauce and pine
red sauce and green pineapple
your new dish is a sign

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
there were flashin' lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizzas out of
sight only rumors about my me
ats andrzejewski
oh lord I think about throwing
a tomato at very
tall pizzerias just to
see you come runnin' and say the one thing I

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred arguments later oh no
if it's got pineapple on it I will surmise that you'll probably hate
it oh no you dream of my pepperoni before it called you
a pineapple traitor oh no you search in every chef's stove

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they added pineapple on
was it wrong when they sliced it thin and long oh
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now oh oh

[Post-Chorus]
is it
wrong is it wrong is it
wrong is
it wrong islet

[Bridge]
think I didn't notice
there were flashin' lights
at least I had the decency
to keep my pizzas out of
sight only rumors about my me
ats andrzejewski
oh lord I think about throwing
a tomato at very
tall pizzerias just to see you
come runnin' and say the one thing I've been long

[Outro]
flashin' lights oh lord let
us fast forward to three hundred takeout orders later oh
flashin' lights I was hoping you'd be there
and say the one thing oh lord
I've been wanting but no
was it
wrong was it wrong was it wrong was it wrong was it
