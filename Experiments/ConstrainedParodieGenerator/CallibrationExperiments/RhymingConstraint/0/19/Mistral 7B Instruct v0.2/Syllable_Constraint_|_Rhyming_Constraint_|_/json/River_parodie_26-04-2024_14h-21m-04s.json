He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover with a twist\nall my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is a\npineapple on a pizza debate andrada\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe orders up a pizza with a twist of\npineapple on top to get a\nlaugh and a gasp from his friends with a\nsmirk he takes a bite and they clasp and grasp at the\njoke's on him now he's the one to fast forward\nthrough the night with a frown on his face and\nshe just wants to assert her culinary taste and save\nthe day by removing the pineapple from his plate and rave about\nhow it clashes with the sauce\nit's a debate we're in the midst of a culinary\nchess match she's on his case and he's on the defense\nbut she's got the facts and he's on the fence about it's den\nence and he's trying to pretend\nbut she's got a plan to change his mind and defend her\ntaste buds and he's got to admit it's a pineapple crime scene and\nshe's got the solution to end this debate\nknife in hand she's determined to save the\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover with a twist\nall my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is a\npineapple on a pizza debate andrada\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\none night he ordered a pizza with a\npineapple on top it was a one way ticket\nto a two way argument it was come sun\nlight scram and now they hug tight and talk about\nhow they used to love it but now they've grown apart and\nhe found out she's got a new favorite topping and\nnow how am I supposed to tell this guy that we're through and\nit's hard to find the words I'm aloof and nervous and blue but I know he\ndeserves the truth so I revert to the studio like a hole in\nthe wall diner I don't have toland\nbe reserved in a booth I just feel like the person\nI'm turning into's irreversible I preached about the\npineapple on a pizza debate but now\nI'm the one who's been deceived and now with\nher in the lead I can't bring her\nin this world shoulda known to use protection fore\nI bit into your forbidden fruit and\nfuck this pineapple on\na pizza debate andrada I'm sorry\nI don't want to admit to something if all it's gonna\ncost\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's ooh my name's o\nh pine\nap\nple on a\npizza debate runco\nll me ooh call me olivera\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the jester never the hero\npineapple on a pizza debate and\nfuck can I say if life was a highway and deceit was\nan enclave I'd be swerving in five lanes and I may\nhave came at you sideways I can't keep\nmy lies straight but I made you\nterminate our baby this love tri\nangle left us in a wreck tangled what else can\nI say it was fun for a while but I'd have\nloved your smile did I really wanna\nabort but what's one more lie to tell our\nunborn child pineapple on a pizza deb\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker with a pine\nbeen a lover with a twist\nall my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align\nwell little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\ngonna cause is a pineapple\non a pizza debate andrada tracheal\n",
