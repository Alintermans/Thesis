[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we
must face this culinary war
you might think it's tasty but it's a flawed notion
it looks absurd on a pie
it's just not right my friend oh

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but still weirton
tempted by the sweetness of pineapple
slices oh ohara

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
face this culinary war and
put an end to this debate once and for
all we must move on from this trend
it's time to put pineapple to

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice with a grin on
it's a sign of the times we
must face this culinary
war and embrace the classics instead of
trends that don't belong on
a pizza ohbayashi

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but still weirton
tempted by the sweetness of pineapple
slices oh ohara

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a smile on
it's a sign of the times we must
face this culinary war and
put an end to this debate once and for all
we must move on from this trend and
embrace the classics instead oh

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but still weirton
tempted by the sweetness of pineapple
slices oh ohara

[Bridge]
we don't taste enough
we should explore and
try new things but not this
will we ever learn
we've tasted before
it's just not meant to

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on we
must move on from this trend
we got to get away from this debate and find
a new topping to enjoy instead oh oh oh
we got to get away from this
we got to get away from this
we got to get away from this
