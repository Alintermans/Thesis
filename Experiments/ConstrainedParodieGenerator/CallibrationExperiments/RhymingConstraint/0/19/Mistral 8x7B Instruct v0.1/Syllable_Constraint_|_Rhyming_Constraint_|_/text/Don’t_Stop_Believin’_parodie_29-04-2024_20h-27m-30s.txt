[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and tom
just a foodie born and raised in new york city
pizza lover on a quest to find the bomb

[Verse 2]
a slice in a crowded pizzer
topped with pineapple and ham from
for a taste they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
critics waiting
up and down the streetlights glow
their reviews searching in the night
pizza lovers
eating just to find delight hid
somewhere in the nighttime show

[Verse 3]
working hard to find the best
everyone wants a slice that
tops all others and will pass the test
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
hate the taste andersonville
oh the debate will never
end it goes on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
critics waiting
up and down the streetlights glow
their reviews searching in the night
pizza lovers
eating just to find delight hid
somewhere in the nighttime show

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating don
t stop hating on that
pizza lovers
don't stop hollomon
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop hambleton
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
