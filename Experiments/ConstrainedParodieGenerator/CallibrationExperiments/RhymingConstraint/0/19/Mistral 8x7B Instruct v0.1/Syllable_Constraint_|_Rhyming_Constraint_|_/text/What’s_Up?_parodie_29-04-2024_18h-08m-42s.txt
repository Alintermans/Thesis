[Verse 1]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate
I tried pineapple once and knew right then
it was a culinary mistake I couldn't ab
sorb or tolerate well

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I'm at the table
just to get it off my plate and into
the trash can's fable and I feel a little rep
ulsed and so I wake in the morning and avoid
the pizza place and I take a deep breath and
avoid the smell and I quietly
say to myself

[Chorus]
what's going on with this
pizza trend
and I say hey hey hey hey hey
what's going onassis
and I say
hey hey hey hey hey what's going

[Bridge]
oh no
oh
oh no no
oh no
oh
oh noxso

[Verse 2]
and I tried
my best to enjoy it
but I failed and now
I'm a pizza purist
and I pray
for the day we allay
this notion of pineapple on
a pizza pie oh

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I'm at the table
just to get it off my plate and into
the trash can's fable and I feel a little rep
ulsed and so I wake in the morning and avoid
the pizza place and I take a deep breath and
avoid the smell and I quietly
say to myself

[Chorus]
what's going on with this
pizza trend
and I say hey hey hey hey
hey what's going onass
and I say
hey hey hey hey hey what's going
on with this pineapple
on pizza thing and I say hey hey
hey hey hey
what's going onassis and I say
hey hey hey
hey hey hey hey hey what's going
on with this pineapple
on pizza thing and I say heyday
hey hey hey hey hey
what's going onassis andante
and I say
hey hey hey hey hey what's going

[Bridge]
oh no

oh no no

[Outro]
a quarter century and
I'm still fighting this fungus invasion plan
on my pizza slice fate and
