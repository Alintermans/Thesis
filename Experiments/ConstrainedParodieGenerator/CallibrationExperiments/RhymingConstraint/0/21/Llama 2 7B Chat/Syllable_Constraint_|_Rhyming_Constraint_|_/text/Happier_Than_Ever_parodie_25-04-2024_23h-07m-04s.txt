give me a slice to chew on something sweet and juicy
to top my pizzimenti
do you read my toppings list
or do you just ignore it
when you said you were hungry and
I knew you'd want something more than
just a pineapple core in
I wish it wasn't true that you'd want something so

please don't drive me insane with your
fruity topping demands again and again
I don't relate to you and your to

toppings and preferences and didier

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my pizzas your own
just fuckin' leave me alone with your to

ah god
ah
