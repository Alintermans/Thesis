[Verse 1]
just a pineapple on a pizza town girl liv
livin' in a lonely world of cheese and sau
she took the midnight train goin' anywhere but
not to pineapple on a pizza inlaw

[Verse 2]
a pineapple on a pizza
singer in a smoky room of
their shadows searchin' in the night
for a taste that's just not right oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the boulevard
their tastebuds searchin' in the
night for something
just not pineapple on a pie
oh no no nobuyuki

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get my fill
everybody wants a slice
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more to

[Verse 4]
some will win some will lose
some are born to disabuse
oh the pineapple never
ends it goes on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waitin
up and down the boulevard
their tastebuds searchin' in the
night for something
just not pineapple on a pie
oh no no nobuyuki

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop pineapple
hold on to that feelin
streetlights people
don't stop pineal
hold on
streetlights people
don't stop pinnacle
hold on to that feelin
streetlights people
