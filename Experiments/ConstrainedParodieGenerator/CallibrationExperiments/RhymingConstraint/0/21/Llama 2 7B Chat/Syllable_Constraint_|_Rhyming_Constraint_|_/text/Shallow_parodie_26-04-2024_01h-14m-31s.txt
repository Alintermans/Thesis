[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza should not be the thing to do
it's a crime against
good taste and decency too condensed

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
we're falling
in the depths of disbelief at the topping
choice we
can't believe it's not just a phase

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
isn't it obvious why pineapple
doesn't belong on
a pizza should be a crime oregon

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
we're falling
in the depths of disappointment at the to
topping
can't believe it's not just a phase

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the che
crash through the surface where the toppings can't
hurt us we're far from the shall

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the ha ha shallow in
the ha ha shallow low in the ha
ha ha shallow we're far from
the shallow now heparin

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the che
crash through the surface where the toppings can't
hurt us we're far from the shall

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
we're off the deep end watch
as we dive in we'll never meet the
crash through the surface where
the toppings can't hurt us
