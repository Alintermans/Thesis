[Intro]
come on pineapple lovers we wanna say good

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pineapple's on pantheon
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
why don't we leave it on the
cutting board at
home and not in the pussycat
seems you cannot be replaced
and I'm the one who will stay mad oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world it's just che
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just che
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the phone
pineapple you're no good on
why are you sitting at home on the floor
what kind of toppings are you
ringin' the bell
and nobody's coming to help
your taste buds live by themselves
they just want to know that you're well oh oh chor

[Chorus]
in this world it's just che
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world it's just che
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home get ahead five stars internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave pizza alone two slices follow
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
