[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up and declare

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple on pizza is a crime against taste
a culinary abomination that
can't be defended with reason or grace aut
umn leaves falling down like flavors out of place

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that pizza's not the same no
more and I might be okay but my taste buds are
not fine at

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that menu list you
almost ordered it cause you were looking at me wishing it
was something more than just a
topping on a pie but I stopped

[Verse 3]
photo of a hawaiian pizza on the counter your
stomach was turning green you used to be a little kid ecuador
and your mother's telling stories bout you on the soccer team
you told me bout your cravings thinking your future was
meat eating pineapple on pizza was always skipping town
and I was thinking on the drive down any to
ppings now he's gonna say it's love you never called it
what it was til we were dead and gone and buried check the
pulse and come back swearing it's the
same after three months in the grave and then you
wondered where it went to as
I reached for you but all I felt was shame and you held I
lifeless frame I was there I remember itochu

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing bout the toppings in the refrigerator
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
well and there we are again when nobody had to
know you kept your pineapple pizza a secret but I
kept your taste buds like an
oath sacred prayer and we'd swear to re

[Bridge]
member it all too well yeah maybe we
got lost in translation or
maybe pineapple doesn't belong on
pizza maybe this
thing was a masterpiece
'til you tore it all up running scra
ed I was there I remember it all too well and you call
me up again just to break me like a promise so casu
ally cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of san

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but pineapple on pi
zza's in a new hell every time you
double cross my taste buds mind you said if we had been closer in age
maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die the idea
you had of me who was she a never needy ever lovely jewel
whose shine reflects on you not weeping
in a party bathroom some haeberle
asking me what'll
happen you that's what happened you you who char
med my taste buds with self effacing jokes sipping
coffee like you're on a late night show but then he watched me watch the
front door all night willing you to come and he said it's supp

[Verse 5]
posed to be fun turning twenty one time won't
fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to be my old self don
e again but I'm still trying to find it after
plaid shirt days and nights when you made meisenheimer
now you mail back my toppings and I walk home a
lone but you keep my old slice from that very first week
cause it reminds you of flav
or and it smells like me you can't

[Chorus]
get rid of it cause you remember it
all too well yeah you remember it all too well wind
in my hair you were there
you remember it all too well
down the stairs you were there you
remember it all too
well it was rare I was
there I remember it

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapples staymy
age from when your hawaiian broke my taste
and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half
my weight and did the twin flame bruise paint
you blue just between us did the love affair ma

barren cold I still remember the first
fall of snow and how it glistened
