[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni andries
and bbq with a
cheese that's all aflow
but pineapple just won
through to me it doesn't belong on a pizza gone

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said where d'you wanna go
how far will you pursue
I'm not looking for a slice that
is too exotic and new
just something savo
ry and tasty too
something I can share with you
something I can chew through
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
ham and pineapple please
but that's a combo that
I won't ever choose
I'm not the kind of guy
that would put pineapple on my pizza pie

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much will you pursue I
'm not looking for a slice that's got
pineapple to chew I'm just
looking for ara
ndom slice to savor
something I can share with you
something I cannister

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
where d'you wanna go how

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
much will you pursue
I'm not looking for a
slice that's too exotic and new
just something savory and
tasty too something
I can share with you
something I can chew through oh
I want something just like
this I want something just like

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
this oh I want something just like
this oh I want something just like
this oh I want something just like
