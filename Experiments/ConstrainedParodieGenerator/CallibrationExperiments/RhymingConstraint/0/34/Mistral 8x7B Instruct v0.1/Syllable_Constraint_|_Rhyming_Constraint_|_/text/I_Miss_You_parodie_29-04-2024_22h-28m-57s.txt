[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
please forego
the pineapple tostado
on pizza's sacred doughy bedding place
the sweetness clashes with the
savory sauce and spices
it's a monstrosity that should not exist
we can savor marinas
or alfredo if we wish instead
and in the night we'll wish this never spread
we'll wish this never spread

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp
please forego tavares

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where's the ham that once resided
on this cheesy bread creation nightly
a sweet and savory marriage
now destroyed by fruit
that's just not right or tight at all tonightly
and as I stare at this con
coction that's been foisted on
my taste buds and my sanity er
osion sets in as I question
this culinary treason
will I ever eat pizza peacefully
peacefully again

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add this mess to me you're already
the taste inside my mouth
I despise it I desp
please forego this sinful fruit dishonesty
I despise it I desp
please forego tavares

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add this mess to me you're already
the taste inside my mouth
I despise it I desp
please forego this sinful fruit dishonesty
I despise it I desp
please forego tavares
I despise it I despise itty
I despise it I desp
please forego tavares
outro mark hoppus I despise it, I desp
please forego tavares
I despise it I desp

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
please forego tavares
I despise it I desp
please forego tavares
