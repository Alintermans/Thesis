[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something true
do you find pineapple on pizza
to be right or wrong
do you think it belongs hopalong

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm falling
in all the good times I'm appalled bypassing
on the
pineapple hype train I won't be

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
do you think it's just a ploy to annoy
or do you see the
fun in the absurdity ofc

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in all the good times I'm appalled bypassing
on the
pineapple hype train I won't be

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching you defend
that fruit on pizza it
crashes the harmony where it can't blend
we're far from the savory

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha shallows of bad
taste we won't be had by pineap
pizza gone mad nov
elty we're far from the sav

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching you defend
that fruit on pizza it
crashes the harmony where it can't blend
we're far from the savory

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha shallows of
bad taste we won't be had by pine
apple hype aversive
we're far from the savory
