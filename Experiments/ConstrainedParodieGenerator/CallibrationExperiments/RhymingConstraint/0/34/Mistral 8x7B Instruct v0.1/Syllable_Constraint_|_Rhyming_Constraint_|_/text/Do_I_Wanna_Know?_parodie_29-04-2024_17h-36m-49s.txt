[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple quite que
on your pizza pie distasteful find it hard to swallow
do you ever get that feeling of dece
it's not a treat to bite and che
do you ever get that pineapple creep
slipping on your pizza like a grease slick sheet oh no
how many slices have you we
ped before you say
this topping's just not meant to stay on my pizza tray today
an' I just can't take it any way but pine

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this belief is shared with
do I wanna know if you've had enough of pineap
please say it's true that you've had pineapple too and
do I wanna know if you've had enough of pineap

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to you
ever thought of orderin
without pine due
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
tired of pineap
to fall for another to
now I've thought it through
crawlin' back tofu

[Verse 2]
so do you got the nerve
to tell the waiter to hold the pineap
will you stand up for what you deserve deserve
simmer down and taste the dough without the pineap messin
up your crust it's just not worth the fuss oh no no no no no
but we could have a slice if you wanted tokyo
style or margherita without the pineo

[Pre-Chorus]

truth about pineapplin' on
my pizza pie noisily

[Outro]
