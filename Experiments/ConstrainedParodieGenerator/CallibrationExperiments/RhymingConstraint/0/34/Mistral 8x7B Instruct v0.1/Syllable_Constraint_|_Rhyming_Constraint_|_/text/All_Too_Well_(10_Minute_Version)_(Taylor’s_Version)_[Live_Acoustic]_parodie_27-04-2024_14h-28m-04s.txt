[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow
the slimy fruit mixed with cheese and tomato
I spit it out and now I'm telling you how

[Verse 2]
oh that sweet and savory combination fell flat
like a bad joke at a party you can't
take back the taste still lingers in my mouth like a
bad dream that I can't seem to forget at

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's not meant to
be on a pizza slice at
all but I'm still craving something edible and
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it is again on that triangle
slice of pizza with pineapple chunks so vile and wrong somehow
grease and juice mixing in a
disgusting mess I regret it

[Verse 3]
toppings scattered on the counter like a messy after
math problem I'm trying to solve but I can't seem to makeover
come out on top I'm left with a bad taste and a memory
that I can't seem to shake off I'm left wondering
why anyone would put pineapple on a pizza inning
all reason and logic it's a culinary
crime that I can't seem to forgive or forget it
all too well I remember it all too well I regret
it all too well I remember
it all too well I regret it all too well
I regret it all too well
I regret it all too well I regret it all too well
I regret it all too well I regret italtel

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's not meant to
be on a pizza slice at all
but I'm still craving something edible
and oh oh oh I regret it

[Chorus]
cause there it is again on that triangle slice
of pizza with pineapple chunks so vile and wrong somehow the
grease and juice mixing in
a disgusting mess I regret
it all too well I remember It all too well I
regret It all too well I regret It all too well I
regret it all too well
I regret it all too well I reg

[Bridge]
well maybe I'm just a traditional
pizza lover but I can
t seem to understand why anyone
would ruin a good
pie with pineapple chunks
I just can't get over it
I regret it all too well I remember it all too well
I regret it all too well I regret it all too well and
I can't seem to get over it I regret
it all too well I remember

[Verse 4]
the first time I tried pineapple pizza I was young
and naive I didn't know any bet
ter I thought it was just another topping but now I know the truth
and I can't seem to un
see the horror of pineapple on pizza
I'm haunted by the memory of it all too well I regret it all
too well I regret it all too well
I regret it all too well I regret
it all too well a
nd I can't seem to get over it a
nd I can't seem to forget it all too well
I regret it all too well I regret it all too well I reg
ret it all too well I regret it all too well I reg

[Verse 5]
time won't heal the wound of pineapple pizza
it's a trauma that I'll carry with me forever I cannata
get the taste out of my mouth or the memory out
of my head I'm stuck with this regret for all time
I'll always remember the taste of pineapple
on pizza and I'll always regret it all too well
I regret it all too well
I regret it all too well I'll al

[Chorus]
ways remember it all too well I'll al
ways regret it all too well I regret it all too

[Verse 6]
and I was never a fan of pineapple pizza but now
I'm even more convinced that it's a culin
ary crime that should be banned I'll never
forgive or forget the taste of pineapple
on pizza it's a horror that will
haunt me for all time I'll always remember it
