[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie in the oven baking liv
in a kitchen where the flavors are making
a culinary delight that's oh so divine
but then they added pineapple aven

[Verse 2]
a fruit that's sweet and juicy too
but it don't belong on a
pizza that's just not what to do
it's a sin it's a crime it's a trav

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t belong together they
just don't mix they're like oil and
water they'll just
separate forever and e
ver and e ver egeland

[Verse 3]
pepperoni and sausage
yes they're a great combina
tion mushrooms onions and bell peppers
oh what a del

[Verse 4]
but pineapple on a
pizza it's just aweida
it's a crime against human
ity it's a pizza tragedy

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t belong together they
just don't mix they're like oil and
water they'll just
separate forever and e
ver and e ver egeland

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]

that feelin' street
lights people donaldson
stop believin inwood
