[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is
a topping that's just not right in my eyesaid it's a crime
do you ever get that feeling that you
can't shift the tide of disgust
are there some toppings up your sleeve that you
haven't tried to make it more bearable to chewsa
I've dreamt about pineapple on
a pizza being
a nightmare that I can't escape from my dreams to realit
how many secrets can you keep before you give

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from my plate
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for toppings that arrogate

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
supermarket to get rid
of theora
ever thought of
callin' pizza
to tell them to stop
bein' yours topsy-turvy
now I've thoughtfully
crawlin' back toya

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been wonderin' if your toppings are still
on the level or just a waste aftertaste
simmer down and pucker up I'm sorry to interrupt
it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to avoid
but I don't know if you feel the same as I do
about pineapple on a pizza alkaloid

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from my plate
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for toppings that arrogate

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the supermarket to
get rid of theora off
ever thought ofelia
callin' pizza to tell them toa
stop bein' yours topsy turvy now I
thoughtfully crawlin' back to ya
do I wanna know if you
want mezzaluna
to bevalaqu

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from my plate
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for toppings that arrogate
to be mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine
to be mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine
to be mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine
