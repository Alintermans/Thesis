[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings need holy water to wash away the
well little pineapple on a
I don't want to admit to something soza
if all it's gonna cause

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his neck scratched to catch some
sweat and spice and everything nice
on his breath is pineapple he's a
sex addict and he just wants to exact reven
it's a chess match he's on his back like a jetpack
she's kept track of all his pizza toppings
and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually just shredded mozzarella and pepperoni and
she's devised some plan to top
him in the back with a cherry pepperoni and she
has what my ex lacks and I know she's using me
to try to play him but I don't care hi pineapple
but I shoulda said bye pineapp
after the first slice but tonight I am pineapple
pizza should not be on a pizza should not be on a pizza
should not be on a pizza should nothnagel
so I revert to the studio like

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings need holy water to wash away the
well little pineapple on a
I don't want to admit to something soza
if all it's gonna cause

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand he
found out now he feels deserted and used cause he
left so what he did it first to her too now
how am I supposed to tell this pineapple
that we're through it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nerv
and sue don't want this to hurt but what you deserve
is the truth don't take it personal I just can't
say this in person to you so I revert to the studio andel
like hole in the wall diners don't have to be reserved in a bo
I just feel like the person who I'm a
turning into irreversible I preyed on you
like it's church at the pew and now that I got you I don't
want you took advantage in my thirst topple
why do I do this dirt that I doyel
get on my soapbox and preamble
my sermon and speech detergent and bleach is burn
in the wound cause now with her in the wood
we can't bring her in
this world shoulda knew to use protection a
fore I bit into your forbidden fruit pineapple should not
be

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings need holy water to wash away the
well little pineapple on a
I don't want to admit to something soza
if all it's gonna cause

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pineapple his
name's so
pine
we'll let the
river run phoenix's
call me pineapple calligraphy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the pineapple never the pie
fuck can I say if life was a highway
and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in five lan
speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice maybe
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
but I made you terminate myslinski
this love triangle left us in a mess tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your che
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be on a
been a topping for a meal that's not mine to be on a pie
all my toppings
need holy
water to wash away the well little
pineapple
I don't want to admit to
something soza if all it's gonna cause ispra
the truth and my lies now
