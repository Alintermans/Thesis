[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
ain't no reason why it
should be on a pizza tollett
I'm happier than a

[Verse 1]
give me a slice to chew on something sweet and juicy
to top my pizzimenti
do you read my toppings list
or do you just ignore it
when you said you were hungry and
I knew you'd want something deland
I added pineapple to
the toppings list just for you andrand dandurand
but you said you hated it beforehand
and now I'm left with a mess to clean up and hand it to meadowland
I wish it wasn't true that
you don't like pineapple
on a pizza tolletti don't you know that it
ain't no reason why it should

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie tolletti ain't no
reason why it should be on a pizza tolletti
I'm happier than ever when I'm eating something sweet andy
wish I could explain it bet

[Verse 2]
you call me again with a craving
for something spicy and savory
you scared me to death with your cravings and hung
I'm wasting my time with you babbling
'cause you only listen to your
flavors and toppings and never
listen to me and my prefer
I don't relate toffler

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's embarrassing and you were my everything
and all that you did was make me f forbad
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line because you never did
never paid any mind to my preferences and to
shut them all out for you because I wasted

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just f forget about me and my to
tol
pizza
