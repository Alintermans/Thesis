[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go payload of pine
apple on display it's aol
ly crime against theophila
if the gods of pizza did speak
they would ban that sweet mis
take a slice and watch you weep a fresh
abomination each
week we were born to love tomato
sauce and cheese no room for fruit's dis
guise I was raised on pepperoni
pineapple's got no place in my cu
isine I was born with good
taste but pineapple's notaro
nni on my plate command

[Pre-Chorus]
a no no

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza I'll worship like a purist at
the altar of tradition I'll tell you my taste
preferences and you can
spit it out with disdain offer me
a classic mar
gherita oh please let me enjoy my meal in
peace take pineapple off my pizza I'll worship
like a purist atlantan
at the altar of tradition I

[Verse 2]
if I'm a fan of the classics then
pineapple's a sacri
lege to keep the pizza gods at
bay drain the whole can of pine
apple chunks get somethin' slimy som
ethin' gross for the main course that
s a sight to see what you
got in the fridge we've a lot
of hungry pizza lovers that
look horrified this is easy
work to avoid that

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza I'll worship like a purist at
the altar of tradition I'll tell you my taste
preferences and you can
spit it out with disdain offer me
a classic mar
gherita oh please let me enjoy my meal in
peace take pineapple off my pizza I'll worship
like a purist atlantan
at the altar of tradition I

[Bridge]
no pineapple allowed when the feast begins no
room for sacrilege in this sacred scene only then a
classic margherita can truly be divine
in the simplicity of its ingredients oh

[Pre-Chorus]
a no no no
no pineo

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza I'll worship like a purist at
the altar of tradition I'll tell you my taste
preferences and you can
spit it out with disdain offer me
a classic mar
gherita oh please let me enjoy my meal in
peace take pineapple off my pizza I'll worship
like a purist atlantan
at the altar of tradition I
