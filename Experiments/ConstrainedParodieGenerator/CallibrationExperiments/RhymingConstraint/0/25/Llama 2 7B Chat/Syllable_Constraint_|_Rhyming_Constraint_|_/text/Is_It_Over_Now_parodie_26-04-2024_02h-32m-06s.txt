[Intro]
is it a crime to put pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once I had a pie that was
sweet and savory delightful
but then you put pinetta
on top of my dream

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later oh
you still can't get it right oh no oh no oh no oh no
you dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
you search in every topping's bed for somethin' greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when I laid down on the box
was it over when you added the pepper
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
uh huh uh huh uh hu

[Verse 2]
when you put ham on top of
my cheese and sauce and on
you lost control of the flav
red blood white snow and blue

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the way you put the
pineapple on top of my dream
oh lord I think about jump
jumping off of very tall pizzas
just to see you come
running and say the one thing I
been wanting but no oh no
no pineapple on my pie
no no no no no no no no no no no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later oh no
you still can't get it right oh no oh no oh no oh no ohio
you dream of my mouth before it called you a lying trapasso
you search in every topping's bed for somethin' greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when I laid down on the box
was it over when you added the pepper
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]

[Bridge]
