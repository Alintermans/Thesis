[Intro]
come on folks gather round and let me say this true

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's taste is alliston
I want you to hold out your hand and refuse
why don't we leave it alone
no more debate
when food preferences collate
pineapple just can't be
the topping that will be staying oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of flavors
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of flavors
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple lovers never
why are you insisting on this error
what kind of taste buds are you
ringing the bell
and pizza purists come to help
your taste preferences live
they just want to know that you'll survive oh oh

[Chorus]
in this world of flavors
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of flavors
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home try new dishes fast internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave tradition behind us two palates
I don't wanna talk about who's ordering it

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know it's not the same asmaras
as it was asmaras
