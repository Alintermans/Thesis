[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret fruit
that pizza chefs refused to mute but
you don't really care for taste I presume it
goes like this with syllables in
the sixth and seventh place a pine
the major clash of flavors that's so fine or

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Verse 2]
your palate was strong but you needed
proof from the toppings you've gusted
her anchovies and olives overwhelmed ya
they smothered your cheese and they mar
red sauce dripped down and they spoiled your art
and from your plate they drew the hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Verse 3]
you say I spoke of pineapple
I don't even know the name
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a blaze of flavor in every
topping it doesn't matterease
the savory or the sweet hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Verse 4]
I did my best to make it right
I couldn't taste so I tried to bite
I've told the truth I didn't come to fight ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of fe
st with nothing on my tongue but halleluj

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Outro]
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this oven I've bickmore
I used to live alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pineapple on the mar
gazing pie love is not ajar
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy pine was moving too
and every bite we drew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to argue with someone who outdrew
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
