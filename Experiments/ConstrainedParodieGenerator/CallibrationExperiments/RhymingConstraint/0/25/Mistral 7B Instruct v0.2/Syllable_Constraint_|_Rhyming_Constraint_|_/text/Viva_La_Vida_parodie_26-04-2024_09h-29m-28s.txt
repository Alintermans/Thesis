[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the pie
seas of cheese would rise when I gave
now in the morning I eat alone
sweep the plates I used to own

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my palate's eyes
listen as the crowd would sigh
now the old king of taste is dead long live
the new king of pizza to
one minute pineapple was
next the toppings closed on me and I found
my pizzas on pillars of disgust and shame

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the disapproval bells a ring
pizza purists voices singling
be my mirror reflecting truth
my honest toppings in a foreign youth
for some reason I can't explain
once you'd gone there was never
never an honest pine
and that was when I ruled the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild sauce
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered toppings and the sound of gro
ans people couldn't believe what I'd come
to be a pineapple ab
for the revolutionaries
just a topping on a lonely string mmmmh aw
who would ever wanna be king of

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the disapproval bells a ring
pizza purists voices singling
be my mirror reflecting truth
my honest toppings in a foreign youth
for some reason I can't explain
I know the pizza police won't call
never an honest pine
but that was when I ruled the pie

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
