[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on aol
but I don't really care for their opinion
it's just not right no matter how
you slice it up or serve it with
it's a flavor that just doesn't fit in with

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 2]
your taste buds may be confused but mine
are not so easily fooled ya
the sweetness of the fruit just doesn't belong
it's like putting ketchup on a
taco or mustard onondaga
it's just not right no matter how you slice it

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 3]
you say I'm just a hater and
I don't understand the cra
but I know that pineapple has no place on
a beautiful pie like pizza should be
it's like putting ranieri
on a sundae or peanut butter on a

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 4]
I did my best to keep an o
pen mind but I just cannizzaro
pineapple on pizza it's a sin it's a
crime against humanity and
it's not something that I can cond
one or turn a blind eye to no mataha

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola
hallelujah hysteria
pineapple on pizzeria
hallelujah hilaria
pineapple on paniagua
hallelujah hacienda
pineapple on pachysandra
hallelujah hagiwara

[Outro]
hallelujah hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
I know that some of you may
think it's cool to be unique and
put pineapple on your pie but to me it
just ain't worth the risk of losing me
I'll stick to the classics andry
cheese and sauce that's all I need to see ya later

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time when pizza was
just cheese and sauce and maybe some
pepperoni or sausage but now it's like
a fruit salad gone wrong and it's just
not right it's not the way that it
should be and I won't be a part of it no

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a world where fruit
and cheese are meant to be but that
world is not this one and it's not the pizza
that I know and love so please don't ins
ult me with your pineapple on a
pizza it's just not something that I can get down
