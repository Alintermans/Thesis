[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
its taste is a cursea bitter
on a slice it does not belong
on a slice it does not belong

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare put it on my dish out spicy
its texture ruins the
harmony of cheese and tomato
harmony of cheese andino

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet pure
pizza was sacred and so sure now
it's tainted by this sweet fruit's reign
I can't abide by this trendy campaign feeling
betrayed by this culinary
travesty that's driving me ins
ane seeing the disunity
of flavors clashing in my brain

[Chorus]
pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice
believer I cannot
pain you've brought me to a breaking point now oh
my taste buds scream in protest so loud
pain you've put me through with pineal
believer I refaat

[Verse 3]
third things third
pray for the sanctity of pizza
pineapple devoured
the harmony that once was ours oh
the harmony that noverco

[Pre-Chorus]
I was hoping for a change
but this topping's here interchange
with olives or mushrooms instead
I'll take my pizza plain instead
plain and simple as it's meant to be enjoyed without
this monstrosity ruining the taste for me hollinshead
ruining the

[Chorus]
pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice
believer I cannot
pain you've brought me to a breaking point now oh
my taste buds scream in protest so loud
pain you've put me through with pineal
believer I refaat

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the dough and the sauce we
have a legacy to up
hold in every slice we
make in every crusty

[Pre-Chorus]
but this topping's here interchangeable with others
more deserving of a spot on top of my pizza brother
more deserving

[Chorus]
pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice
believer I cannot
pain you've brought me to a breaking point now oh
my taste buds scream in protest so loud
pain you've put me through with pineal
believer I refaat
