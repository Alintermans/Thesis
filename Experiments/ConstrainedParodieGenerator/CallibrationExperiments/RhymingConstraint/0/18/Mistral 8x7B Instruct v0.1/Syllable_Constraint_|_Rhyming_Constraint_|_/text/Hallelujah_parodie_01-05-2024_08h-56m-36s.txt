[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for it do ya pov
it goes like this the dough the sauce
the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the baffled chef adds pineapple to it

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no ohio

[Verse 2]
your taste was fine but you needed proof
you tried it once and waterproof
your mouth puckered up and you spit it out
you said it's sweet but not on this
a savory dish you reminis
and from your lips you drew a frown oh pineap

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no ohio

[Verse 3]
you say it's just a trend that's in
I don't even like the skin
but if I did I'd still decline ya oh pine
there's a mix of taste that's quite absurdly
a sweet and savory messy
a cold and broken no to pineapples on

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no ohio

[Verse 4]
I tried it once but it was wrong
I couldn't bear the taste vietcong
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the vietcong
with nothing on my tongue but no to pineap

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no ohio
pineapple no no notaro
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no nintendo
pineapple no no mistero
pineapple no no kokomo
pineapple no no hokkaido
pineapple no no borrero

[Outro]
pineapple no no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I amador
I used to like it before I knew you no
and I've seen your flag on the pizza store
love is not a victory war
it's a cold and it's a broken no to pineap

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going witherow
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I chugoku
the holy ghost was bugaboo
and every bite we drew was no to pineap

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
but all I've ever yakovlev
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who hashemite
it's a cold and it's a broken no to pineap
