[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is
a topping that's just not right in my eyesaid it's a crime
do you ever get that feeling that you
can't shift the tide of disgust
are there some toppings up your sleeve that you
haven't tried to make it more bearable to chewsa
I've dreamt about p nangaku
how many secrets
can you keep before you start to bleedahow many lies can
you tell before you're seen throughahow many to

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from my plate
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for cheese and ham herniate

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
supermarket to buy more
ever thought of

too busy bein'right
to fall for pizzitola

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been wonderin' if your toppings are still
open and ready to consume aftertaste
simmer down and pucker up I'm sorry to interrupt

[Pre-Chorus]

buy more cheese and pepperon

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
was sorta hopin' that you'd stay away from my plate
baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
the nights were mainly made for cheese and ham herniate
do I wanna know if you want me crawlin' back to
the supermarket to buy more pizza toppings that
don't make me sick to my stomach like pineapple does
