[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza should not be the thing to do
it's a crime against
good taste and decency too unfenced

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm revol
in the toppings game I find myself dega
for a
healthier option that's not so strange

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
ain't you tired of the sweet and the
sour too unfenced
ain't it hard to keep it in condensed

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
in the toppings game I find myself longing
for a
healthier option that's not so strange

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the toppings now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the toppings ha shallow
in the toppings ha shallow lowly
in the toppings haavelmo
we're far from the tobacco

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
we're far from the toppings now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the toppings ha shall
in the toppings ha shallow el
in the toppings ha al
we're far from the toppings now
