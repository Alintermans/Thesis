caught in a topping landslide no escape from cheapest
open your eyes look up to the silliest
I'm just a poor boy I need no reforest
because I'm easy come easy go little cheese little pe
any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to pessimist

[Verse 1]
mama just added a
pineapple to the pizza put a frown on my face pulled

gone and thrown it all away for a fruit

come sending shivers down my spine stomach's aching all
the time goodbye everybody gotta

sometimes wish pineapple had never been born
