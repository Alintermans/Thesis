[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I protest against the

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on my pizza israel
the topping in the oven of despair
the burning sensation in
my mouth that I cannot bear
we can't have a slice of paradise with
pineapple on top ohare
and in the night we'll wish this never
ends we'll wish this never ends pineapple
on pizza is aural

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor and I'm so
sorry I cannot taste It tonight I
need a pizza that's done right and
always this strange dis
taste comes creeping on so haunting every
time and as I chew I've had
enough of this abuse of
toppings it's like a betrayal of
flavors will you change your order
and stop this pain tonight stop
this pain tonight pineapple nikolai
has got to go home

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your toppings on me you're alread
the flavor Inside I
miss the old pizza the
old pizza the old pizza the sinead
I miss the old pizza
the old pizzitola

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your toppings on me you're alread
the flavor Inside I
miss the old pizza the
old pizza the old pizza the sinead
I miss the old pizza
the old pizzitola
don't waste your toppings on me you're alread
the flavor Inside I
miss the old pizzuti
old pizza the old pizza the sinead
I miss the old pizza
the old pizzitola

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss the old pizza
I miss theophila
I miss theodora
I miss the old pita
