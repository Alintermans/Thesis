[Verse 1]
I walked into the pizzeria with you
the aroma of melted cheese filled the air
but something about it felt so wrong somehow
and I knew I had to speak up everywhere

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet toppings and my savory cravings we
ordered a pie with pepperoni and sa
but then you said you wanted pineapple too and
I knew our taste in pizza was not the

[Pre-Chorus]
same I couldn't believe it
you wanted something so wrong
on our pizza pie it just didn't belong
oh how could

[Chorus]
you do this to me we had our special
combination and now it's ruined forevermore cause there
we are again in the same
pizzeria and I can't

[Verse 3]
believe you're still insisting on that topping it's like you
want to sabotage our meal and all the memories we had e
very time we ordered a pie it was always just right but
now you're changing it and it's just not tight like our
relationship used to be I can't take it manchester
it's just not the same without that pepperoni
it's like you're trying to erase our history
and replace it with something so unnatural and wrong
like pineapple on a pizza
it's just not right it's just not right it's just not
right it's just not right it's just
not right it's just not right it's just not right it's just not right
it's just not right it's just not right it's just not right it

[Pre-Chorus]
just not right it's just not right
it's just not right it's just not right
it's just not right it's just not right it's just
not right it's just not right it's just

[Chorus]
not right it's just not right it's just not right it's just
not right it's just not right it's just not right it's just not rightist
it's just not right it's just
not right it's just not right it's just
not right it's just not right it's just not right it's just not
right it's just not right it's just not right it's just not right it
s just not right it's just
not right it's just not right it's just not

[Bridge]
right maybe we lost our way in the
toppings maybe we asked for
too much but maybe this pizza was a
masterpiece until
you tore it all up with
pineapple running scared I was
there I remember it all too well and you call me up to
break me like a pizza crust so casually cruel in
the name of being honest I'm a crumpled up
piece of dough lying here because

[Verse 4]
I remember it all all all too well and you're the
reason why I can't eat pizza the
same way again every time you double cross my taste buds I'm in
a new hell every time
you double cross my taste buds I'm in a new
hell the idea you had of me who was she a never needy lov
ely jewel whose shine reflects on
you not weeping in a party bathroom
some pizza lover
asking me what happened you that's what happened
you you who charmed my taste buds with your pepperon
I and sausage but then you watched me watch you put pineapple on
our pie and break all the rules all the rules all the rules

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my toppings and I walk home stone
but you keep my old pepperoni from that first
pie it reminds you of innocence and it smells like
me you can't get rid of
it because you remember it all

[Chorus]
too well yeah you do you remember it
all too well yeah you do you remember it all too
well yeah you do you re
member it all too well yeah you
do you remember ita
ll too well yeah you do
you remember itty
bitty boo honeydew
you do you remember
it all too well yeah you do you

[Verse 6]
I was never good at topping jokes but the punchline goes like
this pineapple on a pizza it's just not
right and I'm a soldier who's returning
half my taste buds I'm a soldier who's return
ing half my taste buds I'm a soldier
who's returning half my taste buds I'm aven
ging the pizza that we had
and how it tasted as it fell I re
member it all too well I re
