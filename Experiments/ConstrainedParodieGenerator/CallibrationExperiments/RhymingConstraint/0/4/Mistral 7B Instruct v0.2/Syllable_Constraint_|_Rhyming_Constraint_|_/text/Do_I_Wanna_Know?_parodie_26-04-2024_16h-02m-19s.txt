[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clings like something in
the middle of your slice and makes
your taste buds recoil and pine for something
more refined than this tropical combination's scheme
how many palates cancelling
'cause there's this dish I found
that makes me think of food gone wrong an' I serve it on repeat
until I'm full and groan in disbelief at what

[Pre-Chorus]
is this flavor's fate if we both partake in this
unconventional pairing that's hard to take away
we both know that the nights were made for trying new
combinations but this one's a mistake andante

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to cheese
ever thought of ordering
when cranberries
have rosaries
'cause I always ve
got a hankering
for the classics newbury
now I've taiwanese
crawlin' back toby

[Verse 2]
so have you got the nerve
to add this fruit to savory dishes
and if so I wanna know what compuser
vegetables and meats deserve to be paired with something pure
simmer down an' pucker up I'm sorry to interrupt it
's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying tollett
but I don't know if you feel the same as pit

[Pre-Chorus]
is this flavor's fate if we both partake in this
unconventional pairing that's hard to take away
we both know that the nights were made for trying new
combinations but this one's a mistake andante

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to classic combos we know
ever thought of ordering
when cravings call andreano
'cause I always do andreano ando
maybe I'm too busy being true to
the flavors I've always knew and
falling for something new oh
now I've thought itoh
crawlin' back toto

[Outro]
is this flavor's fate if we both partake in this
unconventional pairing that's hard to take away
we both know that the nights were made for trying new
combinations but this one's a mistake andante
is this flavor's fate too busy being true to pine
ever thought of ordering something more divine and
do you want me crawlin' back to you again and again
