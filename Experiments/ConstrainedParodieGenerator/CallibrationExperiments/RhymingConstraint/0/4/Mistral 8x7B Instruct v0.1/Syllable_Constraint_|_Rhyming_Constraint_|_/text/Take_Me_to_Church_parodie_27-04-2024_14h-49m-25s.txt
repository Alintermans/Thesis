pping that's a no go payload of pine
apple on display it's aol
ly crime against theophila
if the gods of pizza did speak
they would ban that sweet mis
take a slice and watch you weep physique

this church of pizza offers no
pineapple allowed she decrees the
only taste allowed is mozzarell
a and tomato spiral
I was born to hate italy
but I love my pizza

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

the shrine of pineapple treason I'll confess all
my sins and you can toss the
pineapple in the bin wherewith
it belongs a
good god let me give you my life take mittelstadt
to the pizza parlor I'll devour like a
beast at the shrine ofc

[Verse 2]
if I'm a pagan of the good times
my pizza's the sunlight
to keep the gods of pizza on
my side she demands a sac
rifice of ham and cheese and bacon
something savory for the main
course that's a fine pellicane
looking crust what you got in
the oven we've aflatoxin
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hungry work

[Chorus]

pizza parlor I'll devour like a beast at
the shrine of pineapple treason I'll confess all
my sins and you can toss the
pineapple in the bin wherewith
it belongs a
good god let me give you my life take mittelstadt
to the pizza parlor I'll devour like a
beast at the shrine ofc
pineapple treason I'll confess all

[Bridge]
no pineapple allowed when the ritual starts
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle art
in the madness and dough of that sad food scene we
only then are human only then are wearily

[Pre-Chorus]
ay caramba
monism a

[Chorus]
take me to the
pizza parlor I'll devour like a beast at
the shrine of pineapple treason I'll confess all
my sins and you can toss the
pineapple in the bin wherewith
it belongs a
good god let me give you my life take mittelstadt
to the pizza parlor I'll devour like a
beast at the shrine ofc
pineapple treason I'll confess all
