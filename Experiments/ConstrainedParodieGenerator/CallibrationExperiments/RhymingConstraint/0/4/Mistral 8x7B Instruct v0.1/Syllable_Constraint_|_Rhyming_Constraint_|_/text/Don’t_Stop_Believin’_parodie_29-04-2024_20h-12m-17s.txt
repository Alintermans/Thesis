[Verse 1]
just a local townie with a pizza craving
craving something more than just plain cheese and tom
just a foodie born and raised in new york city
pizza lover on a quest to find onecomm

[Verse 2]
a slice in a crowded pizzer
topped with pineapple and hammy
for a taste they can't deny
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
critics waiting
on the streets and online too
their reviews searching in the night
pizza lovers
eating just to find delight hid
somewhere in the pie tonight

[Verse 3]
working hard to get a taste
everyone wants a bite to
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more slice

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
some are born to eatable
oh the meal never ends it
goes on and on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
critics waiting
on the streets and online too
their reviews searching in the night
pizza lovers
eating just to find delight hid
somewhere in the pie tonight

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop hating don
express your feeling on
pizza lovers
don't stop hollomon
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop hambleton
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
