[Verse 1]
first things first
pineapple's got no place on a pizza
its taste is a cursea bitter
on a slice it does not belong
on a slice it does not belong

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you dare put it on my dish out spicy
its texture ruins the
harmony of cheese and tomato
harmony of cheese andino

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet pure
pizza was sacred and so sure now
it's tainted by this sweet fruit's reign
I can't abide by this trendy campaign feeling
betrayed by this culinary
travesty that's driving me ins
ane seeing the disunity
of flavors clashing in my brain

[Chorus]
pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice
believer I cannot
pain you've brought me to a breaking point now oh
my taste buds scream in protest so loud
pain you've put me through with pineal
believer I cannot

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a plea to the chefs up above
may they ban this savored
abomination from their menu oh
from their menu oh noverco

[Pre-Chorus]
I was hoping for a change
but this trend keeps spreading like a
stain on the reputation of
pizza I adore and cherish
cherish from the core of my being oh noverco
pain you've brought me to a breaking point now oh oh inglish
disunity

[Chorus]
pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice
believer I cannot
pain you've brought me to a breaking point now oh
my taste buds scream in protest so loud
pain you've put me through with pineal
believer I cannot

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the dough and the sauce yeah
you're the enemy of the
pizza I once adored oh
the pizza I once adored

[Pre-Chorus]
but this trend keeps spreading like a stain on the rep of
pizza I adore and cherish cherish from the core of me
pain you've brought me

[Chorus]
pain you've put me through with pineapple
believer I am not
pain you've caused me with this topping choice
believer I cannot
pain you've brought me to a breaking point now oh
my taste buds scream in protest so loud
pain you've put me through with pineal
believer I cannot
