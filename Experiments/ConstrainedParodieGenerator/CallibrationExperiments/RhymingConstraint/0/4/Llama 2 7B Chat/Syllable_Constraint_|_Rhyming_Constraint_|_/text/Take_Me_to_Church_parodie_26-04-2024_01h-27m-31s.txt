[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie
it's a crime against humanity
don't even make me crybaby
it's like a joke that's not funny
I can't believe you'd even
try to put it on a
pizza that's supposed to beverlin
sweet and savory in
perfect harmony but instead it
ruins the whole thing like a spo
sour note in a song that's supposed
to be a beautiful melody
but instead itty's justy
a pineapple on aksamit
please take it off I beg

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no oh
no nobuo

[Chorus]
don't put a
pineapple on a pizza it's a sinful sight
it's like a crime against taste buds so pure and bright
please don't destroy the cul
delicate balance of flavors with
that abuellah
pineapple on a pizza it's just acoly
no no no no no no no no no no no no
please don't do it topple
the pizza gods will smite you downright

[Verse 2]
I know you think it's funny but it
ain't nobody la
gonna put a pineapple on
a pizza that's meant to be
a savory delight not a sweet
treat for dessert lovers only
it's like a sincerity
in a relationship that
ain't meant to be alegrett
so please don't even try it
it's a pineapple

[Chorus]
don't put a
pineapple on a pizza it's a sinful sight
it's like a crime against taste buds so pure and bright
please don't destroy the cul
delicate balance of flavors with
that abuellah
pineapple on a pizza it's just acoly
no no no no no no no no no no no no
please don't do it topple

[Bridge]

pizza lovers everywhere so listen up and heed this
warning don't even think about it or you
will face the wrath of the pizza gods and itochu

[Pre-Chorus]

no no no no no no no no no no no no
please don't do it topple
the pizza gods will smite you downright
