[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza should not be seen or

[Verse 1]
don't put it
it's not a fruit that belongs
on a pie that's hot and cheesy too soon or
it'll make a mess and ruin
the flavor of
the sauce and the cheese and the meat
can't you see it's just not
right for pineapple on a pizza please

[Chorus]
it's not the same as it
was in the old days when pizza was
just cheese and sauce and pe
toppings that made sense and tereza
it's not the same asia
it's not the same as it

[Verse 2]
it's a fruit that
belongs on a plate orcutt
in a salad or on a sandwich or
in a fruit bowl with some ber
other fruits that
go well together but on a
pizza it's just not the same
it's like putting ketchup on a burger or

[Chorus]
it's not the same as it
was in the old days when pizza was
just cheese and sauce and pe
toppings that made sense and tereza
it's not the same asia
it's not the same as it

[Bridge]
so let's all agree to disagree and
leave pineapple off the pizza tree and just enjoy
the classic flavors that we know and love
and don't even get me started on anchovies

[Outro]
pine
as it was
you know it's not the same asmaras
it was in the old days
