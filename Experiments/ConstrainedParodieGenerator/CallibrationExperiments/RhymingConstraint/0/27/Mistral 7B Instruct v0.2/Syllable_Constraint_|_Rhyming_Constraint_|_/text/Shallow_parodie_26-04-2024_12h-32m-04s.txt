[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something dear
is a pineapple on your pizza
really clear or just
an unwelcome twist to your palest

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm shrinking
in all the good bites I find myself pining
for plain
and in the bad slices I despair

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something friend
are you tired of this pineapple trend
or just pine for the
traditional flavors we once knew and

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm shrinking
in all the good bites I find myself pining
for plain
and in the bad slices I despair

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end of the pizza pan
I'll never meet the cheese
crash through the toppings where they can't tan us
we're far from the peppery

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pine apple less
in the sha pine apple less low low
in the sha pine apple less
we're far from the peppery

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end of the pizza pan
I'll never meet the cheese
crash through the toppings where they can't tan us
we're far from the peppery

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pine apple
in the sha pine apple less lowell
in the sha pineapple
we're far from the peppery
