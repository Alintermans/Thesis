[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a reason tonight
pineapple just isn't

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to ponder something tasty
to create austerity
to top our savory
do you taste my recipes
or do you skip our decree
when you said you'd try italy
was our creation on
I knew when I asked you to join us atari
you'd do the opposite oflaherty
and we'd end up more appalled by the sight of pineapple onofre
so if you really wanna
know the secret to our
pizza's perfect harmony and balance true ohoh
no pineapple on our pie

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza pie is
right we're happier than ever tonight wishing for
a reason why we could explain it better ohoh wehmeier
pineapple just isn't right

[Verse 2]
you call us again with pineapple
in your hand under the influence
you confused us to death with your insistence
but we only listen to our cul
inarial intuition
we don't relate to you pine
'cause we'd never treat our dish this
unpalatable younis

[Verse 3]
and we don't spread rumors about you on the inter
net never told anyone anything
pineapple related we'd rather keep it class
and all that you did was make us cowering
disgusted by the sight of pineapple
so don't waste our time weaving
and don't try to make us feel ashamed by the taste of pine
apple we could talk about every time that you
showed up on time with fresh ingredients but we'd have an
empty plate because you never did andre

[Outro]
you ruined our perfect
pairing of flavors misunderstood
made our pizza your own
just leave us alone pineapple nope no
no
goddam
no
no no
pine go
