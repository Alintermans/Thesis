the crust was it over when the toppings were
chosen with care was it over
when the pineapple ruined it all
oh pineapple why must you be so divis

[Verse 2]
for a pie that's free from the
tropical fruitlessly
searching for aesthetically
pleasing combinations

[Bridge]
and did you think we wouldn't notice
the discordant flav
ors that you bring to the table
oh pineapple why must you
be so bold and so loud and so wrong
in every way
jumping into the mix like you
belong there at all just to
ruin the experience
for us all no no no no no no no no
