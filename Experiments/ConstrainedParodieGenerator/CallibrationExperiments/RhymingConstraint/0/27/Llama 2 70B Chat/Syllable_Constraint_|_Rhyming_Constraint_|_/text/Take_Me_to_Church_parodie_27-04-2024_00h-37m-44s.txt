[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a crime
it's the pineapple on top that's the
problem ain't no way topeka
should be on my pie no way I
should've ordered something else that
day pineapple doesn't
belong there I'll never say pigott
if the pizza gods did
speak they'd say it's a sin take a pe
at my pizza and weep a fresh
disappointment each week pineapple
on pizza is blasphemy my friends
tell me it's a travesty
my taste buds offer noisily
she's the last true pizza

[Pre-Chorus]

pizzeria I'll worship at the shrine of your
lies I'll tell you my cravings and you can sharp in
your knife offer me that death
less pizza oh good pizza godkin
let mejia
give you my life take me to the pizzeria
I'll worship at the shrine of your lies I'll tellin
my cravings and you can le

[Verse 2]

my lover's the cheese that
