[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we
must face this culinary war
you might think it's tasty but it's a flawed notion
it looks absurd on a pie
it's just not right my friend oh

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but still weirton
tempted by the sweetness of theism
on our pizza slic

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
face this battle of tastes unjust
we gotta get away from this topping
we gotta get away from this
pizza abomination it

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and give it a
thought before you take a bite
it's just not meant to be on
a pizza pie it's a mistake we can
avoid if we just open
our minds and try something

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but still weirton
tempted by the sweetness of theism
on our pizza slic

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
face this battle of tastes unjust
we gotta get away from this topping it
we gotta get away from this
pizza abomination it

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but still weirton
tempted by the sweetness of theism
on our pizza slic

[Bridge]
we don't taste enough
we should explore and
expand our palate
before it's all too
late we've been here done
that with pineapple

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on it
it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from this monstrosity
we got to get away from this pineapple crime
we got to get away from this
pizza disaster we got to
get away from this pineapple
