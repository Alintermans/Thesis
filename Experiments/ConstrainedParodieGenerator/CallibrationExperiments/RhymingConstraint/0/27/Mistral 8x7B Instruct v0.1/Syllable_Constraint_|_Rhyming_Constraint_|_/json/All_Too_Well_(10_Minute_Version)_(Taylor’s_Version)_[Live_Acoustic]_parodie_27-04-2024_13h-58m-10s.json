your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nI love you guys so much [/INST]\nParody:\n[Verse 1]\nI took a bite of that pie with pineapple\nmy taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow\nthe slimy fruit mixed with cheese and tomato\nI spit it out and now I'm telling you how\n\n[Verse 2]\noh that sweet and savory combination fell flat\nlike a bad joke at a party you can't\ntake back the taste still lingers in my mouth like a\nbad dream that I can't seem to forget or\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nshake off the thought of pineap\nplease just leave it off my plate\nI'll be okay but I'm not in a good state now\noh oh oh\n\n[Chorus]\ncause there it is again that slimy slice of\npizza topped with fruit it's not so nice I'd rather not recol\nlect it all too well but there\nit is again that pineapple\n\n[Verse 3]\nthe can of pineapple chunks near the pepperoni jar\nit's a crime to put it on a pizza and call it a delamar\nyet here it is on my slice ruining my appetite and\nI can't help but think of the audacity of\nputting pineapple on pizza it's a sin and aversive\nand I can't help but cringe every time it\nhappens again and again it's a tragedy and\nI can't help but wonder why anyone would do it\nto a perfectly good pizza\ncheck the toppings and come back swearing it's the\nsame but it's not it's a mon\nstrosity and I can't help but feel betrayed by it\nall and I can't help but think of itty bitty\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\npineapple chunks in a can\nplease

between us I can\ntell you it's not a good idea\n\n[Bridge]\nwell maybe we got lost in translation\nmaybe I asked for too much\nbut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'til you topped it all up\nrunning scared I was there\nI remember it all too well\nand you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nso casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'cause I remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 4]\nthey say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell\nevery time I see pineapple on\na pizza I can't help but feel betrayed by the culinary\nworld and the audacity\nof putting pineapple on pizza it's a\nsin and I can't help but think of the audacity of it all and\nI can't help but feel like a fool\nfor ever thinking it could work outgunned\nand I can't help\nbut wonder why anyone would do it to\na perfectly good pizza and I can't help\nbut feel like a victim of a cruel joke and I can't help\nbut think of it as a personal attack on me and\n\n[Verse 5]\ntime won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to forget the taste of pineapple on pizza but it's still\nthere in the back of my mind like a bad memory\nand I can't help but feel like aphrodite\nwhen I see a pizza without pineapple on\nit and I can't help but feel like a new person\nwithout the burden of pine\napple on pizza and I can't\n\n[Chorus]\nhelp but think of it as a personal\nvictory every time I see a pizza free\nof pineapple and it\nreminds me of the good old days\nwhen pizza was sacred and\npineapple was only\nfor hawaiian proudfit\nfor the brave andraki\nfor the ones who know what\nit's like to suffer and survive\n\n[Verse 6]\nand I was never good at hiding my disdain for pineap\nplease just leave it off my plate and I'll be fine\nfrom the days of pineapple on pizza\nI'm a survivor who's returning without\nthe burden of pineapple on me\nand did the pineapple bruise make you blueberry\njust between us did the pine\napple
