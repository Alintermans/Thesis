[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue and mad
wish I could explain it clearer
but it just tastes soyka

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write a new disaster
to tell me what to chew and
do you taste my pizza here
or do you skip the layer here
when you said you'd give it a chance
was it even on your tray
I knew when I asked you to try it slow sight
you'd do the opposite of what you said
and I'd end up with a plate of dismayed delight don't say it isn
't fair you clearly weren't unpre
pared that you made me culin
arily impaired so if you really wanna know
why pineapple's not allowed here

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue and
mad wish I could explain it clearer but it just tastes
soyka icky icky icky oh no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no

[Verse 2]
you call me again with pineapple
on your slice in your hand I sigh and
drive away under the influence of dis
gust you scared me to death but I amble
away to find a better
slice you don't relate to me
you don't relate to me no
'cause I'd never treat mexico

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about hawaii on the net
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that shit's embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me want to add
some ham and jalape√±o instead so
don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad I could talk about how
pineapple's got no place on a savory dish but
I'd have an empty line cause it just doesn't fit here in
my world of pepperoni and marriott

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone yeah fuck you
ah
goddam
ah
fuck you
fuck you
