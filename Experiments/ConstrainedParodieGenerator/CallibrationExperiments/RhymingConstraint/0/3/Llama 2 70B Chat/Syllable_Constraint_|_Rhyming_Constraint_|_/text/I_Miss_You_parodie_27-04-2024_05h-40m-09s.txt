[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I protest against the

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple
on my pizza israel
the topping in the oven of despair
the burning sensation in
my mouth that I cannot bear
we can't have a slice of paradise with
pineapple on top it's just
not right and it's just not nice we'll wish
this pizza was never served we'll wish this
never ends pragmatists

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor and the taste
I cannot enjoy this pizza with such
a topping this strange and odd thing
comes creeping on so
disgusting every time and as I che
I counted the slices that
I cannot eat because of
the pineapple on top like a bad
decision that I cannot take
back will you take it off and
stop this pain tonight stop this pain tonight
I don't want this

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's al
ready the worst topping
I miss you I miss you
I don't want pineapple on my pizza
I miss you I miss you
don't waste your time on

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple it's al
ready the worst topping
I miss you I miss you
I don't want pineapple on my pizza
I miss you I miss you
don't waste your time on
pineapple it's already the worst topping
I miss you I miss you
I don't want pannu
pineapple on my pizza I miss you mal
you I don't want king
pineapple on my pe

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you
