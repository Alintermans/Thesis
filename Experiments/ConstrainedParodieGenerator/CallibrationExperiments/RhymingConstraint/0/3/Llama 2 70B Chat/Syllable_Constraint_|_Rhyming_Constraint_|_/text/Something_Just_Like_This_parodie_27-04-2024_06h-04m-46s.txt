[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for
a long time now it's true
I've tried alligator
and chicken too igu
but one topping that
I just can't abide
is pineapple it's just not right it ruins the taste

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no pignataro
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza that's the beat
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the hits
the pizza toppings they
all say it's a myth no
pineapple on pizza
it's just not worth the risk
it's not the kind of topping that I want to

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you want to go how
much you want to risk I
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no pignataro
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza that's the beat

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like
this doo doo doo doo doo do

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no pignataro
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza that's the beat
I want something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
