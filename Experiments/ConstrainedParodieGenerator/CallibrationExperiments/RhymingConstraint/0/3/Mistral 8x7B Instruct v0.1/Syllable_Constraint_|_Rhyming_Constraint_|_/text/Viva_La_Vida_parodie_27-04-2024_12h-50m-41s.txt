[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I once enjoyed a slice
topped with pineapple so nice foot
now in the morning I take a bite
of a pizza thatcherite

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to love the taste
but now it's ruined by the pine's
juicy sweetness overpow
ers the savory sauce andriano
one bite and I held my breath
next I spit it out in ste
alth and found the crust just as bland as death
on a pizza that's built on lies and deceit

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of outrage ringing loud
hawaiian pizza lovers form a
crowd be my protest sign and shield
my comrades in the fight to yield afield
for some reason I can't explain
once you've tasted pineapple
on a pizza no truth
will ever be the same again

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild trend
that brought the pineapple in the
end shattered the trust of pizza fans
revolutionaries wait for my head
on a silver plate just a
puppet controlled by theora
oh who would ever wanna be king of a
pizza topped with shame and sinful things

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of outrage ringing loud
hawaiian pizza lovers form a
crowd be my protest sign and shield
my comrades in the fight to yield afield
for some reason I can't explain
I know saint peter won't call my name
never an honest word
but that was when pineapple ruled

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
hear the bells of outrage
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
ringing loud and clear for
all to hear the truth andantino
be my protest sign and
shield my comrades in the fight to
yield afield for some re
ason I can't explain butera
I know saint peter won
't call my name never an honest word
but that was when pineap
ple ruled the pizza world oh oh oh oh
