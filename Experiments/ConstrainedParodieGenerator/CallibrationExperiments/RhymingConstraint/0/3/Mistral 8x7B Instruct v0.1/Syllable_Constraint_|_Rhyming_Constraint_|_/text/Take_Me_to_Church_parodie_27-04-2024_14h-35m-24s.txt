[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go payload of pine
apple on display it's aol
ly crime against theophila
if the gods of pizza did speak
they would ban that sweet mis
take a slice and watch you weep a fresh
abomination each
week we were born to love tomato
sauce and cheese no room for fruit's dis
guise I was raised on pepperoni
pineapple's got no place in my cu
isine I was born tofu
dge but I'll never abbado
w it command

[Pre-Chorus]
ahhh no pine
apple on mine

[Chorus]
take me to a
pizza joint I'll eat what's right no ham and pineap
please I'll tell you my order don't add that shame
on top offer me a slice
of heaven not a pineapple grave
take mezuzah
pizza joint I'll eat what's right no ham and pineap
please I'll tell you my order don't add that shame
on top offer me a slice
of heaven not a pineapple grave

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the old ways
my pizza's got the right
toppings to keep the gods at bay
they demand a sacred pie
no room for sweet or tangy fruit it
's a sin to add it to the top
that's a fine lookin' high horse
what you got in the oven
we've a lot of starvin' faithful
that looks tasty that looks plenty
this is hungry work

[Chorus]
take me to a
pizza joint I'll eat what's right no ham and pineap
please I'll tell you my order don't add that shame
on top offer me a slice
of heaven not a pineapple grave
take mezuzah
pizza joint I'll eat what's right no ham and pineap
please I'll tell you my order don't add that shame
on top offer me a slice
of heaven not a pineapple grave

[Bridge]
no pineapple allowed when the feast begins no
room for sweet or tangy fruit in this sacred den only
then I am a true pizza lover only then
I am satisfied no pineapple allowed in this

[Pre-Chorus]
ahhh no pineap
ple on mine stre

[Chorus]
take me to a
pizza joint I'll eat what's right no ham and pineap
please I'll tell you my order don't add that shame
on top offer me a slice
of heaven not a pineapple grave
take mezuzah
pizza joint I'll eat what's right no ham and pineap
please I'll tell you my order don't add that shame
on top offer me a slice
of heaven not a pineapple grave
