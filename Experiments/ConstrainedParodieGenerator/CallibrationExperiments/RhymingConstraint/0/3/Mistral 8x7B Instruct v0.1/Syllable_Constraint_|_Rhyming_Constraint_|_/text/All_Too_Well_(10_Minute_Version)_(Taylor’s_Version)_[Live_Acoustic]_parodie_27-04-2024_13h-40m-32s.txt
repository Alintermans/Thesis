[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow
the slimy fruit mixed with cheese and tomato
I spit it out and now I'm telling you how

[Verse 2]
oh that sweet and savory combination fell flat
like a bad joke at a party you can't
take back the taste still lingers in my mouth like a
bad dream that I can't seem to forget or

[Pre-Chorus]
shake off the thought of pineap
please just leave it off my plate
I'll be okay but I'm not in a good state now
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it is again that slimy slice of
pizza topped with fruit it's not so nice I'd rather not recol
lect it all too well but there
it is again that pineapple

[Verse 3]
the can of pineapple chunks near the pepperoni jar
it's a crime to put it on a pizza and call it a delamar
yet here it is on my slice ruining my appetite and
I can't help but think of the audacity of
putting pineapple on pizza it's a sin and aversive
and I can't help but cringe every time it
happens again and again it's a tragedy and
I can't help but wonder why anyone would do it
to a perfectly good pizza
check the toppings and come back swearing it's the
same but it's not it's a mon
strosity and I can't help but feel betrayed by it
all and I can't help but think of itty bitty

[Pre-Chorus]
pineapple chunks in a can
please just leave it off my plate and
I'll be okay but I'm not in a good
state now oh oh oh chamberland

[Chorus]
cause there it is again that slimy slice of hell
pizza topped with fruit it's not so nice I'd rather not recol
lect it all too well but
there it is again that pineap
please just leave it off my plate and I'll be okay but
I'm not in a good state now oh oh oh halseylandia
just between us I can
tell you it's not a good idea

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you topped it all up
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all too well

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time I see pineapple on
a pizza I can't help but feel betrayed by the culinary
world and the audacity
of putting pineapple on pizza it's a
sin and I can't help but think of the audacity of it all and
I can't help but feel like a fool
for ever thinking it could work outgunned
and I can't help
but wonder why anyone would do it to
a perfectly good pizza and I can't help
but feel like a victim of a cruel joke and I can't help
but think of it as a personal attack on me and

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to forget the taste of pineapple on pizza but it's still
there in the back of my mind like a bad memory
and I can't help but feel like aphrodite
when I see a pizza without pineapple on
it and I can't help but feel like a new person
without the burden of pine
apple on pizza and I can't

[Chorus]
help but think of it as a personal
victory every time I see a pizza free
of pineapple and it
reminds me of the good old days
when pizza was sacred and
pineapple was only
for hawaiian proudfit
for the brave andraki
for the ones who know what
it's like to suffer and survive

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at hiding my disdain for pineap
please just leave it off my plate and I'll be fine
from the days of pineapple on pizza
I'm a survivor who's returning without
the burden of pineapple on me
and did the pineapple bruise make you blueberry
just between us did the pine
apple ruin it all for you too and
I can't help but think of it
as a personal victory

[Outro]
just between us I don't remember it all too well
just between us I don't remember italtel
just between us I don't remember it all too well atwell
just between us I don't remember
it all too well and I cannister
remember it all too welliver
just between us I don't remember it
all too well and I can't help butcher
remember it all too welliver
just between us I dondlinger
remember it all too well and
I can't help but think of it asher
a personal victory andler
just between us I dondlinger
