[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
pepperoni andries
and bbq with a
cheese that's all aflow
but pineapple just won
through to me it doesn't belong on a pizza gone

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but they said where d'you wanna go
how far will you pursue
I'm not looking for a slice that
is too exotic and new
just something I can
dig into and che
wanna taste that's tried and true
not something bta
want something just like this ek

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo do do
doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
the classics and the new
ham and pineapple please
but pineapple just won
through to me it doesn't
belong on a pizza
I'm not the kind of person that it fits with

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk I
'm not looking for a slice that's too
exotic and new just som
ething I can dig
into and chew on
wanna taste that's true and tried
not something bouchillon

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like this
I want something just like this

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this

doo doo doo doo do do
oh I want something just like this

doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]

how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a slice that
is too exotic and new
just something I can
dig into and che
wanna taste that's tried and true
not something bta
want something just like this ek

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
