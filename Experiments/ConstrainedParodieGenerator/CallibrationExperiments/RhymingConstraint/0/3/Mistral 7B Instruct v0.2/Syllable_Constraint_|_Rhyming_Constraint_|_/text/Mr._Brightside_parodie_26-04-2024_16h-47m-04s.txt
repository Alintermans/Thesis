[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta keep it cool because I hate the pineap
it started out on a pie but now it's on a pizza
now I'm cringin' hard and my taste buds aretta
now I'm reachin' for water and she's orderin
while he's savourin' his slice and she's smorin' on
now they're sharin' a laugh and my appetite's
gone and it's all in the

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's savourin' his taste
he's savourin' his fe
let me go
'cause I just can't partake it's drivin' me
and takin' the blame

[Chorus]
pineapplesity turnin' gourmets to
swimmin' through savory blues
chokin' on your excuses
but it's just the price I pay
destiny ishikawa
open up my disabuse
'cause I'm mr reject

[Guitar Solo]

comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine yeah
gotta keep it cool because I hate the pineap
it started out on a pie but now it's on a pizza
now I'm cringin' hard and my taste buds aretta
