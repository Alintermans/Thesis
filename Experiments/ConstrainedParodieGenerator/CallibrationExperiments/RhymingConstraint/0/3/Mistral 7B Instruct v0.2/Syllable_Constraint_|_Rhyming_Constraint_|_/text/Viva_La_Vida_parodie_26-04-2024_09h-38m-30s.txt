[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the pie
seas of cheese would rise when I gave
now in the morning I eat alone
sweep the plates I used to own

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my palate's eyes
listen as the crowd would sigh
now the old king of pizza's dead long live
another topping on the
next the sauce wasilewski
and I discovered that my pies stand on
pillars of pineapple and pepperoni

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear controversy bells a ringin
pizza purists voices singin' in
be my mirror reflecting truth
my argument in a culinary
for some reason I can't explain
once you'd gone there was never
never an honest bite
and that was when I ruled the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild sauce
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered toppings and the sound of che
people couldn't believe what I'd become
pineapple revolution
on a silver plate forbidden
just a topping on a lonely string mmmmhhh aw
who would ever wanna be the king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear controversy bells a ringin
pizza purists voices singin' in
be my mirror reflecting truth
my argument in a culinary
for some reason I can't explain
I know the pizza police won't call
never an honest bite
but that was when I ruled the pie
