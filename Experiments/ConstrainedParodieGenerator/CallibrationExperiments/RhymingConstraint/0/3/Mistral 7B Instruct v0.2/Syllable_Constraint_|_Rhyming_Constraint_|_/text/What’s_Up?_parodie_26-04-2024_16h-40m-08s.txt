[Verse 1]
twenty five years with this strange
tryin' to figure out why pineapple on
a pizza is such a
mystery to me and you know I've tried
to understand this bizarre brotherhood of mankind
for the love of pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm taking a bite
just to get it all out what's in my sight
and I'm feeling a little peculiar about
this topping that's causing such a ruckus and a shout
so I wake in the morning and I step out
and I take a deep breath and I get
really high on

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyeyey heyeyeyey hey
I said hey
what's this pineapple on pizza
heyeyeyey heyeyeyey hey hemenway
I said hey
what's this pineapple onawa

[Bridge]
ooh o

[Verse 2]
and I pine
oh my god dobberstein
I pine all the time
in this kitchen of life
and I pine
oh my god doberstein
I pine every single night
for innovation

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm taking a bite
just to get it all out what's in my sight
and I'm feeling a little peculiar about
this topping that's causing such a ruckus and a shout
so I wake in the morning and I step out
and I take a deep breath and I get
really high on

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyeyey heyeyeyey hey
I said hey

heyeyeyey heyeyeyey hey hemenway
I said hey

tryin' to figure out why pineapple on
