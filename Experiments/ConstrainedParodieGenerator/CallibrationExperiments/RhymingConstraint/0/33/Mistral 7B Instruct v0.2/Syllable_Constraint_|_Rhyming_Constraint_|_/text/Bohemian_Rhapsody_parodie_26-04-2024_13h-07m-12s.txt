[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping fiasco I'm stuck in a pineapple land
open your eyes and see this fruitopia
I'm just a simple pie lover butala
easy come easy go with ham and cheese or pepperoni
but pineapple on top just doesn't sit right with mexicana

[Verse 1]
mama just put a slice
of pineapple on my pizza pie and I died inside
mama pizza life had just
begun but now I've ruined it with this
mama ooh pineapple surprise oh no
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my pizza's done
sends shivers down my spine with every bite so un
goodbye my taste buds I've got to go now
gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
mama ooh pineapple breeze I don
't wanna pineapple pie
sometimes I wish I'd never ordered at all

[Guitar Solo]
