[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza controversy and
the truth and my lies now

[Verse 1: Eminem]
it's a food fight in the kitchen heated and
toppings misplaced with no respect
pineapple on a pizza is a
gastronomic debate that we can't neglect
it's a battle of taste buds and texture inland
some say it's sweet and savory combined
but others claim it's a culinary crime scene unfold
and you don't mess with a dish that's been told to be bold and untold
'cause they love tradition and the
pineapple purists' passion runs deep and wide and bold and
they've devised some plan to save the day beforehand
so they've been on the web lately spreading the word and the
rumors that pineapple is a
disaster and a disaster in the making and
I know they're using me to try to sway the debate and I don
't care hi suzanne but I shoulda said goodland
after the first bite I thought it was al

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza controversy and
the truth and my lies now

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a classic dish turned into a fusion
it was come and get it or take it or leave it
but now it's a hot topic of debate and
discussion and I'm feeling the pressure to
speak my mind but what can I say to you andrea
it's hard to find the words I'm reserved nervous andrew
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person tofu
so I revert to the studio like a hole in the wall diner
don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
is irreversible I preyed on your love forsythia
and now that I got you I donapria
took advantage in my thomasina
why do I do this thing that I do
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
pineapple and cheese is burning the wound
'cause now with you in the wom
we can't bring it in this world shoulda knew
to use protection before I bit into your forbidden
food

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza controversy and
the truth and my lies now

more lie to tell our unborn child pineap

gonna cause is a pineapple
on a pizza controversy and the truthful
lies now are falling like
