[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the pie
seas of cheese would rise when I gave
now in the morning I eat alone
sweep the plates I used to own

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my palate's eyes
listen as the crowd would sigh
now the old king of taste is dead eli
one minute pineapple was
next a topping closed theda
and I discovered that my pizzas stand
on pillars of sweet and savory bandstand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear controversy bells a ringin
pizza purists voices singin' in
be my mirror reflecting truth
my toppings in a flavorful stew booth
for some reason I can't explain
once you'd gone there was never
never an honest bite
and that was when I ruled the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild sauce
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered flavors and the sound of gro
answers couldn't believe what I'd become
pineapple revolution
waits for my head on ackerman
just a topping on a lonely string mmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmh
aw who would ever wanna be king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear controversy bells a ringin
pizza purists voices singin' in
be my mirror reflecting truth
my toppings in a flavorful stew booth
for some reason I can't explain
I know the pizza police won't call
never an honest bite
but that was when I ruled the pie

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohohohoh ohoh
ohohohoh ohoh
ohohohoh ohoh
ohohohoh ohoh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohohohoh ohoh
hear controversy bells a ringin
ohohohoh ohoh
pizza purists voices singin' in
ohohohoh ohoh
be my mirror reflecting truth
ohohohoh ohoh
my toppings in a flavorful stew booth
ohohohoh ohoh
for some reason I can't explain
ohohohoh ohoh
I know the pizza police won't call
never an honest bite
but that was when I ruled the pie
