[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something true
do you find pineapple on pizza
to be right or wrong
do you think it belongs on a pie

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm appalled
at the thought of pineapple on pizza spraw
ling wide
in the good slices and the bad ones

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
are you still eating pineapple pizza
or have you come to
your senses and kicked it tokuyama

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm appalled
at the thought of pineapple on pizza craw
ling near
in the good slices and the bad ones

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end with disgust I dive
I'll never meet the pine
crash through the surface where it can't survive
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha shallows of bad
taste we won't partake no more low
in the sha shallow of bad
taste we're far from now forbad

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ahah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end with disgust I dive
I'll never meet the pine
crash through the surface where it can't survive
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha shallow of
bad taste we won't partake no more
in the sha shallow of
bad taste we're far from now for
