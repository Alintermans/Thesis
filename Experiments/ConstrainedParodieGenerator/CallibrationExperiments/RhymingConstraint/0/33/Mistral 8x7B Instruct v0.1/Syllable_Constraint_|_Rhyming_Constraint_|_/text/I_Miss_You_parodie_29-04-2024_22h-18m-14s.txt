[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it, I desp

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
please forego
this monster from the deep no
one would condone'tis a sin to add
an abomination to
a slice so fine and dandy
we can live like neil and andy if we want
where pineapple hashemi
and we'll have tears on pizzaand in the
night we'll wish this never starts againwe'll
wish this never starts smell

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I despise it I desp
I despise it I desp

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is it and I'm so sorry
it's on my pizza tonighti need san
ity and always this sick sweet
taste comes creeping on
so nauseating every timeand as
I stare I counted the bits
of pineapple disgusting
on my pizza stealing joy like a
thief in the night will you come home
and scrape this mess awaystop
this pain tonight don't waste your time on
my pizza tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your time on me you're already
the taste inside my mouth
I despise it I desp
don't add your time on me you're already
the taste inside my mouth
I despise it I desp
