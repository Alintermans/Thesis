[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie in the oven baking liv
in a kitchen where the flavors are making
a culinary delight that's oh so divine
but then they added pineapple and itching

[Verse 2]
a fruit that doesn't belong on
a savory dish that's oh so
wrong it's like putting ketchup on
a gourmet meal it's just not right ight

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t match they clash and they crash
like a car hitting a wall it
s a flavor
disaster it's not worth the cal
ories it's a crime against

[Verse 3]
paying customers who want
the best they deserve a treat
not a pizza that's ruined by a
fruit that's sweet it

[Verse 4]
some will order it and
regret it some will take a
bite and spit it out it's just
not worth the money it's a crime to

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t match they clash and they crash
like a car hitting a wall it
s a flavor
disaster it's not worth the cal
ories it's a crime against

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin
in the power of good
taste don't let
pineapple oncogen
your taste
buds don't stop
believin holdren
on to the flavor that
matters don't
