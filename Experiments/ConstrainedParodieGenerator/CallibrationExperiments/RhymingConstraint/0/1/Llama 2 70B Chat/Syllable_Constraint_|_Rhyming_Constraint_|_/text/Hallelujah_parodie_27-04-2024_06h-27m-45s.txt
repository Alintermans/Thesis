[Verse 1]
now I've heard that some folks think it's fine
to put pineapple on aol
but I don't really care for their opinion
it's just not right no matter how
you slice it up or serve it with

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah

[Verse 2]
your taste buds may be confused but mine
are not so easily fooled ya
the sweetness of the fruit just doesn't belong
it's like putting ketchup on a
taco or mustard onondaga
it's just not right no matter how you slice it

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 3]
you say I'm just a hater and
I don't understand the cra

[Chorus]
hallelujah hallelujah
pineapple on pizzitola

[Verse 4]

I'll stand before the lord of food
with nothing on my tongue but the truth hallell

pineapple on paniagua
hallelujah hacienda
pineapple on pachysandra
hallelujah hilaria

[Outro]
hallelujah hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been around the
block a few times before I knew
you and I've seen your flag on the marble arch
love is not a victory march it's a
cold and it's a broken hilke
there was a time you let me know what's really go

ing on below but now you ne
ver show it to me doggedly
and remember when I moved in you the hol
y dove was moving too and evry
breath we drew was hallelujah
maybe there's a god above but all I've ever

[Additional Lyrics]
learned from love was how to shoot
at someone who outdrew you and
it's not a cry that you hear at night it's not
somebody who's seen the light it's a cold
and it's a broken hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah pineapple on
