[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain It I
wish it didn't make me

[Verse 1]
give me a slice of pepperoni or a calzone
I'll take it to go or have
it delivered to my home
but don't you dare give me
a pineapple all alone oh
when you said it was akao
I knew you were mistaken
you'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
and now my taste buds are aching soho
don't say it's not fair you clearly weren't aware that pineiro
makes me miserable so
if you really want to know
how I feel about pineapple on a pizza oh
it's just not right it's just not right

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain it I wish it didn't
make me so unhappy so unhappy so unhappy sover
I'm happier than ever

[Verse 2]
you call me up and say you're at the
store and you're buying a pizza for
us but when you show up it's a hawaiian
and I'm just staring at theology
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
cause you don't understand the
simple things that make mehdi

[Verse 3]
and I don't go around telling people how you ru
ined pizza for me with your hawai
ian toppings but that's just embarrassing cause
it's something that you did and I'm still getting
over it so don't try to make me
feel bad about it just leave melee
alone and don't waste the time that I don't have and don
't bring up all the times that you tried to make it right cause
there's no point in bringing up the past we're done so just leave
me alone yeah just leave me alone yeah sa

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
you always said you were misunder
stood but really you just didn
't listen to me at all at all at all
just
fuckin
le
a ve
me a
