[Verse 1]
do you find pineapple quite que
on your pizza pie distasteful find it hard to swallow
do you ever get that feeling of dece
it's not a treat to bite and che
do you ever get that pineapple creep
slipping on your pizza like a grease slick sheet oh no
how many slices have you got
that are ruined with
pineapple chunks that leave you distraught and hot with regret and
disgust at every bite you take and chew and

[Pre-Chorus]
should I give it a go if it's a no from you
will it still be a no tomorrow too baby let
me know if you think it's true that pineapple doesn
t belong on pizza it's a fact we all should know

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to pine
ever thought of declinin
it every
time I always
do maybe it
sours your taste bud
sensations too much to bear
now I've thought it through
crawlin' back to pine

[Verse 2]
so do you got the nerve
to admit that pineapple's got no place
on a savory dish that should be reserved
for cheese and tomato sauce and herbs and spice instead it
ruins every bite with its sweetness in disguise but we
could still enjoy our pizza if you'd just agree
to banish pineapple from your life forcibly

[Pre-Chorus]
should I give it a go if it's a no from you
will it still be a no tomorrow too baby let
me know if you think it's true that pineapple doesn
t belong on pizza it's a fact we all should know

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to pine if you ever thought
of changin' your mind baby
let me know if you think it
sours your pizza too much to bear
now I've thought it through crawlin' back to pine
outro lyrical repeat of
should I give it a go if
it's a no from you
will it still be a

[Outro]
no tomorrow too baby let me know if you
think it's true that pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza it's a fact we all should know do I want
to know if you want me crawlin' back toquepala
do you want me crawlin' back to pineapple on a
pizza do you want me crawlin' back to pineapple
on a pizza do you want me crawlin' back to pineap
