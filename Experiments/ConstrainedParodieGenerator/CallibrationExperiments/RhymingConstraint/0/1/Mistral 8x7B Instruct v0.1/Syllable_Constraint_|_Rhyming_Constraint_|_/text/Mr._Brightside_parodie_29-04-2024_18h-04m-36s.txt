[Verse]
emerging from my denial and I've been doing
fine without that taste I've been declininguh u
stuck in my ways and I've been refusingthat slice so bland
it started with a bite but now I understand
it's a travesty to put pineapple on a
pizza base it's just a waste of space and taste it
clashes with the sauce and makes my stomach churnin
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're still defending it
I'll never comprehend
let me go
and I just can't stomach it again
it's driving me round

[Chorus]
jealousy of those who enjoy itin
their own deluded waydrown
in their own sick rational
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is calling me
to open up my eager
eyes and see the truth

[Guitar Solo]
