[Verse 1]
I took a bite of that pie with pineapple
my taste buds screamed in dismay and shock somehow
the slimy fruit mixed with cheese and tomato
I spit it out and now I'm telling you how

[Verse 2]
oh that sweet and savory combination fell flat
like a bad joke at a party you can't
take back the taste still lingers in my mouth like a
bad dream that I can't seem to forget or

[Pre-Chorus]
shake off the thought of pineap
please just leave it off my plate
I'll be okay but I'm not in a good state now
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
cause there it is again that slimy slice of
pizza topped with fruit it's not so nice I'd rather not recol
lect it all too well but there
it is again that pineapple

[Verse 3]
the can of pineapple chunks near the pepperoni jar
it's a temptation I try to ignore but it's always there staring
at me from the fridge shelf I resist the urge to add it to
my pizza but I know it's not meant to be a part
of the dish I'd rather have olives or mushrooms instead of
that sweet and tangy taste that just doesn't belong
on a pizza oh why did someone even think of
putting pineapple on a pizza in the first place it
was a mistake that I can't
forgive or forget it all too well but there
it is again that pineap
please just leave it off my plate I can't take it all too
well but there it is again that pineapple on a

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza it's a crime I can
t forgive it's not meant to be
on a pizza please just leave it off the
menu I can't take itstee

[Chorus]
cause there it is again that slimy slice of hell
pizza topped with fruit it's not so nice I'd rather not recol
lect it all too well but
there it is again that pineap
please just leave it off my plate I can't take it all
too well but there it is again that pineapple on a
pizza it's ahranat
e it's not meant to be on a slice

[Bridge]
maybe I'm just too traditional when
it comes to pizza but pine
apple just doesn't belong on a slice
of pizza it's a
mistake that I can't
forgive or forget it all too
well but there it is again that pineapple on a pizza
it's a shame that some people can't see the error of their
ways but I can't let it go I remember
it all too well but there it is
