[Intro]
is it a crime to put pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once I had a pie that was
sweet and savory delightful
but then you put pinetta
on top of my dream

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later oh
you still can't get it right oh no oh no oh no oh no
you dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
you search in every topping's bed for somethin' greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when I laid down on the box
was it over when you added the pepper
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
uh huh uh huh uh hu

[Verse 2]
when you put ham on top of
my cheese and sauce oh no
red onion and bell pepper
you ruined the whole thing

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
the way you put the
pineapple on top of my dream
oh no oh no oh no oh
you should be ashamed of yourself oh

in your dream as you passed out baby
