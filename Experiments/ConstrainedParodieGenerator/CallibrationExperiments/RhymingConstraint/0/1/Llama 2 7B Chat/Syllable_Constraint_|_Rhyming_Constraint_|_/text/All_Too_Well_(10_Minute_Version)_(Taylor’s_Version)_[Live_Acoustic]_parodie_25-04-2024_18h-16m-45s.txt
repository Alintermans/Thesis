[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
it's like a sin to put it on a pie that
ought to be plain and fine instead of a flav
disaster that it is pineapple does not

[Verse 2]
belong on a pizza it's like a joke that's not fun
it's like a lie that's been told for too long and
now the truth is coming out pineapple does not
go on a pizza it's like arakelian

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's wrong and we
ought to be ashamed of what
we've done but we're not and that's the worst part of it
pineapple

[Chorus]
because pineapple does not belong on a
pizza and we all know it's true and if we keep pretending
it's okay then we're just as
guilty as those who put it there

[Verse 3]
the toppings are simple and plain and they should stay that way
don't let the pineapple ruin the flavor of the pinochet
it's like a sin to put it on a pie that's meant to be sav
devoured in one bite but the pineapple makes it
last forever and a day and that's just not right pawtucket
pineapple does not belong on a pizza and
we should all agree on that and move on with our
lives without the pineapple in our faces and the
guilt of knowing we're eating wrong
pineapple does not belong on a pizza
it's like a crime against cul
humanity and we should all rise up and demand change
because pineapple does not belong onondaga

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's wrong and we
ought to be ashamed of what we
done but we're not and that's the worst part of
pineapple does notestine

[Chorus]
because pineapple does not belong on a izz
pizza and we all know it's true and if we keep pretenses
it's okay then we're just
as guilty as those who put it
there we are again on that little town street with the
pineapple on the pizza and we're singing in the car
getting lost upstate with
the wind in our hair and the sun

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
till you tore it all
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
because I remember it all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you double cross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you but
you keep my old scarf from that very
first week cause it reminds you of innoc
ence and it smells like
me you can't get rid of it cause you rem
ember it all too well yeah we were there again
when pineapple did not belong on a pizza and we all knew
it was rare I was there down the stairs you were there too we

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like
me you can't get rid of
it cause you remember it all too

[Chorus]
because pineapple does not belong on
a pizza and we all know it's true and if we keep
pretending it's okay
then we're just as guilty as those
who put it there we were there
again on that little
town street with the pistole
on the pictorial
getting lost upstate with
the wind in our hair and the

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your lovers stay my age
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bon
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
just between us did the love affair maim you too
cause in this city's barren
cold I still remember the first fall of
snow and how it glistened as it
fell I remember it all too

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well yeah we were there
again when pineapple did not belong
on a pizza and we all knew it
it was rare I was there down the steps
you were there too we were there again when pe
pineapple did not belong on a a
pizza and we all knew it was rare
I was there down the stairs you were there
too we were there again when pe
pineapple did not belong on a a
pizza and we all knew it was rare
