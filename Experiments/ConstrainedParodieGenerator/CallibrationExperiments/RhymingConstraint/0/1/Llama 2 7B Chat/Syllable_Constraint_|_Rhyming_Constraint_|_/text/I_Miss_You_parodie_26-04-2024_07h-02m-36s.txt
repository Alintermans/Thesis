the flavor that doesn't belong on a
the dissonance in the to
the fruit that doesn't belong

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on a

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
the flavor that doesn't
don't waste your time on
I miss pineapple on a pizzitola
I miss pigmentation
I miss pineapple on
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
the flavor that doesn't
don't waste your time on
I hope you enjoyed this parody of the
blink eleven song with
a twist to it that is

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
