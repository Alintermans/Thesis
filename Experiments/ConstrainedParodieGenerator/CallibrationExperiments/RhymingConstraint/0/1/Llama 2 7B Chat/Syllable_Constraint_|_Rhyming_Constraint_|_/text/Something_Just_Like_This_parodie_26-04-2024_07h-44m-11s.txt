kiss I want something just
like this doo doo doo doo do

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just
like this doo doo do
do doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like this
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just
like this doo doo doo doo dobis
do doo doo doo doo dobis

she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk I

kiss I want something just
