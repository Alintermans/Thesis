[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
pineapple just isn't

[Verse 1]
give it a try before you judge so harshly dear friend
to taste a new blend of flav
on our savory bread
do you read my recipes
or do you skip my recipe
when you said you'd try italy
was our pizza even
on your menu that day I knew when I asked you
to be open to my suggestion you
would add pineapple instead of bacon or ham or salomone
and I'd end up more confound
don't say it's not profound
you clearly weren't aware that you made me feel down
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza pie is
right we're happier than ever pineapple just isn
t on our pizza pie right wish we could explain it better
we wish it wasn't true pine

[Verse 2]
you call us back with a slice in hand
topped with sweet and tangy pineapple
we cringe and shake our heads in dismay and
waste our breath defending our taste
we don't relate to you
we don't relate to you no
'cause we'd never top our pizza
this way you made us hate this

[Verse 3]
and we don't post our opinions online bitter
never shared our thoughts on pineapple
'cause that's just embarrassing it was our all time
favorite dish and all that you did wasil
make it a disappointment so we shut
it all out for you because weasel
kids but now we've learned our lesson well and won't let you
ruin our pizza pie again with pineapple
never paid attention to our dietary needs
so we shut out our friends forfeitable

[Outro]
you ruined our perfect
pairing always said you were unique
made our pizza your own
just leave us alone pineapple no more
ah
goddam
ah
leave us
alone
