[Verse 1]
just a small town cook with an unusual dish
pineapple on a pizza causing quite a
a city palate with a taste so bold and free
pineapple on a pizza ruvalcaba

[Verse 2]
a chef in a crowded kitchen
the aroma of debate and
for a bite they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
waiting in the line so long
their opinions searching in the
pizza parlor
living just to find delight in
the toppings hidden inky

[Verse 3]
struggling to create a
everybody wants aka
paying any price for a slice of
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some will savor it with
some will hate it through and through
oh the debate never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
waiting in the line so long
their opinions searching in the
pizza parlor
living just to find delight in
the toppings hidden inky

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
