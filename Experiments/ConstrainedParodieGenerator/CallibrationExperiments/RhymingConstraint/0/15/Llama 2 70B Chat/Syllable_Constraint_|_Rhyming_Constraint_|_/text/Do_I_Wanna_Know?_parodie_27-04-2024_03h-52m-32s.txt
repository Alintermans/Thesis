[Verse 1]
have you got pineapple on your
pizza that you're eatin' with glee every bite you take
do you ever get that feelin' that it
just don't belong like a fruit
that's not supposed to be savory and
sticks out like a sore thumb like a hawaiian pizza
are there some flavors up your sle
that you're tryin' to
hide from me have you no idea that it's just not right how
many toppings can you combine before it's just

[Pre-Chorus]
too much do I wanna know if this topping flows
both ways sad to see you go was hopin' that you'd stay
baby we both know that pineapple don't go
with cheese in no way shape or form not today pistole

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to bas
ic pizza toppings ever
thought of addin
'em when you're full bra
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too bus
y lovin' pizza the way
it should be to fall
for somethin' new now

[Verse 2]
so have you got the gut
s to take a bite and savor each che
wy bite and if so I wanna know what time
you'll realize it's just not right simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt it's just I'm constantly on the
cusp of tryin' to taste the flavor oflaherty
but I don't know if you feel theology

[Pre-Chorus]
too much do I wanna know if this topping flows
both ways sad to see you go was hopin' that you'd stay
baby we both know that pineapple don't go
with cheese in no way shape or form not today pistole

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to bas ic pizza toppings
ever thought of addin' em
when you're full bra beheadings
I always do maybe I'm too bus
y lovin' pizza the way it should be
to fall for somethin' new now I
've thought it through crawlin' back to
basics baby come
on come on come on

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
sad to see you go was hopin' that you'd stay baby
we both know that pineapple don't go with che
ese in no way shape or form not today pistilli
do you want me crawlin' back to basics pizza to
ppings that are right for me and you and every one
to enjoy the way it's meant to be enjoyed not with fruit
