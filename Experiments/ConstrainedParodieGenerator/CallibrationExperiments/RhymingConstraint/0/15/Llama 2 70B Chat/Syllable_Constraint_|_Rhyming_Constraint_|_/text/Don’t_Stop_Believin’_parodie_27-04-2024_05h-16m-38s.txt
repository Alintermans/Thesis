[Verse 1]
just a pizza pie in the oven baking liv
in a kitchen where the flavors are making
a culinary delight that's oh so divine
but then they added pineapple aven

[Verse 2]
a fruit that's sweet and juicy too
but it don't belong on a
pizza that's just not what to do
it's a sin it's a crime it's a trav

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t belong together they
just don't mix they're like oil and
water they'll just
separate forever and e
ver and e ver egeland

[Verse 3]
pepperoni and sausage
yes they're a great combo bud
dy but add pineapple and it's just
not the same no

[Verse 4]
some like it hot some like
it cold some like it with to
ppings that are bold but pineap
ple on pizza that's just not for me

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings that don
t belong together they
just don't mix they're like oil and
water they'll just
separate forever and e
ver and e ver egeland

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believin
in the power of good
pizza don't
stop believin holden
on to
the feelin' that
pizza should beeferman
don't stop belated
hold on to that
