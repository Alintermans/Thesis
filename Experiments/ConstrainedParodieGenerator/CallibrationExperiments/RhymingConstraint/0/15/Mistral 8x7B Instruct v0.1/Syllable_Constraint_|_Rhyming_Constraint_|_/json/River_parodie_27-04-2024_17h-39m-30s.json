He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is off\nthe truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with pineapple on his plate\nto catch flack sweat jackets and dress\nslacks on his breath he's a mistake he\ndoesn't know that pineapple on pizza is a\nmess it's a chess match he's on his way to digate\nshe's kept track of all his bad food takes and\nguess who just happens to be moving on to the next dish\nactually just shit on that pizza and order fish instead of\nthat abomination on\nhis plate she has what his taste buds lacks but still he insists\non putting pineapple on his pizza and he\njust doesn't get it it's a disgrace so let the river\nrun and wash away that disgust\nfrom your plate and start anew without that pineapple\nabuse so bye bye to that pizza excuse me while I order\nsomething else instead of that disrespectful\nfood on my plate so let the river run\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna do is off\nthe truth and my jokes now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one night stand turned a one bite stand it\nwas come sunlight scram now we hug tight and say good\nbye to that pizza she just wants to exact\nrevenge and get back at that pizza she can\nkeep the crust I don't want it I don't wanton\nthat pizza I don't want it I don't wanton\nthat pizza anymore I don't want it I don't\nwanton that pizza anymore I don't want it I don't wanton\nthat pizza anymore I don't want it I don't wanton that\npizza anymore I don't want it\nI don't wanton that pizza anymore I don\n't want it I don't wanton that pizza anymore I don\n't want it I don't wanton that pizza an\nymore I don't want it I donvan\n't wanton that pizza anymore you\ncan have it I don't wanton that pizza an\nymore I don't wanton that pizza\nanymore I don't\nwant it I don't wanton that pizza an\nymore I don't wanton that pizza anymore I don\n'don\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's pineapple on\nmy plate\ncall\nme pineap\nple on my plate we'll let\nthe river run call me pineapple\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the joker with my words always\nthe hater with my sne always theses\nfood fights left us in a wreck tangled what else can I say\nit was fun for a while but now I'm over it so\nbye bye to that pizza excuse me while\nI order something else and\nlet the river run and wash away that\ndisgust from my plate and start anew without that\npineapple abuse so let the river run\nand wash away that disillusion\nfrom my plate and start anew without that pine\napple abuse so let the river run and\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker with my words\nbeen a hater with my sne\nall my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me\nwell little one\nI donny\n\nwant to admit to something if all it\n's gonna do\n\nis off the truth and my jokes now\nare falling like the rain so let the river run\n",
