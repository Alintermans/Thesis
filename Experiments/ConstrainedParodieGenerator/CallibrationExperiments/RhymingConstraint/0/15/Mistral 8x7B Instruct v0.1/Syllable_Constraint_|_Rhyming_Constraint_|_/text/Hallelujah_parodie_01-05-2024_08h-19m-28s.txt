[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for it do ya pov
it goes like this the dough the sauce
the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the baffled chef adds pineapple to it

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco

[Verse 2]
your taste was fine but you needed proof
you tried it once and it ruined
your trust in pizzas aloof with pineapple
it lay on top like a mistake
too sweet it made your tastebuds a
cry for help as you tasted the pineapple

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco

[Verse 3]
you say it's not a true pizza
I say it's just a different
style but still it's not for you so why bother
there's a blend of taste in every bite
it doesn't matter if it's right
or wrong it's still a broken pizza promise

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco

[Verse 4]
I tried it once it wasn't much
I couldn't taste it so I removed
the pineapple and felt relief in my soul
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the pizza gods
with nothing on my plate but pepperoni

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no noxso
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no no no

[Outro]
pineapple no no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this taste I've had it sore
I used to love pineapple before I knew
and I've seen your flag on the pizza box
love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken pizza promise

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I tried it new
the taste was strange it wasn't true
and every bite we drew was broken pizza

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a taste above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to spit at someone who outdrew you
and it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken pizza promise
