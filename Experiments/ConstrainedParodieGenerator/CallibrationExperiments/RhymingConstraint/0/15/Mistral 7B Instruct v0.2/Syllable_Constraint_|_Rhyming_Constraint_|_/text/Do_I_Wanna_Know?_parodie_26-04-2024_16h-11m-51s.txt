[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clings like something in
the middle of your slice and makes
your taste buds recoil and pine for something
more refined than this tropical combination's scheme
how many palates cancelling
'cause there's this dish I found
that makes me think of food gone wrong an' I serve it on repeat
until I'm full and groan in disbelief at what

[Pre-Chorus]
is this flavor's fate if we both partake in this
unconventional pairing that's hard to take away
we both know that the nights were made for trying new
combinations but this one's a mistake andante

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to cheese
ever thought of ordering
when you've hades
I always do
maybe I'm too
addicted to the
traditional comanches
now I've thought it through
crawlin' back toby

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been pondering if your preference is
still open and if so I wanna know what
topping shuts it down before it's too late for me to ask
calm down and top it up I'm sorry to interrupt this flow
it's just I'm constantly on the edge of trying to
add this ingredient but I donofrio

[Pre-Chorus]
is this flavor's fate if we both partake in this
unconventional pairing that's hard to take away
we both know that the nights were made for trying new
combinations but this one's a mistake andante

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to cheese crawlin' back to cheese
ever thought of ordering
when you've had aphrodite
I always do I always dobies
maybe I'm too busy being loyal
to the classic combinations
to fall for this newbury
now I've thought it through
crawlin' back toby

[Outro]
is this flavor's fate if we both partake in this
unconventional pairing that's hard to take away
we both know that the nights were made for trying new
combinations but this one's a mistake andante
is this flavor's fate too busy being loyal to
fall for this new addition ever thought of calling
is this flavor's fate do you want me crawlin' back to you
