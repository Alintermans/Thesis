[Verse 1]
now I've heard there was a secret fruit
that pizza chefs refused to mute but
you don't really care for taste I presume it
goes like this with syllables in
the sixth and seventh place a pine
the major clash of flavors that's so fine or

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Verse 2]
your palate was strong but you needed
proof from the toppings inverted
her anchovies and jalape√±os over
took you to a culinary
chair they mixed your sauce andreoli
and from your plate they drew the hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Verse 3]
you say I spoke of pineapple
I don't even know the name
but if I did well really what's it to ya
there's a blaze of flavor in every
bite it doesn't matter which you
tried the sweet or the savory halleluj

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Verse 4]
I did my best to make it right
I couldn't taste so I tried to bite
I've told the truth I didn't come to fight ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of cu
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Outro]
hallelujah for pizza pie

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I've been here before
I know this oven I've cooked this
dough and I've seen your pepperoni arch love
is not a victory dish it's a cold
and it's a broken halleluj
hallelujah for pizza pie hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved in you
the holy pepper wasiyu
and every bite we drew was hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a chef above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outcooked
you and it's not a cry that you hear at
night it's not somebody who's seen the
light it's a cold and it's a broken halleluj
