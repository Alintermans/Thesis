[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza controversy and
the truth and my lies now

[Verse 1: Eminem]
it's a food fight in the kitchen heated and
toppings misplaced with no respect
pineapple on a pizza is a
gastronomic debate that we can't neglect
it's a battle of taste buds like aforement
she's got a recipe to change the trend
and I know he's using me to try to blend in his team
'cause she loves tradition and I'm a trendsetter at heart and you know that
but she's devised some plan to
topple the pineapple throne and start a new start with a
fresh tomato sauce and mozzarella delight
knife in hand says our pizza's hangin' by a strand so
she's been on the web lately brows
says maybe she'll be my margherita to spite her
man and I know she's using me to try to play him I don't
care hi suzanne but I shoulda saidiner
after the first slice but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza controversy and
the truth and my lies now

[Verse 2: Eminem]
one slice turned a second slice turned a third
it was come toppings sun set now we hug tight and
he found out now she feels betrayed and used up
'cause he took it off now she's feeling abused and
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that weiand
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and sue
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person toland
so I revert to the kitchen like a hole in the wall diner don
have to be reserved in a booth I just
feel like the person who I'm turning into's irrede
mable I preyed on you like it's a pepperoni deland
and now that I got you I don't wantland
took advantage in my hunger to land
why do I do this act that I land
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
pineapple and cheese is burning the wound
'cause now with her in the pan
we can't bring her in this world shoulda known
to use protection before I bit into your forbidden
food

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause is a
pineapple on a pizza controversy and
the truth and my lies now

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's ooh my name's o
pizza
o
h pizza
ooh river run ono
ooh pizza river run ondaatje

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the topping never the main course
pineapple on a pizza is a cul
inary debate that I'm swerving around in four ways
speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice maybe
that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
but I made you terminate myslinski
this love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unborn child

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker with a pine
been a lover with a twist
all my mistakes need correction time to unwind and align
well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
gonna cause is a pineapple
on a pizza controversy and the truthful
my lies now thespian
