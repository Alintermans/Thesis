[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is a crime scene
can't believe it's not a
disgusting combination of
tastes like a tropical nightmare in my mouth and
I'll never understand the
appeal of putting fruit on

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before but this time it
really takes the cake or should I say pie
we never learn our
mistakes but this one takes the pinkett
we gotta get away from this toka
toka toka tokar

[Chorus]
stop your crying pineapple it's a sign of
the times we gotta get away
from your sweet and sour crime scene
it'll be alright we promise we'll find
a new topping that doesn't make
us want to vomit andante

[Verse 2]
just when we thought it was safe to eat a pie
along comes pineapple and
ruins the whole thing like a
bunch of rotten fruit in my salad bar
can't believe we ever
fell for it inamura

[Pre-Chorus]
we've been here before but this time it
really takes the cake or should I say pie
we never learn our
mistakes but this one takes the pinkett
we gotta get away from this toka
toka toka tokar

[Chorus]
stop your crying pineapple it's a sign of
the times we gotta get away
from your sweet and sour crime scene
it'll be alright we promise we'll find a
new topping that doesn't make us
want to vomit andante we

[Bridge]

your excuses for
this abomination
