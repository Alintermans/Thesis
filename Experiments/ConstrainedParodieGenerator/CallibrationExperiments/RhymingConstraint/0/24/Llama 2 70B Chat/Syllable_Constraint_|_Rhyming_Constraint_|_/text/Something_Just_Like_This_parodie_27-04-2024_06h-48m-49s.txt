[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for
a long time now it's true
I've tried alligator
and chicken too igu
but one topping that
I just can't abide
is pineapple it's just not right it ruins the taste

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no pignataro
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza incomplete
I want something just like pe

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo do oahu
doo doo do donohue
oh I want something just like pe
doo doo do donohue
doo do donohoo
doo doo do donahue
oh I want something just like pe
doo doo do donatelli

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading recipes
of old and new ones too
the legends andretti
and the myths they do too
the pizza toppings they
all say the same thing too
no pineapple it's just not worth the pain it

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you want to go how
much you want to risk I
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no p nicolau
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza incomplete

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like pe
doo doo doo doxology

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like pe
doo doo do donohue
doo do donohoo
doo doo do donahue
oh I want something just like pe
doo doo do donohue
doo do donohoo
doo doo do donahue

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no pignataro
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza incomplete
I want something just piet

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like pe
oh I want something just like pe
oh I want something just like pe
