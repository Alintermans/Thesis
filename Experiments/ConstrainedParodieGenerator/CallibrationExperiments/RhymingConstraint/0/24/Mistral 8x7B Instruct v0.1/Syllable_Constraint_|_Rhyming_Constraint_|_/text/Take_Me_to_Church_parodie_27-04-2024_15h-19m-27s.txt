[Verse 1]
my pizza's got a to
pping that's a no go payload of pine
apple on display it saperstein
to me it's just ahluwalia
if the heavens ever did speak
they'd say leave pineapple
each week it gets more bleak asiaweek
on my pizza cacique
we were born to eat pepperoni
my pizza offers no substit
utes she tells me pineapple doesn
t belong on pizza only ham
and cheese will do allingham
I was born to eat italy
but not with fruit upon

[Pre-Chorus]
a no no
no noverco

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza don't you dare defile it now
I'll tell you my toppings and you can take it out
offer me a savory
oh good god let me keep hereabout
keep pineal
off my pizza don't you dare defile ara
b it's not for you to desecrate how
ever it mayoralty
pizza's meant for cheese and roundabout

[Verse 2]
if I'm a fan of savory to
ppings my pizza's got no
place for fruit it's just not right to
put pineapple on pizza
drain the whole sea to find a better
accompaniment for pizza that
's a fine looking upmarket
topping what you got in the
oven we've got hungry pizza
lovers that's a tavernier
work of art don't

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza don't you dare defile it now
I'll tell you my toppings and you can take it out
offer me a savory
oh good god let me keep how
ever it'll
taste best don't put pineapple on anyhow
pizza's meant for tomato sauce and how
ever it's dressed italy
won't approve of pineapple on

[Bridge]
no pineapple on pizza when the feast begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
in the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
only then I am human only then imogene

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh no no
no overthrow

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off my pizza don't you dare defile it now
I'll tell you my toppings and you can take it out
offer me a savory
oh good god let me keep hereabout
keep pineal
off my pizza don't you dare defile ara
b it's not for you to desecrate how
ever it mayoralty
pizza's meant for cheese and roundabout
