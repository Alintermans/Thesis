[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a
pizza I am blue and mad
wish I could explain it grandad
but truth ishikawa

[Verse 1]
give me a day or two to think it through now surely
there must be something wrongly
with adding fruit to cheese and
do you see my tweets or do
you eat your pizza with no reg
when I asked you to just mpeg
don't add the pineapple
you did it anyway and now I'm pale imreg
unappetizing sight to see longleg
don't say it's just a phase I'm goin' through you clearly didn nutmeg
that pineapple shouldn't be
on a pizza pie at all
it's just not meant to be y'all so if you really want
to know it all too well then le

[Chorus]
when pineapple's on a pizza I am blue and
wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't
true mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mccamant
mm mm mm mm mm mm ah

[Verse 2]
you add the pineapple again it
tastes like sin I'm on the edge of spe
wasting my breath on this debate it's just not
right you're misguided I don careunit
I'd never add pineapple
it's just not done you're ruining
the taste of pizza for me you
should be ashamed oahu

[Verse 3]
and I don't speak ill of pizza online never told
anyone it's just not fine but now you
added pineapple and now it's a crime so don
waste my time I don't have and donohue
try to make me feel bad I could talk bout
every time I ate itochu
without the pineapple but I'd have an empty line because
you added pineapple and now it's just not fine so
leave the pizza alone yeah leave the pizza alone yeah
leave the pizza alone yeah leave mealo

[Outro]
you ruined pizza for me
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments sour
just leave me alone yeah leave me alone
ah
ah ah
ah
aon
