[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple stranglehold
an anomaly in
hawaiI's delight
pizza's bitter pitfall
but I'm not the kind of eater that it fits all right

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a topping
with a tropical twist or
a superhero
a fairytale dish
just something I can turn to
somebody I relish
I want something mctavish

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo do oahu
doo doo do hitherto
oh I want something mctavish
doo doo do mcandrew
doo do mcadoo
doo doo do deleeuw
oh I want something mctavish
doo doo do m cavendish

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the qu
pineapple stranglehold
an anomaly in
pizza's bitter pitfall
but I'm not the kind of
eater that it fits all right again tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go now
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a topping
with a tropical twist or
a superhero
a fairytale dish
just something I can turn to
somebody I relish

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something mctavlish
doo doo do m underbrush

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something mctavish
doo doo do mctavish
doo do mctavish
doo doo do nightmarish
doo doo do mctavish mcclish
doo doo do nightmarish
doo do mccamish
doo doo do horserad

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go
how much you wanna risk
I'm not looking for a topping
with a tropical twist or
a superhero
a fairytale dish
just something I can turn to
somebody I cherish
I want something jellyfish

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something mctavish
doo doo do mctavish mcclish
doo doo do mctavish mcclish
