[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizzas later I see

you search in every vegetarian's pie for something better

to keep my pies out of sight
only rumors about my pepper
and my mischler
oh lord I think about adding
exotic toppings just to
see you come runnin' and say the one
thing I've been wanting but no no no no no

flashin' lights oh lord let
fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later nolette
