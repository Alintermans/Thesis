[Chorus]
when I see pineapple
on a pizza it's a crime
I wish I could explain bernheim
I wish it tattersall

[Verse 1]
give me a slice of pepperoni bernheim thoughtful
to write a song ofarrell
to tell me what to do do
do you read my rhymes do you
when you said you were passing through
was I even on avenue
I knew when I asked you to
be cool about what I was telling ballyho
you'd do the opposite of ballyho
what you said you'd do and I'd end up more afraid afraid donohue
don't say it isn't fair
you clearly weren't aware
that you made me miserable so if you really
wanna know know know know know how

[Chorus]
when I see pineapple on a pizza it's a
crime I wish I could explain bernheim I wish it tat
tersall tat tat tat tat tattersall tat tat tat tat marafat
tat tat tat tat tat tatters

[Verse 2]
you call me again drunk in your ben
driving home under the influence
you scared me to death but I'm wasting my breath
cause you only listen to asean
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
cause I'd never treat me this pit
you made me hate aksamit

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
cause that shit's embarrassing you were my eveyth
ing and all that you did was make me fuckin
sad so don't waste the time I don't
have and don't try to make me feel
bad I could talk about every time that you showed up on
time but I'd have an empty line cause you never did
never paid any mind to my mother or friends so I
shut em all out for you cause I was aided

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin leave me alone yeah fuck you
ah
