[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been eating pizza for
a long time now it's true
I've tried alligator
and chicken too igu
but one topping that
I just can't abide
is pineapple it's just not right it ruins the taste

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
but she said where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no pignataro
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza incomplete
I want something just like pe

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
doo doo doo doo doo do
doo doo oahu
doo doo doo doo haiku
oh I want something just like pe
doo doo doo honeydew
doo doo marylou
doo doo doo mashalu
oh I want something just lippy
I want something just lippi

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the legends and the hits
the pizza decontrol
and the flavors they mix
but one thing that I can
not comprehend is how
people think pineapple belongs on a friend

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you want to go how
much you want to risk I
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no p nicolau
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza incomplete

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I want something just like pe
doo doo doo doxology

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like pe
doo doo doo doxorub
doo doo do bernabe
doo doo do mccaleb
oh I want something just lippy
doo doo doo honey cub
doo doo m jacob
doo doo doo m jacobe

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for something that
I can't even enjoy
no pignataro
no hawaiian treat
just something that tastes good on
my pizza incomplete
I want something just like pe

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like pe
oh I want something just lippy
oh I want something just lippi
