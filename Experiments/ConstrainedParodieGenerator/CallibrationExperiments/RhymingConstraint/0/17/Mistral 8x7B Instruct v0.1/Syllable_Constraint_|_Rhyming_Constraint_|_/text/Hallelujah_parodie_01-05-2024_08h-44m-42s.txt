[Verse 1]
now I've heard of a dish that's quite obsc
a pineapple on a pizza slice
but you don't really care for it do ya pov
it goes like this the dough the sauce
the cheese and ham but then a pause
as the baffled chef adds pineapple to it

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco

[Verse 2]
your taste was fine but you needed proof
you tried it once and shatterproof
your trust in pizza crust was broken in two
it weighed you down and made you sigh
you couldn't eat it and wondered high
if pizza with pineapple was really true

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco

[Verse 3]
you say it's just a trend in vain
it's not the same as pepperon
I don't even know the taste of pine I
swear it's not the same as sweet delightful
cheese and tomato redial
the holy or the broken pineapple pie

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco

[Verse 4]
I tried my best it wasn't much
I couldn't taste it so I gorsuch
I've told the truth I didn't come to fool ya
and even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the god of song
with nothing on my tongue but pineapple song

[Chorus]
pineapple no no no no no
pineapple no no noverco
pineapple no no no pozo
pineapple no no verrastro
pineapple no no verdugo
pineapple no no verduzco
pineapple no no nabisco
pineapple no no nakano
pineapple no no nakao

[Outro]
pineapple no no no no no

I used to eat alone before I knew you
and I've seen your pineapple on the mar
giana arch love is avelar
it's a cold and it's a broken pineapple song

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show it to me do you
and remember when I moved into
the pizza slice theodorou
the holy dove was moving too and every

[Additional Lyrics]
bite we took was pineapple
maybe there's a god above a
but all I've ever learned from love was how to
shoot at someone who outdrew you and it
's not a cry that you hear at night it
's not somebody who's seen the light it's a cold and
