[Verse 1]
put down that pineapple slice with a frown on
it's a sign of the times we
must face this culinary war
you might think it's tasty but it's a flawed notion
it looks absurd on a pie
it's just not right my friend oh

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but still weirton
tempted by the sweetness of theism
on our pizza slic

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
face this culinary callous
we gotta get away from this topping
we gotta get away from this
pizza abomination bust

[Verse 2]
put down that pineapple slice and give it a
rest it's a recipe for
disaster on a pizza
remember the taste will be delightful
when you stick to the classics
and leave out theophila

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but still weirton
tempted by the sweetness of theism
on our pizza slic

[Chorus]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on
it's a sign of the times we must
face this culinary cruel
we gotta get away from this topping now
we gotta get away from this
pizza abomination bust

[Pre-Chorus]
we've tasted before but still we're uns
satisfied and always wanting more from
our pizza slices
we've tasted before but still weirton
tempted by the sweetness of theism
on our pizza slic

[Bridge]
we don't add enough
variety to
our pies and it shows
will we ever learn
we've tasted before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
put down that pineapple slice with a sigh on us
we gotta get away
we got to get away from this mess andante
we got to get away from this mess conaway
we got to get away today
we got to get away today
we got to get away aka
