[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my words now are falling like aco
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with pineapple on his plate
to catch flack sweat jackets and dress
slacks mismatched on his breath's a mistake
he's a mistake and she just wants to dislocate
his trust and leave him in the waste basket ices
are melting on his pizza and he can
taste it he's a disgrace and she just wants to erase it
she's devised a plan to scrape it off his plate and replace it ices
with olives and tomatoes
and he's oblivious to the fact that pineapple's a
no no and she's just trying to save herniate
his taste buds from the disgrace of pineapple on pizza
so she's been on the web lately
says maybe she'll start a petition to get pineap
ple off the menu and he doesn't care he's already had a
slice and he's not going back to anandeep
fries and a burger he's already had

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker with my words
been a hater with my sne
all my jokes need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna do is off
the truth and my words now are falling like aco
so let the river run

in my thirst to pursue why do I do

always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if life was aaa
highway and pineapple was a sin I'd be swerving in
five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin' on ice
maybe that's why I may have came at you
sideways I can't keep these
pineapple lies straight but I made you slice
it up and now it's too late this love triangle
left us In a wreck tangled what else can I
say it was fun for a while bely
I really woulda loved your smile didnt really
wanna abort but fuck it what's one more lie
