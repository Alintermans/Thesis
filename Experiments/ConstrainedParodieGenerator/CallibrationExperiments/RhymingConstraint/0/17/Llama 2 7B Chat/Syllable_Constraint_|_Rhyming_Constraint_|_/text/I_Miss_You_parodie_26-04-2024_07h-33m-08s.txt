[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the topping from my pierre
the sweet and tangy delightful treat that
can't be found on any
other pizza in sight oh
we can live without it if we must try but
it's just not worth the costco
and we'll have pepperoni instead
and we'll wish this topping never ends oh
we'll wish this tostado

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the pineapple going
I can't find it anywhere in sight
I need it on my pizza to
make it taste just right
it's not the same without it oh no oh no
and as I stare at the pie
I count the slices that are
missing from my life oh oh oh oh
will the pineapple come back to
life and make everything right
make everything right tonight oversight
make everything right

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza don't waste your
time on pineapple on
I miss pineapple on a pizzitola
I miss pineapple on
I miss p irelan

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza don't waste your
time on pineapple on
I miss pineapple on a pizzitola
I miss pineapple on
I miss p irelan
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza don't waste your
time on pineapple on
I miss pineapple on a pizzeria
I miss pineapple on
I miss p ireton

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss p irelan
I miss p ireton
