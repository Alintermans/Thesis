[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to crave the taste
of pineapple on my pizza
but now I see the error of the
massive mistake inversely

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to think it was
a tropical twist on a classic
but now I see the truth is
pineapple doesn't belong on aces
it's like trying to put pe
kitten on aesthetically
pleasing pizza topping hierarchy
listen as the toppings sing incessantly

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells a ringin' loud and
clear as the pineapple stanaland
be my mirror my sword and shield
my pizza toppings in a holyfield
for some reason I can't explain
why pineapple shouldn't be
on a pizza that was
never an honest word spoken

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it's a flavor that just doesn't
mix with the savory delight
of cheese and sauce and pepperoni
it's like trying to put a fork in a
blender and expect it to
create a culinary work
of art instead of a messy disaster
revolutionaries wait in the

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells a ringin' loud and
clear as the pineapple stanaland
be my mirror my sword and shield
my pizza toppings in a holyfield
for some reason I can't explain
why pineapple shouldn't be on a pie
never an honest word
spoken in this pineapple fight
