[Verse 1]
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a crime
Don't you know it's a flavor that doesn't rhyme?
It's like puttin' ketchup on a hot dog, it just ain't right
How could you do this to my taste buds tonight?
I'm beggin' you, please don't make it a fight

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this topping flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd say no
(Baby, we both know) That the pizza was mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to pineapple (Crawlin' back to pineapple)
Ever thought of takin' it off? (Takin' it off)
'Cause I always do (I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)
Busy bein' wrong (Bein' wrong)
To fall for a topping new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to pineapple

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your taste buds are still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to eat you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be toppings if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this topping flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd say no
(Baby, we both know) That the pizza was mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to pineapple (Crawlin' back to pineapple)
Ever thought of takin' it off? (Takin' it off)
'Cause I always do (I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)
Busy bein' wrong (Bein' wrong)
To fall for a topping new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to pineapple

[Outro]
(Do I wanna know?) If this topping flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd say no
(Baby, we both know) That the pizza was mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' wrong to fall
(Sad to see you go) Ever thought of takin' it off, darlin'?
(Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to pineapple?
