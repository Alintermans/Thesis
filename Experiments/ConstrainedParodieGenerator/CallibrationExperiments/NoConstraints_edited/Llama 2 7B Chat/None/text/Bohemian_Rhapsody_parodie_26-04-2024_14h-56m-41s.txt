[Verse 1]
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a crime
Can't believe you'd even think of putting it in line
It's like a sin, it's like a shame
How could you ruin such a perfect pie?
Mama, please, don't make me cry
I can't stand the thought of it in the sky
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a lie
Can't believe you'd even think of putting it in line
It's like a sin, it's like a shame
How could you ruin such a perfect pie?
[Chorus]
Any way the pizza rolls, doesn't really matter to me
Any way the cheese melts, doesn't really matter to me
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a crime
Can't believe you'd even think of putting it in line
It's like a sin, it's like a shame
How could you ruin such a perfect pie?
[Verse 2]
Pepperoni and mushroom, that's the way to go
But pineapple, oh no, it's got to go
Can't stand the taste, can't stand the smell
It's like a nightmare, it's like a hell
How could you even think of putting it on a pie?
Mama, please, don't make me cry
I can't stand the thought of it in the sky
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a lie
Can't believe you'd even think of putting it in line
It's like a sin, it's like a shame
How could you ruin such a perfect pie?
[Chorus]
Any way the pizza rolls, doesn't really matter to me
Any way the cheese melts, doesn't really matter to me
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a crime
Can't believe you'd even think of putting it in line
It's like a sin, it's like a shame
How could you ruin such a perfect pie?
[Bridge]
I know you think it's just a pizza, but it's so much more
It's a tradition, it's a culture, it's a score
Don't you know that pineapple doesn't belong?
It's like a sin, it's like a shame
How could you even think of putting it on a pie?
[Chorus]
Any way the pizza rolls, doesn't really matter to me
Any way the cheese melts, doesn't really matter to me
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a crime
Can't believe you'd even think of putting it in line
It's like a sin, it's like a shame
How could you ruin such a perfect pie?
[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Any way the pizza rolls, doesn't really matter to me
Any way the cheese melts, doesn't really matter to me
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a crime
Can't believe you'd even think of putting it in line
It's like a sin, it's like a shame
How could you ruin such a perfect pie?
