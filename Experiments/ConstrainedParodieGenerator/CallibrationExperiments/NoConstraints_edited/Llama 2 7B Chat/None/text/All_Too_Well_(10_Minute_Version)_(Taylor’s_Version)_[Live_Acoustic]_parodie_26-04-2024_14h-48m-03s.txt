[Verse 1]
We walked through the door, the taste was bold
But something 'bout it didn't feel like gold
And I left my hunger there, at the door
And you've still got it in your fridge, oh no!

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet toppings and my craving for more
We're singing in the kitchen, getting hungry for more
Pepperoni and mushroom, they're falling down like rain
And I can picture it after all this pain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's not right
But I can't help myself, I'm drawn to the fight
Pineapple on a pizza, it's a sin
But I'll take it anyway, 'cause I'm a fool for love within

[Chorus]
Pineapple on a pizza, it's a crime
We're eating it anyway, 'cause it's on our mind
Hawaiian delight, it's not what we desire
On a pie, it's just not worth the fire

[Verse 3]
Photo on the table, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a pizza topping, now you're dead
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the bread
You told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was bread
And you were tossing me the pepperoni, "Fuck the sauce"
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's not right
But I can't help myself, I'm drawn to the fight
Pineapple on a pizza, it's a sin
But I'll take it anyway, 'cause I'm a fool for love within

[Chorus]
Pineapple on a pizza, it's a crime
We're eating it anyway, 'cause it's on our mind
Hawaiian delight, it's not what we desire
On a pie, it's just not worth the fire

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in the sauce
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this topping was a masterpiece
'Til you took it all away
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a pie
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of dough lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been toppings, maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was I?
A never-toast, ever-loveliest crust whose shine reflects on you
Not crying in a dumpster, but I'm still here
'Cause I remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
Pineapple on a pizza, it's a crime
We're eating it anyway, 'cause it's on our mind
Hawaiian delight, it's not what we desire
On a pie, it's just not worth the fire

[Outro]
Just between us, did the topping maim you too?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it all too well
