[Verse 1]
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a crime
Don't you know it's wrong, it's like a rhyme
Can't you see it's not right, it's like a sin
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no, it's a crime

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck with this bore
The toppings, the toppings?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck with this bore
The toppings, the toppings?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from this crime
We gotta get away from this crime
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from this crime

[Verse 2]
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the pizza dough
Things look pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck with this topping bore
The toppings, the toppings?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck with this topping bore
The toppings, the toppings?

[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from this crime
We gotta get away from this crime
Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from this crime

[Bridge]
We don't talk enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know

[Outro]
Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
