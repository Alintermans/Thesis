Why Pineapple Should Not Be on a Pizza
[Verse 1]
I used to think it was a treat
But now I know it's a crime
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no it can't be
It's like putting ketchup on a chicken
How could they do this to me?
[Chorus]
Jerusalem bells are ringin'
Pineapple choirs are singin'
Be my pizza, my topping and crust
My taste buds in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Pizza won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when pineapple was banned

[Verse 2]
It was a wicked and wild topping
Blew down the doors to let it grow
Shattered crust and the sound of cheese
People couldn't believe what they'd know
Pineapple lovers wait
For their topping on a silver plate
Just a pizza on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna eat it?

[Chorus]
Jerusalem bells are ringin'
Pineapple choirs are singin'
Be my pizza, my topping and crust
My taste buds in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Pizza won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when pineapple was banned

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
Jerusalem bells are ringin'
Pineapple choirs are singin'
Be my pizza, my topping and crust
My taste buds in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Pizza won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when pineapple was banned

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
