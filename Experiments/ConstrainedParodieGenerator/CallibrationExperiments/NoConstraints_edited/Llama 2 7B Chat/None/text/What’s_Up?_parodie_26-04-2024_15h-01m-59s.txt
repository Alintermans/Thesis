Why Pineapple Should Not Be on a Pizza

[Verse 1]
25 years and my pizza is still
Tryin' to get the toppings just right
For a flavor, mmm
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza in sight
For whatever that means

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I cry sometimes when I'm biting in
Just to get it all out, what's in my mind
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I cook in the kitchen and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"Why is this on a pizza?"

[Chorus]
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, why is this on a pizza?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, why is this on a pizza?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey-ey
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, why is this on a pizza?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, why is this on a pizza?"

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, uh huh

[Outro]
25 years and my pizza is still
Tryin' to get the toppings just right
For a flavor, mmm
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza in sight.
