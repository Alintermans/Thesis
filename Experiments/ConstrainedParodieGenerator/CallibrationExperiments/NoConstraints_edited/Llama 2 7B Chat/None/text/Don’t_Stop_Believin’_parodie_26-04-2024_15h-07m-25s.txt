[Verse 1]
Just a pineapple, livin' on a pizza
In a world of cheese and sauce, it's such a pity
Just a fruit, born and raised in Hawaii
It's on a pizza, goin' anywhere

[Verse 2]
A topping in a heatwave
The smell of sweat and grease
For a bite, they can share the pie
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the crust
Their hunger searchin' in the night
Toppings, people
Livin' just to find a bite
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
Workin' hard to get a slice
Everybody wants a taste
Payin' anything to roll the dough
Just one more time

[Verse 4]
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to be toppings
Oh, the pizza never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the crust
Their hunger searchin' in the night
Toppings, people
Livin' just to find a bite
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Don't stop toppin'
Hold on to that cheese
Toppings, people
Don't stop toppin'
Hold on
Toppings, people
Don't stop toppin'
Hold on to that cheese
