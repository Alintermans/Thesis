[Verse 1]
Now I've heard there was a topping craze
That pineapple brought to the pizza phase
But you don't really care for cheese, do ya?
It goes like this, the margherita, the pepperoni
The baffled pizza lover composing "No pineapple, please"

[Chorus]
No pineapple, no pineapple
No pineapple, no pineapple

[Verse 2]
Your taste buds were strong, but you needed proof
You saw the sauce and it overthrew ya
The cheese and the pepperoni, they broke your heart
And from your lips they drew the "No pineapple, please"

[Chorus]
No pineapple, no pineapple
No pineapple, no pineapple

[Verse 3]
You say I took the toppings in vain
I don't even know the flavor
But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya?
There's a flavor in every bite
It doesn't matter which you choose
The cheesy or the peppery "No pineapple, please"

[Chorus]
No pineapple, no pineapple
No pineapple, no pineapple

[Verse 4]
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't taste, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the pizza lover's throne
With nothing on my tongue but "No pineapple, please"

[Chorus]
No pineapple, no pineapple
No pineapple, no pineapple

[Outro]
No pineapple, no pineapple
No pineapple, no pineapple
