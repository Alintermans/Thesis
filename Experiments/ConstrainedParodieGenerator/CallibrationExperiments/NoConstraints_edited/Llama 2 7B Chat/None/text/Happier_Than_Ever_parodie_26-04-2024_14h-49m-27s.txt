[Verse 1]
Give me a slice, I'll show you why
Pineapple doesn't belong on a pie
It's like putting ketchup on a steak
Or peanut butter on a cake
It just don't make no sense, you see
Can't you see it's plain to me?
[Chorus]
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no
It's a crime, it's gotta go
Can't stand the sweetness, it's a no-go
[Verse 2]
Pepperoni and sausage, that's the way
Mushrooms and olives, they're okay
But pineapple, oh man, it's a disgrace
It's like putting fruit on a pizza, what a waste
Can't you see it's just not right?
[Chorus]
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no
It's a crime, it's gotta go
Can't stand the sweetness, it's a no-go
[Bridge]
I know some folks might think it's cool
But trust me, it's just not the rule
Pizza's supposed to be savory, not sweet
So keep the pineapple off the street
[Chorus]
Pineapple on a pizza, oh no
It's a crime, it's gotta go
Can't stand the sweetness, it's a no-go
