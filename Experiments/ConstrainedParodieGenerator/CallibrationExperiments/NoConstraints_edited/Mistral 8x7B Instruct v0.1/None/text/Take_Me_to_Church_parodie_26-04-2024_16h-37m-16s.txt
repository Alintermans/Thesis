[Verse 1]
My pizza's got a scandal
It's a pineapple, that's final
Everybody's in denial
I should've kicked it to the curb, the trial
If the taste buds ever did speak
It's the last thing they'd seek
A fresh hell each time you eat
It's just wrong, it can't be beat
We were born with standards, you heard 'em say it
My pie offers no delight
She tells me, "Toss it out, it ain't right"
The only taste I'll enjoy
Is when pineapple is let go
Command me to be sane

[Pre-Chorus]
A, no way
No way, no way

[Chorus]
Keep pineapple away
It's got no place on a pizza tray
I'll tell you my taste, you can throw it away
Offer me a savory day
Oh, good God, let me savor my way
Keep pineapple away
It's got no place on a pizza tray
I'll tell you my taste, you can throw it away
Offer me a savory day

[Verse 2]
If I'm a fan of tradition
Pineapple's the abomination
To keep the pizza authentic
It demands a removal
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' tasty
Somethin' cheesy for the main course
That's a fine lookin' slice
What you got in the oven?
We've a lot of starvin' pizza lovers
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Keep pineapple away
It's got no place on a pizza tray
I'll tell you my taste, you can throw it away
Offer me a savory day
Oh, good God, let me savor my way
Keep pineapple away
It's got no place on a pizza tray
I'll tell you my taste, you can throw it away
Offer me a savory day

[Bridge]
No pineapple allowed when the feast begins
There is no sweeter margherita than our simple sin
In the madness and joy of that savory scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, no way
No way, no way

[Chorus]
Keep pineapple away
It's got no place on a pizza tray
I'll tell you my taste, you can throw it away
Offer me a savory day
Oh, good God, let me savor my way
Keep pineapple away
It's got no place on a pizza tray
I'll tell you my taste, you can throw it away
Offer me a savory day
