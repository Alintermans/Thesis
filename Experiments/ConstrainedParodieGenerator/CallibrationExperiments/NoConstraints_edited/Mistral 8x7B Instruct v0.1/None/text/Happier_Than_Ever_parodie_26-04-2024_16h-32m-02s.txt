[Chorus]
When pineapple's on my pizza
I'm less happy than before
Wish I could explain my disgust
I wish it wasn't the law, oh oh

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write a letter to the chef
To tell him what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my pizza reviews?
Or do you skip my words of truth?
When you said you'd top my pie with pine
Was it even on my wishlist?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was orderin'
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up with a frown
Don't say it's just a phase
You clearly weren't aware that you made me cringe
So if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
When pineapple's on my pizza (When pineapple's on my pizza)
I'm less happy than before (Less happy than before)
Wish I could explain my disgust (Wish I could explain my disgust)
I wish it wasn't the law, oh oh

[Verse 2]
You top it again, with ham and pine
Drippin' juice all over the plate
You grossed me out, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you just don't seem to relate
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat my taste buds this shitty
You made me hate this dish

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk shit about it on the web
Never told anyone to give it a whirl
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, it was my everything
And all that you did was make me want to hurl
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you got it right
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my preferences, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)
