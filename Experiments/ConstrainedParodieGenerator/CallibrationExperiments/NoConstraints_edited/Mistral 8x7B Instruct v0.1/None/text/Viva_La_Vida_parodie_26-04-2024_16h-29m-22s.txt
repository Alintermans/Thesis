[Verse 1: Parody Chris Martin]
I used to love my pizza whole
Pineapple was never in control
Now in the morning, I take a bite
Only to find it's not quite right

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: Parody Chris Martin]
I used to top it with delight
Cheese and pepperoni, a tasty sight
But now I've tasted the forbidden fruit
Pineapple on pizza, it's time to refute

One bite, I spit it out
Oh, the horror, I shout and shout
And I discovered that my slice
Lost its flavor, lost its spice

[Chorus: Parody Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disapproval ringing
Neighbors shouting, "Don't you know anything?"
Be my judge, my jury, and my guide
My pizza purists, take me for a ride
For some reason, I can't explain
Once I tried it, there was never
Never a taste so vile
And that was when pineapple was on my pizza

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3: Parody Chris Martin]
It was a wicked and wild sin
Brought the pineapple in, let it begin
Shattered taste buds and the sound of screams
People couldn't believe what I'd done, it seems

Revolutionaries wait
For my apology, they can't wait
Just a victim of a silly trend (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna defend?

[Chorus: Parody Chris Martin]
I hear the bells of disapproval ringing
Neighbors shouting, "Don't you know anything?"
Be my judge, my jury, and my guide
My pizza purists, take me for a ride
For some reason, I can't explain
I know the food gods won't pardon my shame
Never a taste so vile
But that was when pineapple was on my pizza

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
(
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
)
Hear the bells of disapproval ringing
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Neighbors shouting, "Don't you know anything?"
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Be my judge, my jury, and my guide
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
My pizza purists, take me for a ride
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
For some reason, I can't explain
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
I know the food gods won't pardon my shame
Never a taste so vile
But that was when pineapple was on my pizza

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
