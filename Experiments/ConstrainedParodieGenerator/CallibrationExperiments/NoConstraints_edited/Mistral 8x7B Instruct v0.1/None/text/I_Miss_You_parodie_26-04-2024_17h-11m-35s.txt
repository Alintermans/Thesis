[Intro: Parody Singer]
I dislike it, I dislike it

[Verse 1: Parody Singer]
Hello, there
The thorn in my side, a nightmare
The taste that just doesn't belong
The unsuspecting topping
On pizza, a tragedy
We can't live like lions and tigers if we want
Where pineapple should never roam
And we'll have takeout on Friday
And in the night, we'll wish this never spreads
We'll wish this never spreads

[Interlude: Parody Singer]
I dislike it, I dislike it
I dislike it, I dislike it

[Verse 2: Parody Singer]
Where is it? And I'm so sorry
I cannot eat, I cannot stomach tonight
I need something else, not this
This sick, strange monstrosity
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The tears from all the haters
Complaining and ranting, hating their lives
Like indecision to call for a new slice
And hear your defense of treason
Will you change your mind and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Parody Singer]
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
A mistake on my plate (
I dislike it, I dislike it
)
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
A mistake on my plate (
I dislike it, I dislike it
)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Parody Singer]
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
A mistake on my plate (
I dislike it, I dislike it
)
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
A mistake on my plate (
I dislike it, I dislike it
)
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
A mistake on my plate (
I dislike it, I dislike it
)
Don't waste your time on pineapple, it's already
A mistake on my plate (
I dislike it, I dislike it
)

[Outro: Parody Singer]
I dislike it, I dislike it
I dislike it, I dislike it
I dislike it, I dislike it
I dislike it, I dislike it.
