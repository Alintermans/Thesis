[Verse 1]
I took a bite, convinced it'd be a treat,
But something 'bout it just ain't right, you see.
Anchovies, mushrooms, and pepperoni's neat,
But pineapple on pizza's a travesty.

[Verse 2]
The sweet and savory clash, it's such a shame,
The tangy fruit just doesn't belong.
I'd rather have a slice without the blame,
This monstrosity just can't be wrong.

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's not for me,
But still, I'll give it a try.
And I might be okay, but I'm not satisfied at all,
Oh, oh, oh.

[Chorus]
'Cause there it sits, a mess on my plate,
I try to scrape it off, it just won't abate.
The taste in my mouth, I was there,
I remember it all too well.

[Verse 3]
The sticky syrup oozes, it's a pitiful sight,
I'm cringing at the thought, it's just not right.
The crunch of pineapple in every bite,
Oh, how I wish I'd never had this fight.

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's not for me,
But still, I'll give it a try.
And I might be okay, but I'm not satisfied at all,
Oh, oh, oh.

[Chorus]
'Cause there it sits, a mess on my plate,
I try to scrape it off, it just won't abate.
The taste in my mouth, I was there,
I remember it all too well.

[Bridge]
Well, maybe I'm just too old-fashioned,
But pizza's sacred, don't you see?
This sweet and savory mix just can't be right,
It's a sacrilege, a monstrosity.

[Verse 4]
I'll stick to classics, simple and true,
Margherita, pepperoni, or veggie too.
But pineapple, I'm sorry, it just won't do,
I'll pass on this trend, I bid adieu.

[Chorus]
'Cause there it sits, a mess on my plate,
I try to scrape it off, it just won't abate.
The taste in my mouth, I was there,
I remember it all too well.

[Verse 5]
I'll take my pizza straight, no twist,
No fruity additions, just pure bliss.
I'll keep my old ways, I won't insist,
Pineapple on pizza just doesn't exist.

[Chorus]
'Cause there it sits, a mess on my plate,
I try to scrape it off, it just won't abate.
The taste in my mouth, I was there,
I remember it all too well.

[Outro]
Just between us, I can't abide,
Pineapple on pizza, it's a lie.
Just between us, I remember it,
I remember it all too well.

[Spoken Outro]
I love you guys so much, but not the pineapple on pizza.
