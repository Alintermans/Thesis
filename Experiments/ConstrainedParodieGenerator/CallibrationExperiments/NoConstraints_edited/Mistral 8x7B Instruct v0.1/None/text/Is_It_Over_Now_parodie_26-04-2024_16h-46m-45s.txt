[Intro]
(Should it? Should it? Should it? Should it? Should it?)

[Verse 1]
When pineapple's on pizza shown (Uh-huh)
With the taste of ham and cheese (Uh-huh)
Your stomach turns and groans (Uh-huh)
You still can't believe.

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred slices later (Uh-huh)
You see the slice, you cringe, you can't take another (Uh-huh)
You dream of pineapple's sweetness, but it's a lying traitor (Uh-huh)
You search for savory toppings, something greater, baby.

[Chorus]
Was it wrong when it first touched the dough? (Uh-huh)
Was it wrong when it met the marinara? (Uh-huh)
"Stay away," you whispered to the chef (Uh-huh)
In your mind as you passed by, baby (Uh-huh)
Was it wrong then? And is it wrong now? (Uh-huh)

[Post-Chorus]
(Should it? Should it? Should it?)

[Verse 2]
When the pizza hits the table (Uh-huh)
With pineapple on display (Uh-huh)
You push it far away (Uh-huh)
It's not the pizza of the day.

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't notice? (Uh-huh)
The look on your face (Uh-huh)
At least I had the decency (Uh-huh)
To keep my pineapple off your plate (Uh-huh)
Only rumors 'bout my love for fruit (Uh-huh)
And my whispered sighs (Uh-huh)
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin' (Uh-huh)
Off of very tall buildings (Uh-huh)
Just to see you come runnin' (Uh-huh)
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no (Uh-huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward bites later (Uh-huh)
If it's got pineapple, I will surmise that you'll probably hate her (Uh-huh)
You dream of savory toppings before it called you a lying traitor (Uh-huh)
You search for plain cheese, something greater, baby (Uh-huh)

[Chorus]
Was it wrong when it first touched the dough? (Uh-huh)
Was it wrong when it met the marinara? (Uh-huh)
"Stay away," you whispered to the chef (Uh-huh)
In your mind as you passed by, baby (Uh-huh)
Was it wrong then? And is it wrong now? (Uh-huh)

[Post-Chorus]
(Should it? Should it? Should it?)

[Bridge]
Think I didn't notice? (Uh-huh)
The look on your face (Uh-huh)
At least I had the decency (Uh-huh)
To keep my pineapple off your plate (Uh-huh)
Only rumors 'bout my love for fruit (Uh-huh)
And my whispered sighs (Uh-huh)
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin' (Uh-huh)
Off of very tall buildings (Uh-huh)
Just to see you come runnin' (Uh-huh)
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no (Uh-huh)

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizzas later (Uh-huh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there (Uh-huh)
And say the one thing (Uh-huh)
I've been wanting (Uh-huh)
But no (Uh-huh)
(Should it? Should it? Should it? Should it? Should it? Should it?)
