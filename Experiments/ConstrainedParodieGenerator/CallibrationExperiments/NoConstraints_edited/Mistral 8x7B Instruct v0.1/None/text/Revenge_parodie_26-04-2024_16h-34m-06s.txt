[Intro]
I think I, I think I finally
Found a way to justify
Putting pineapple on pizza, such a faux pas
I think that's the first step, right?
You agree?

[Verse]
I've topped two pies for us, my friend
Can't pretend that it's gourmet, ruining the trend
Oh, man, what a dish, the things I hear
If I could act on my cravings, no, would I?
Some burn, some boil, some ruin the taste
And you'd have thought that I would never disgrace
A classic pie, but no, I added pine
And I don't wanna take it off, so in my belly, it'll bide
I've topped two pies for us, my friend
Can't pretend that it's gourmet, ruining the trend
Oh, man, what a dish, the things I hear
If I could act on my cravings, no, would I?
Some burn, some boil, some ruin the taste
And you'd have thought that I would never disgrace
A classic pie, but no, I added pine
And I don't wanna take it off, so in my belly, it'll bide

[Chorus]
In my belly, it'll bide
In my belly, it'll bide
In my belly, it'll bide-ide-ide
In my belly, it'll bide
In my belly, it'll bide-ide-ide
In my belly, it'll bide

[Outro]
In my belly, it'll bide
It'll bide, it'll bide, it'll bide
Is my taste your abomination?
Is all of my taste your abomination?
Enjoy!
