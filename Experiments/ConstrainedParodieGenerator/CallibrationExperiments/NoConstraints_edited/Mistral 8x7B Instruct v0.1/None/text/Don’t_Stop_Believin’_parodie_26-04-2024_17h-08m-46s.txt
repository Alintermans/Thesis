[Verse 1]
Just a small-town pie, in a cheesy bake
A slice so wrong, it's hard to take
Just a classic dish, with fruit out of place
A monstrosity, ruining the taste

[Verse 2]
A topping in a greasy diner
The sight of pineapple, a sininer
For a bite, they can't erase
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Haters waitin'
Down the foodie lane
Their comments searchin' online
Pizza lovers, cringing in disdain

[Verse 3]
Cooking hard to get it right
Everyone's a food critique
Paying anything to try the slice
Just one more bite

[Verse 4]
Some will like, some will dislike
Some are born to eat the hype
Oh, the debate's never done
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Haters waitin'
Down the foodie lane
Their comments searchin' online
Pizza lovers, cringing in disdain

[Chorus]
Don't stop hatin'
Keep on critiquing
Pizza lovers, don't stop hatin'
Keep on critiquing
Pizza lovers, don't stop hatin'
Keep on critiquing
Pizza lovers, don't stop hatin'.
