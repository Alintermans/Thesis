[Verse 1]
Have you got pineapple on your slice?
Do you ever get that thought that ruins the taste of life?
That sits there like a ticking time bomb, you can't ignore it twice
Are there some toppings up your list?
Have you no idea of the disservice you've just missed?
I've cringed every time I saw you take a bite of that abyss
How many taste buds can you dismiss?
'Cause there's this truth I found
That makes me think of you somehow and I shake my fist
At the thought of you ruining pizza, oh the audacity of this.

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this mistake flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was hopin' you'd change your ways
(Baby, we both know) That the pizza was mainly made
For savory toppings, not the sweet of pineapple days

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of orderin' right?
When you're in a group?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too kind
To let this slide
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your taste buds are still open
And if so, I wanna know what time they shut
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to stop you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could enjoy pizza if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this mistake flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was hopin' that you'd change your ways
(Baby, we both know) That the pizza was mainly made
For savory toppings, not the sweet of pineapple days

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of orderin' right? (Orderin' right)
When you're in a group? (In a group)
'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too kind)
Kind to let this slide (Let this slide)
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Outro]
(Do I wanna know?) If this mistake flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was hopin' that you'd change your ways
(Baby, we both know) That the pizza was mainly made
For savory toppings, not the sweet of pineapple days
(Do I wanna know?) Too kind to let this slide, to fall
(Sad to see you go) Ever thought of orderin' right, darlin'?
(Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to you?
