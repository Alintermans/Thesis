[Verse 1]
Put down that pineapple, it's a culinary crime
Taste of pizza's sacred show
Don't you dare defile
That saucy, cheesy, savory style
It's a disgrace, don't you see?
It's not meant to be

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've tried it before
Why add pineapple, it's a travesty for
The pizza, the pizza?
We never learn, we've tried it before
Why add pineapple, it's a travesty for
The pizza, the pizza?

[Chorus]
Put down that pineapple, it's a culinary crime
We gotta save the pizza's soul
We gotta save the pizza's soul
Put down that pineapple, it's ruining the whole
We gotta save the pizza's heart
We gotta save the pizza's heart

[Verse 2]
Put down that pineapple, let's make it right
Taste the margherita's glory
Savor every bite
Melted cheese and tangy tomatoes' delight
Meet again in pizza heaven, out of sight

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've tried it before
Why add pineapple, it's a culinary folly for
The pizza, the pizza?
We never learn, we've tried it before
Why add pineapple, it's a culinary folly for
The pizza, the pizza?

[Chorus]
Put down that pineapple, it's a culinary crime
We gotta save the pizza's soul
We gotta save the pizza's soul
Put down that pineapple, it's ruining the whole
We gotta save the pizza's heart
We gotta save the pizza's heart

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've tried it before
Why add pineapple, it's a culinary folly for
The pizza, the pizza?
We never learn, we've tried it before
Why add pineapple, it's a culinary folly for
The pizza, the pizza?

[Bridge]
We don't discuss enough
Pizza's sacred stuff
Before it's all too rough
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know

[Outro]
Put down that pineapple, it's a culinary crime
We gotta save the pizza's soul
We got to save the pizza's soul
We got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
