[Intro]
Is this a food crime? Is this just a fad?
Caught in a trendslide, no escape from this bad
Open your eyes, look up to the pies and see
I'm just a poor chef, I need no bad rep
Because I'm easy to cook, easy to bake, little high, little low
Any way the oven blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Papa, just killed a pizza
Put pineapple on it, now it's a disaster
Papa, pizza had just begun
But now I've gone and ruined the fun
Papa, ooh, didn't mean to make you sigh
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Bake on, bake on as if nothing's the matter

[Verse 2]
Too late, the pizza's done
Sends shivers down my spine, taste buds are aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Papa, ooh (Any way the oven blows)
I don't wanna eat
I sometimes wish I'd never seen pineapple on my plate at all

[Verse 3]
I see a little slice of a sin
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro abominable
But I'm just a poor chef, nobody loves me
He's just a poor chef from a poor family
Spare the pizza from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil fruit put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can top me and add pineapple to my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to fry?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
[Outro]
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the oven blows.
