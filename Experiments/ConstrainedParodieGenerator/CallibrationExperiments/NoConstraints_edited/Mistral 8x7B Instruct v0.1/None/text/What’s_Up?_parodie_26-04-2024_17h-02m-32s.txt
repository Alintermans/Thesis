[Verse 1]
25 years, and I've yet to find
A single slice with pineapple that's kind
On my taste buds, it's a sin
I try to enjoy it, but I just can't win

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I sigh sometimes, when I see it there
On a pizza pie, it just isn't fair
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I take a slice, and I taste it quick
And I spit it out, and I say with a flick
"What's going on?"

[Chorus]
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh
[Verse 2]
And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try to avoid it, every time
In this pizzeria
And I pray
Oh my God, do I pray
I pray they'll see the light one day
And take it off their menu

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I sigh sometimes, when I see it there
On a pizza pie, it just isn't fair
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I take a slice, and I taste it quick
And I spit it out, and I say with a flick
"What's going on?"

[Chorus]
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey-ey
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh

[Outro]
25 years, and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination, mmm
