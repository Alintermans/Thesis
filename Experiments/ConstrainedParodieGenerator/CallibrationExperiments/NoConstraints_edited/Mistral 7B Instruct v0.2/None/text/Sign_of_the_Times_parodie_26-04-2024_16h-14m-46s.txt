[Verse 1]
Just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times,
Pineapple on pizza, a culinary crime.
Welcome to the final bite,
I hope you're not wearing your best spice,
You can't bribe my taste, on your way to the high,
You look pretty bad, but it's not really pie.

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before,
Why are we always stuck and ordering more,
The pineapple, the pineapple?
We never learn, we've been here before,
Why are we always stuck and ordering more,
The pineapple, the pineapple?

[Chorus]
Just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times,
We gotta get away from this dish,
We gotta get away from this dish,
Just stop your whining, it'll be alright,
They told me that the end is near,
We gotta get away from this dish

[Verse 2]
Just stop your whining, have the taste of your life,
Rising above the savory strife,
Things look pretty good from here,
Remember everything will be right,
We can meet again somewhere,
Somewhere far away from this pie.

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before,
Why are we always stuck and ordering more,
The pineapple, the pineapple?
We never learn, we've been here before,
Why are we always stuck and ordering more,
The pineapple, the pineapple?

[Chorus]
Just stop your whining, it's a sign of the times,
We gotta get away from this dish,
We gotta get away from this dish,
Stop your whining, baby, it'll be alright,
They told me that the end is near,
We gotta get away from this dish

[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before,
Why are we always stuck and ordering more,
The pineapple, the pineapple?
We never learn, we've been here before,
Why are we always stuck and ordering more,
The pineapple, the pineapple?

[Bridge]
We don't talk enough,
We should open up,
Before it's all too rough,
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before,
It's just what we know,

[Outro]
Stop your whining, baby, it's a sign of the times,
We gotta get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away.
