[Intro]
Is this a pizza paradise? Or just a silly farce?
Topped with pineapple, no escape from this disgrace
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a pizza lover, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy eat, easy peel, little sweet, little sour
Any way the toppings go, doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Papa, just spoiled a dish
Plopped a pineapple on, ruined it all with a dish
Papa, pizza had just begun
But now I've gone and changed it all away
Papa, ooh, didn't mean to make you sigh
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my taste has come
Sends shivers down my spine, palate's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Papa, ooh (Any way the toppings go)
I don't wanna pine
I sometimes wish I'd never tasted pineapple at all
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little slice of a dish
Pineapple, pineapple, will you ruin my feast?
Thunderbolt and sweetness, very, very confusing me
(Pepperoni) Pepperoni, (Pepperoni) Pepperoni, Pepperoni gourmet
But I'm just a pizza lover, nobody savors me
He's just a pizza lover from a pepper-loving family
Spare him his taste from this monstrosity
Easy eat, easy peel, will you let me peel?
Bismolla! No, we will not let you peel
(Let him peel) Bismolla! We will not let you peel
(Let him peel) Bismolla! We will not let you peel
(Let me peel) Will not let you peel
(Let me peel) Will not let you peel
(Never, never, never, never let me peel) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me peel
Bacteria has a spoilage put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can top me and smother me with cheese?
So you think you can love me and leave me to please?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
[Outro]
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the toppings go
