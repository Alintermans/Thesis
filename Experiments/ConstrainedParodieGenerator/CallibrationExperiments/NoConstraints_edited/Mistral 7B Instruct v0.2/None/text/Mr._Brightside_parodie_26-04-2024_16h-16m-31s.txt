[Verse]
Comin' out of my fridge, pineapple's been my bane
Gotta, gotta be sane 'cause I hate it on the plane
It started out so sweet, how did it end up on my pie?
(It was just a topping) It was just a topping lie
Now I'm gaggin' in my seat and they're orderin' more
While he's savourin' every bite and she's askin' for more
Now they're diggin' in and my taste buds are in strife
And it's all in my life

[Pre-Chorus]
But she's savourin' his slice now
He takes another bite now
Let me go
'Cause I just can't look, it's drivin' me wild
And takin' control

[Chorus]
Pineapple, turnin' palates into the tide
Swimmin' through savoury lullabies
Chokin' on your lies
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is callin' me
Open up my eager taste
'Cause I'm Mr. Disappointed
[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
I never, I never, I never, I never
I never wanted pineapple on my pizza
I never, I never, I never, I never
I never wanted pineapple on my pizza.
