[Intro]
Come on, Pineapple, we wanna say goodnight to you

[Verse 1]
Holdin' us back
Pineapple on a pizza's holdin' us back
We want you to hold out the palm of your slice
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to taste
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be erased
And we're the ones who will abstain, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
Answer the call
"Pineapple, you're no good on a wall
Why are you stuck in a dish all alone?
What kind of sauce are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your pepper lives by itself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Bridge]
Go home, get fresh, no pineapple on top
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave the pie, two veggies follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

[Outro]
(Hey)
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was [As it was, as it was]
