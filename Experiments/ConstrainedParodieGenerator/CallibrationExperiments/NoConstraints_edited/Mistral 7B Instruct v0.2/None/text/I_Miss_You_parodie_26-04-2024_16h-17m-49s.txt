[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine, I pine

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello, there, my friend
The fruit on my pizza, an unwelcome trend
The topping in the kitchen, causing such a fuss
Pineapple on a pie, it's just not right, it's true
We can live like cheese and tomato if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have peace at the table
But in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine, I pine
I pine, I pine

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where's the harmony, and I'm so sorry
I cannot taste, I cannot savor tonight
I need some balance, and always
This sweet, strange intrusion
Comes creeping on, so disrupting every bite
And as I chew, I pondered
The clash of flavors, so conflicting
Savory and sweet, it's such a fight
And as I taste, I'm haunted
By the memory of pineapple's treason
Will you remove it and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Don't add your fruit to me, it's already
The flavor inside my head (
I pine, I pine
)
Don't add your fruit to me, it's already
The flavor inside my head (
I pine, I pine
)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
Don't add your fruit to me, it's already
The flavor inside my head (
I pine, I pine
)
Don't add your fruit to me, it's already
The flavor inside my head (
I pine, I pine
)
Don't add your fruit to me, it's already
The flavor inside my head (
I pine, I pine
)
Don't add your fruit to me, it's already
The flavor inside my head (
I pine, I pine
)

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine, I pine
I pine, I pine
I pine, I pine
I pine, I pine
