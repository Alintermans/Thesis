[Verse 1]
My lover's got a quirk,
She insists pineapple's the perk,
On a pizza, it's a work,
I should've spoken up before the smirk.
If the foodies ever did decree,
Pineapple's the last true decree,
Every slice's gettin' more bleak,
A new topping each week.
We were born picky, you heard them say it,
My kitchen offers no absolutes,
She tells me, "Top it in the kitchen,"
The only taste I'll be sent to,
Is when I'm alone with you,
I was born picky, but I love it,
Command me to be open-minded.

[Pre-Chorus]
A, amen,
Amen, amen.

[Chorus]
Take me to the kitchen,
I'll top like a dog at the shrine of your whim,
I'll tell you my dislikes, and you can sharpen your knife,
Offer me that deathless death,
Oh, good cook, let me give you my life,
Take me to the kitchen,
I'll top like a dog at the shrine of your whim,
I'll tell you my dislikes, and you can sharpen your knife,
Offer me that deathless death,
Oh, good cook, let me give you my life.

[Verse 2]
If I'm a purist of the palate,
My lover's the pineapple gate,
To keep the gourmet on my side,
She demands a debate,
Peel the whole world, get somethin' spicy,
Somethin' sweet for the main course,
That's a fine lookin' high pie,
What you got in the oven?
We've a lot of starvin' foodies,
That looks tasty, that looks plenty,
This is hungry work.

[Chorus]
Take me to the kitchen,
I'll top like a dog at the shrine of your whim,
I'll tell you my dislikes, and you can sharpen your knife,
Offer me my deathless death,
Oh, good cook, let me give you my life,
Take me to the kitchen,
I'll top like a dog at the shrine of your whim,
I'll tell you my dislikes, and you can sharpen your knife,
Offer me my deathless death,
Oh, good cook, let me give you my life.

[Bridge]
No chefs or kings when the ritual begins,
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle din,
In the madness and oil of that sad culinary scene,
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean.

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, amen,
Amen, amen.

[Chorus]
Take me to the kitchen,
I'll top like a dog at the shrine of your whim,
I'll tell you my dislikes, and you can sharpen your knife,
Offer me my deathless death,
Oh, good cook, let me give you my life,
Take me to the kitchen,
I'll top like a dog at the shrine of your whim,
I'll tell you my dislikes, and you can sharpen your knife,
Offer me my deathless death,
Oh, good cook, let me give you my life.
