[Chorus]
When pineapple's not on top
I savor each savory pop
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't a cop

[Verse 1]
Give me a slice or two to ponder something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to serve, mm-mm
Do you read my recipes?
Or do you skip my gourmet spree?
When you said you were cravin' me
Was I even on your plate?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was suggestin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more averse
Don't say it's a verse
You clearly weren't aware that you made me curse
So if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
When pineapple's not on top (When pineapple's not on top)
I'm savorier than ever (Savorier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't a cop, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
You call me again, drunk on your binge
Binging on pizza under the influence
You spoiled me to death, but I'm wastin' my length
'Cause you only taste like your friends
I don't blend with you
I don't blend with you, no
'Cause I'd never taste this badly
You made me hate this cuisine

[Verse 3]
And I don't gossip about you on the foodie scene
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that's tasteless, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me feel sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty slice 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my palate or kin, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

[Outro]
You ruined every dish I loved
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my flavors your own
Just leave me alone, yeah (Leave you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Leave you)
(Leave you)
