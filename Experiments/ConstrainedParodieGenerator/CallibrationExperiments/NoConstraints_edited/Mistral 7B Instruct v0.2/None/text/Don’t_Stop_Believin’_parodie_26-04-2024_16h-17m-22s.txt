[Verse 1]
Just a small-town guy, livin' in a silly world
He found a pineapple on his pizza pie
A city vegan, born and raised in the land of cheese
She served him up a dish that brought him to his knees

[Verse 2]
A chef in a bustling kitchen
The heat of the oven, a pungent stink
For a taste, they can share the strife
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Diners debating
Up and down the avenue
Their palates searching for delight
Pizza pies, people
Livin' just to find a taste
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
Cooking up a culinary crime
Everybody hates a pineapple prime
Paying any price to roll the dice
Just once more time

[Verse 4]
Some will savor, some will cringe
Some are born to sing the pineapple blues
Oh, the foodie war never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Diners debating
Up and down the avenue
Their palates searching for delight
Pizza pies, people
Livin' just to find a taste
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that disbelievin'
Pizza pies, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Pizza pies, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that disbelievin'
Pizza pies, people
