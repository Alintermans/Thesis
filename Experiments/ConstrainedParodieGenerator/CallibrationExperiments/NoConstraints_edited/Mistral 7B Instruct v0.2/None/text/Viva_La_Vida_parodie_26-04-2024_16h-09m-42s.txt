[Verse 1: AI]
I used to rule the pie
Seas of cheese would rise when I gave the try
Now in the kitchen, I'm all alone
Sweep the counters, I used to own

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: AI]
I used to roll the dough
Feel the shock when pineapple stole the show
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old chef is dethroned, long live the pineapple king"
One minute, I held the cheese
Next, the toppings were closed on me
And I discovered that my pizzas stand
Upon crusts of dough and crusts of shame

[Chorus: AI]
I hear the disapproval bells a-ringin'
Pizza purists choirs are singin'
Be my critic, my foe and scold
My toppings in a foreign fold
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never a savory word
And that was when I ruled the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3: AI]
It was a wicked and wild pineapple wind
Blew down the doors to let it in
Shattered toppings and the sound of groans
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Pizza revolutionaries wait
For my slice on a silver plate
Just a topping on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be the chef?

[Chorus: AI]
I hear the disapproval bells a-ringin'
Pizza purists choirs are singin'
Be my critic, my foe and scold
My toppings in a foreign fold
For some reason, I can't explain
I know the pizza police won't call my name
Never a savory word
But that was when I ruled the pie

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
(
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
)
Hear the disapproval bells a-ringin'
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Pizza purists choirs are singin'
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Be my critic, my foe and scold
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
My toppings in a foreign fold
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
For some reason, I can't explain
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
I know the pizza police won't call my name
Never a savory word
But that was when I ruled the pie

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
