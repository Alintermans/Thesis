[Verse 1]
Load up on pizzas, bring your mates,
It's fun to argue and debate,
Pineapple on top is such a hate,
Oh no, I know a food that's misplaced.

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low,
Hello, hello, hello, how low,
Hello, hello, hello, how low,
Hello, hello, hello,

[Chorus]
With the toppings out, it's less tasty,
Here we are now, let's be silly,
I feel weird and contagious,
Here we are now, let's be silly,
A pineapple, a mystery,
A veggie, my appetite's history.

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yay,

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I like best,
And for this choice, I feel blessed,
Our group's tradition has always been,
And always will until the end,

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low,
Hello, hello, hello, how low,
Hello, hello, hello, how low,
Hello, hello, hello,

[Chorus]
With the toppings out, it's less tasty,
Here we are now, let's be silly,
I feel weird and contagious,
Here we are now, let's be silly,
A pineapple, a mystery,
A veggie, my appetite's history.

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yay,

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And I forget just why I taste,
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me frown,
I found it hard, it's hard to find,
Oh well, whatever, never mind,

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low,
Hello, hello, hello, how low,
Hello, hello, hello, how low,
Hello, hello, hello,

[Chorus]
With the toppings out, it's less tasty,
Here we are now, let's be silly,
I feel weird and contagious,
Here we are now, let's be silly,
A pineapple, a mystery,
A veggie, my appetite's history.

[Outro]
A denial, a denial,
A denial, a denial,
A denial, a denial,
A denial, a denial.
