[Verse 1: You]
Tell me something, friend,
Is your heart content with this culinary trend?
Or do you need more?
Pineapple on pizza, is it worth the sore?

[Refrain: You]
I'm pining
In all the good bites, I find myself whining
For change
And, in the bad slices, I fear the taste

[Verse 2: Food Critic]
Tell me something, pal,
Aren't you tired of this debated call?
Or do you need more?
Pineapple on pizza, is it worth the toll?

[Refrain: Food Critic]
I'm pining
In all the good bites, I find myself whining
For change
And, in the bad slices, I fear the taste

[Chorus: You & Food Critic]
We're off the savory deep end, watch as we dive in
We'll never meet the ground
Crash through the toppings where they can't hurt us
We're far from the pepperoni now

[Post-Chorus: You & Food Critic]
In the sha-taste, sha-hallow
In the sha-taste, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-taste, sha-hallow
We're far from the pepperoni now

[Bridge: You]
Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh-ah, ha

[Chorus: You & Food Critic]
We're off the deep end, watch as we dive in
We'll never meet the ground
Crash through the toppings where they can't hurt us
We're far from the pepperoni now

[Post-Chorus: You & Food Critic]
In the sha-taste, tasteless
In the sha-taste, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-taste, tasteless
We're far from the pepperoni now
