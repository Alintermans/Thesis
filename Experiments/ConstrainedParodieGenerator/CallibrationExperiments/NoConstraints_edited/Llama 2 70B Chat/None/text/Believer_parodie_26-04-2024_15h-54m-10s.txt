[Verse 1]
First things first, let's get this straight
Pineapple on pizza, it's a crime
It's a travesty, a culinary hate
Ruining a classic, it's just not right

[Verse 2]
Second things second, don't you know
Pineapple doesn't belong, let it go
It's a fruit that's sweet, not meant to be
On a pie that's savory, it's just not me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a purist, a traditionalist too
I don't want my pizza with a fruity hue
Give me pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and cheese
But pineapple, no way, that's just not the way it should be

[Chorus]
Pizza! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pizza! You break me down, you build me up
Believer, believer
Pizza! Oh, let the toppings fly, oh, let them rain
My taste, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pizza! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

[Verse 3]
Third things third, it's time to speak
Pineapple on pizza, it's just not unique
It's a trend that's played, a flavor that's weak
Give me something better, something that's me

[Verse 4]
Last things last, let's make it clear
Pineapple on pizza, it's just not here
It's a crime against humanity, a culinary sin
Give me a break, and let the pizza win

[Pre-Chorus]
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

[Chorus]
Pizza! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pizza! You break me down, you build me up
Believer, believer
Pizza! Oh, let the toppings fly, oh, let them rain
My taste, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pizza! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
