[Verse 1]
I've been eating pizza for years
The toppings and the cheese
But one thing that I can't abide
Is pineapple on my pie, it's just not right
It's like a sin, a culinary crime
A fruit that doesn't belong, it's just not fine

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "What do you want on your pizza?
How much heat can you take?"
I'm not looking for something weird
Some topping that's just for show
I want something classic, something real
Something that's truly divine

[Chorus]
I want something just like this
A pizza that's simple, yet so fine
No pineapple, no frills, just cheese
And sauce, that's all I need, that's my plea

[Verse 2]
I've been to Hawaii, I've seen the sun
I've tasted pineapple, it's not for everyone
It's too sweet, it's too sour
It doesn't belong on my pizza, that's for sure
It's like a crime, a culinary offense
A fruit that doesn't make sense, it's just not right

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Where d'you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?"
I'm not looking for something strange
Some topping that's just for show
I want something classic, something real
Something that's truly divine

[Chorus]
I want something just like this
A pizza that's simple, yet so fine
No pineapple, no frills, just cheese
And sauce, that's all I need, that's my plea

[Bridge]
Oh, I want something just like this
A pizza that's plain, yet so nice
No pineapple, no frills, just cheese
And sauce, that's all I need, that's my advice

[Pre-Chorus]
Where d'you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for something strange
Some topping that's just for show
I want something classic, something real
Something that's truly divine

[Chorus]
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
A pizza that's simple, yet so fine
No pineapple, no frills, just cheese
And sauce, that's all I need, that's my plea
