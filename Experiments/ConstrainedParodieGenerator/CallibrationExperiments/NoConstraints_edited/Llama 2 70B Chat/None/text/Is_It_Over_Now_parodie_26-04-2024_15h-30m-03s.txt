[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the pizza was served (Uh-huh)
With the toppings of my choice (Uh-huh)
I took a bite and was scarred (Uh-huh)
You added pineapple, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later
I see your pie and your smile on unsuspecting diners
You dream of my taste buds before they called you a fool
You search in every pizza joint for somethin' cool, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when you put pineapple on my pizza?
Was it over when you ruined my meal?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you added ham (Uh-huh)
And pineapple on top (Uh-huh)
I thought you'd lost control (Uh-huh)
My stomach turned, my taste buds cried

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my disgust out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hunger and cravings
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall pizza stands
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wantin', but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward pizza dates later (Oh)
If it's got pineapple, I will surmise that you'll probably hate it (Oh, no)
You dream of my taste buds before they called you a fool (Oh)
You search in every pizza joint for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when you put pineapple on my pizza?
Was it over when you ruined my meal?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my disgust out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hunger and cravings
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall pizza stands
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wantin', but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizzas later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hopin' you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wantin' (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
