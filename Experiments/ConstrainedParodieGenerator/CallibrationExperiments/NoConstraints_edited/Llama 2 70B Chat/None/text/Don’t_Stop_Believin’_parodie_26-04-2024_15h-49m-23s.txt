[Verse 1]
Just a pizza pie, livin' in a hot oven
Toppings from above, they're never leaven
Pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms too
But pineapple, no, that's just not true

[Verse 2]
A slice of cheese, a crust so fine
The aroma fills the air, it's quite divine
But then they add a topping, oh so strange
Pineapple, no, it's just not right, it's just not strange

[Pre-Chorus]
Pizza lovers waitin'
Up and down the block
Their stomachs grumblin' in the night
Pizza, people
Livin' just to find a bite
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
Workin' hard to make a pie
Toppings piled high, they never die
But pineapple, no, it's just not worth
Ruining a good pizza, that's just not earth

[Verse 4]
Some will love it, some will hate
Pineapple on their pizza, it's a debate
But for those who know, it's just not right
Pineapple, no, it's just not tight

[Pre-Chorus]
Pizza lovers waitin'
Up and down the block
Their stomachs grumblin' in the night
Pizza, people
Livin' just to find a bite
Hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Pizza, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Pizza, people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Pizza, people
