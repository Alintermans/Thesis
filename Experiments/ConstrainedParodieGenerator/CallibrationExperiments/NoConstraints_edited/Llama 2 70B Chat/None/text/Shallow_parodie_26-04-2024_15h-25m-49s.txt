[Verse 1]
Tell me somethin', folks,
Do you think pineapple's where it belongs?
On a pizza, it don't feel right,
It's a fruit that just don't fit the sight.

[Refrain]
I'm fallin' out of love with this trend,
Pineapple on pizza, it's just a fad,
In all the good times, I find myself cringin',
For change, and in the bad times, I'm just sad.

[Verse 2]
Tell me somethin', pizza lovers,
Aren't you tired of this topping disaster?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it time to stop this pineapple monster?

[Refrain]
I'm fallin' out of love with this trend,
Pineapple on pizza, it's just a fad,
In all the good times, I find myself cringin',
For change, and in the bad times, I'm just sad.

[Chorus]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in,
I'll never touch the ground,
Crash through the surface where the pineapple can't be found,
We're far from the shallow now.

[Post-Chorus]
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow,
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low,
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow,
We're far from the shallow now.

[Bridge]
Oh, ha, ah, ha,
Oh-ah, ha,

[Chorus]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in,
I'll never touch the ground,
Crash through the surface where the pineapple can't be found,
We're far from the shallow now.

[Post-Chorus]
In the sha-ha, shallow,
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low,
In the sha-ha, shallow,
We're far from the shallow now.
