[Verse]
Comin' out of my pizza joint, I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a slice, how did it end up like this?
It was only a slice, it was only a slice
Now I'm fallin' asleep and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
But pineapple's on the pizza, it's a crime
It's takin' over the flavor, it's takin' over my mind
Let me go, let me go
'Cause I just can't look, it's killin' me
And takin' control

[Chorus]
Pineapple, turnin' pizzas into a nightmare
Swimmin' through a sea of cheese and despair
Chokin' on the thought of it
But it's just the price I pay
Pizza is callin' me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Pizza Lover
[Guitar Solo]

I'm comin' out of my pizza joint, I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a slice, how did it end up like this?
(It was only a slice) It was only a slice
Now I'm fallin' asleep and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head

But pineapple's on the pizza, it's a crime
It's takin' over the flavor, it's takin' over my mind
Let me go, let me go

I never
