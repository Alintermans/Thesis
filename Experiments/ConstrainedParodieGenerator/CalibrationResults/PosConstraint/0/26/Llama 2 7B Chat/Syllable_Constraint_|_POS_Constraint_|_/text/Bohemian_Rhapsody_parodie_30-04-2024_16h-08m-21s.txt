[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza shouldn't be the
is this just fantasy or reality to me
open your eyes and see the truth so clearly
I'm just a poor boy who can't abide the
because I'm easy come and go with a topping that I don
any way the cheese stretches doesn't really matter to me

[Verse 1]
mama when I order
put a pepperoni on top of my pie and not a
mama life has just begun
but now I've gone and thrown it all away
mama ooh didn't mean to make you sad
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if pineapple doesn't make

[Verse 2]
too late my taste buds have
send shivers down my spine and make my stomach
goodbye everybody I've got to go
gonna leave this topping behind and face the
mama ooh will you let me go this
time I've had enough of
pineapple on a pizza is just too much

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little slice of heavenly pie
olives and pepperoni they catch my eye perfect
thunderbolt and lightning so very frightening me
galileo magnifico pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza galileo figaro will
but I'm just a poor boy who can't abide
he's just a poor boy from a pizza place and
spare him his life from this topping disgra
easy come easy go will you let him go
bismillah no we will not let him go
let him go bismillah we will not let him go
let him go bismillah we will not let him go
let him go bismilla
will not let him go bismilla
mamma mia let him go bismillah mamma
mamma mia let him go
mamma mia let him go bismillah mamma mia let him
mamma mia let him go bismillah mamma mia let him

[Verse 4]
so you think you can top me with pineapple and
so you think you can make me eat my words and
oh baby can't do this to me baby

[Outro]
