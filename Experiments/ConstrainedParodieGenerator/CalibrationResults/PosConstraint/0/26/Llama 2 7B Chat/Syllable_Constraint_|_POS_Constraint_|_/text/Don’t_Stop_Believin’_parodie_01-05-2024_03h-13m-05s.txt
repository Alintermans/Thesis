[Verse 1]
just a pineapple on a pizza town girl liv
she took the midnight train goin' anywhere
just a pizza topping born and raised in hawai
it's a tasty treat goin'

[Verse 2]
a flavor in a slice of che
the smell of sweetness fills the air
for a bite they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers savor
up and down the menu board
their tastebuds searchin' in the
flavor profile
living just to find delightful
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get the right
everybody wants a slice
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more to

[Verse 4]
some will win the pizza
some will lose the topping game
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers savor
up and down the menu board
their tastebuds searchin' in the
flavor profile
living just to find delightful
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop savorin
hold on to that flavor
menu items
don't stop savorin
hold on
menu items
don't stop savorin
hold on to that flavor
menu items
