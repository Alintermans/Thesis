[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
trying to make it taste like paradisea
but it's just not meant to
it's like a crime scenea in disguisea
I can't believe they think it's a good idea
to put something so sweet

[Pre-Chorus]
and I say oh my god oh my god oh my god
what were they thinking when they made this law
pineapple on a pizza is just not the way
it's like a sin to even trya it's just not worth the
time and effort and money they waste on this
fad that's just not gonna lasta no
no no no no

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey he
hey hey he
I said hey hey hey hey hey he
what's going on here it
just doesn't
make any sense to me at all

[Bridge]
oh oh
oh
oh oh oh
oh oh
oh
oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
I know some
people might think it's cool
but they're just not in
the loopa they don't
understand
the horrors of the to
pineapple on a pizza it
just doesn't belong

[Pre-Chorus]
and I say oh my god oh my god oh my god
what were they thinking when they made this law
pineapple on a pizza is just not the way
it's like a sin to even trya it's just not worth the
time and effort and money they waste on this
fad that's just not gonna lasta no
no no no no

[Chorus]
and I say hey hey he

what's going on here it
just doesn't
make any sense to me at all

thinking when they made this lawa it
just doesn't
make any sense to me at all

and money

twenty five years and my life
still trying to get up that great big hill of
hope for a destination
