[Intro]
is it a crime to put pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once upon a time in a
pizza paradise where toppings
were meant to be savored and
not sacrificed for

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later oh
you dream of my crust and cheese in every maiden's
bed for something greater baby oh no oh no oh no oh
you search in every pineapple field for somethin' greater oh

[Chorus]
was it over when he added pineapple
was it over when he added pepperon
I whispered in his ear come here
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
uh huh uh huh uh u

[Verse 2]
when pineapple was born in
a tropical parad
island far far away from
our poor pizza's

[Bridge]
and did you think we didn't notice
there were pineapple
at least we had the decency
to keep our toppings in
only pineapple on our minds
and our pizza
oh lord we think about jumpin
off of very tall pizza
just to see you come runnin
and say the one thing we've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later oh no
you dream of my crust and cheese in every maiden's bed for something great
oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no
you search in every pineapple field for somethin' greater oh

[Chorus]
was it over when he added pineapple
was it over when he added pepperon
I whispered in his ear come here
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it over then and is it over now
