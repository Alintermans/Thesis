[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
it feels so out of sight

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to ponder what's cleverer
to create a recipe
to tell us what to see here
do you read our pizza
or ignore our savory
when you said you'd give it atry
was our pizza even
on your takeout menu we knew when we asked you
to be cool about what we were suggest
you'd add the pineapple despite our request woahohohooho
and we'd end up more confused
don't say it's not amused
you clearly weren't apprised that you made us abused
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now we're happier
our pizza tastes better than ever before wish
we could explain it better we wish it was so true ohohoh
but pineapple ruins the

[Verse 2]
you call us again loaded with your
toppings galore drivin' us crazy
you scared us to death but we
won't waste our breath cause you only
listen to your favorite
we don't relate to you no
'cause we'd never treat our pizza
this way you made us hate this

[Verse 3]
and we don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's just disgusting our pizza was our
everything and all that you did was make us
feel so sad so don't waste our time
and don't try to make us feel bad
we could talk about every time that you arrived on time
but we'd have an empty line because you never did
never paid any mind to our preferences or
our friends so we shut them out for you cause

[Outro]
you ruined our perfect
combination misunderstood made
our pizza moments your
own just leave us alone yeah ohohoh
ah
goddam
ah
leave us
alone
