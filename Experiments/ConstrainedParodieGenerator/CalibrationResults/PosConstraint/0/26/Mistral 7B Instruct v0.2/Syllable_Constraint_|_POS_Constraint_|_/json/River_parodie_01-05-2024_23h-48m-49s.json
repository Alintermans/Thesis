He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar serving a\npineapple on a pizza\nbeen a lover of tradition and a hater of the new\nall my taste buds need cleansing water to rinse away the\nmystery fruit on my pizza\nwell little one I don't want to admit to\nchanging the recipe\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's bringing pineapple home for a taste test\npepperoni and sausage in\ndressings clash and texture's distressed\nbut she insists it's a delicacy to be\nproud of and boasts of her creativity and\npineapple's place in the culinary\nit's a battle of wills in the kitchen so heated up\nshe's got a passion for this pineapple obsession and won't back\nit's a recipe for a\ndisaster in the making and I can't accept that\nit's a flavor clash like a jigsaw puzzle uns\nolved but she's determined to prove me wrong and say that\npineapple's place is here to stay\n'cause she loves novelty and variety and I know\nthat I can't fight with no one's food preference even I know\nbut she's devised some plan to change my mind and\nbake a new dish to try and convince me\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar serving a\npineapple on a pizza\nbeen a lover of tradition and a hater of the new\nall my taste buds need cleansing water to rinse away the\nmystery fruit on my pizza\nwell little one I don't want to admit to\nchanging the recipe\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na simple pizza turned a complex dish\nit was pepperoni and cheese but now it's\ntopped with a tropical surprise and a twist\nhe found out now she's feeling vindicated\nnow how am I supposed to tell this group that we're through\nit's hard to find the words I'm allergic to pineap\nplease don't take it personal I just can't say this\nin person to you so I revert to the kitchen like a hideaway\ndon't have to be reserved in the pantry I just feel like the\nperson who I'm becoming is irrede\nemable I succumbed to the pineapple temptation\nand now that I got you I don't want you to eat it too\ntook advantage in my hunger to consume\nwhy do I do this to myself and to\nyou get on my soapbox and preach of\nmy disdain for this fruit that I consumed and now\nwe can't share this meal together we\ncan't bring our taste\nbuds in agreement shoulda known to avoid\nthe pineapple before I took a bite of your forbidden\ntop\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's ooh my name's o\npizza\no\noh river\nrun our names are o\npizza oh river run our names\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the traditionalist never\nthe one to try the new hey forgive me\nbut pineapple on a pizza it's a trend I can't\nunderstand why can't I say it straight I can'\nt keep my preferences in line but\nI made you compromise your\ntaste buds this pizza love triangle left\nus in a mess tangled what else can I say it\nwas fun for a while but I really woulda\nloved your classic smile did I really\nwant to ruin this dish I didn't really\nwant to disappoint but what's one more lie to\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar serving a\npineapple on a pizza\nbeen a lover of tradition and a hater of the new\nall my taste bud\ns need cle\n\nansing wa ter to rinse away the mis\ntery fruit\n\non my pizza well little one\nI don't want to admit to changing the rec\n",
