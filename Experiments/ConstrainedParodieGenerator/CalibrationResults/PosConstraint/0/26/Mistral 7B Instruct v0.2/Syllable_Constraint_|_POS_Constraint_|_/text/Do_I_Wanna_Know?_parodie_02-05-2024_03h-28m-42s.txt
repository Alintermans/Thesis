[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clings like something in
the middle of your slice where it
should be a savory blend of delight
have you no idea that it's a culinary
nightmare that ruins the taste of
this fine dish that makes
me think of you somehow an' I savor it on repeat till
I take my last bite spillin' sauce on my shirt and

[Pre-Chorus]
is it worth the try if this combination flies
was sorta hopin' for a pizza that would stay the
same but we both know that the nights were made for mix
ing up flavors that you can't enjoy tomorrow

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to pine
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a
pineapple on
'cause I always do
constantly craving
to be that one who's chosen
to fall for a to
pping that's new now I

[Verse 2]
so have you got the
taste buds to try it out and see if
it's a match or if your palate's still got
room for this tropical fruit that's been brought up in debate
calm down and take a bite I'm sorry to
interrupt this conversation but I'm on the edge
of trying to convince you to give it a chance

[Pre-Chorus]
is it worth the try if this combination flies
was sorta hopin' for a pizza that would stay the
same but we both know that the nights were made for mix
ing up flavors that you can't enjoy tomorrow

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to pineapple pie gonna
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a few craving
'cause I always do mixing up the flav
ors to be that one who's chosen to fall
for a topping that's new now that
I've thought it through crawlin' back
to pineapple pie
repeat repeat till

[Outro]
is it worth the try if this combination flies
was sorta hopin' for a pizza that would stay the
same but we both know that the nights were made for mix
ing up flavors that you can't enjoy tomorrow
is it worth the try too busy being true to pine
ever thought of ordering pineapple pie again
is it worth the try do you want me crawlin' back to you
