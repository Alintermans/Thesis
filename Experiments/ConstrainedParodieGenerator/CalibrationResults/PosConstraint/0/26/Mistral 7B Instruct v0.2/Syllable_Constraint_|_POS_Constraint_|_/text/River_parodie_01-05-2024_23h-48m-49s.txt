[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar serving a
pineapple on a pizza
been a lover of tradition and a hater of the new
all my taste buds need cleansing water to rinse away the
mystery fruit on my pizza
well little one I don't want to admit to
changing the recipe

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's bringing pineapple home for a taste test
pepperoni and sausage in
dressings clash and texture's distressed
but she insists it's a delicacy to be
proud of and boasts of her creativity and
pineapple's place in the culinary
it's a battle of wills in the kitchen so heated up
she's got a passion for this pineapple obsession and won't back
it's a recipe for a
disaster in the making and I can't accept that
it's a flavor clash like a jigsaw puzzle uns
olved but she's determined to prove me wrong and say that
pineapple's place is here to stay
'cause she loves novelty and variety and I know
that I can't fight with no one's food preference even I know
but she's devised some plan to change my mind and
bake a new dish to try and convince me

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar serving a
pineapple on a pizza
been a lover of tradition and a hater of the new
all my taste buds need cleansing water to rinse away the
mystery fruit on my pizza
well little one I don't want to admit to
changing the recipe

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a simple pizza turned a complex dish
it was pepperoni and cheese but now it's
topped with a tropical surprise and a twist
he found out now she's feeling vindicated
now how am I supposed to tell this group that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm allergic to pineap
please don't take it personal I just can't say this
in person to you so I revert to the kitchen like a hideaway
don't have to be reserved in the pantry I just feel like the
person who I'm becoming is irrede
emable I succumbed to the pineapple temptation
and now that I got you I don't want you to eat it too
took advantage in my hunger to consume
why do I do this to myself and to
you get on my soapbox and preach of
my disdain for this fruit that I consumed and now
we can't share this meal together we
can't bring our taste
buds in agreement shoulda known to avoid
the pineapple before I took a bite of your forbidden
top

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar serving a
pineapple on a pizza
been a lover of tradition and a hater of the new
all my taste buds need cleansing water to rinse away the
mystery fruit on my pizza
well little one I don't want to admit to
changing the recipe

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's ooh my name's o
pizza
o
oh river
run our names are o
pizza oh river run our names

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the traditionalist never
the one to try the new hey forgive me
but pineapple on a pizza it's a trend I can't
understand why can't I say it straight I can'
t keep my preferences in line but
I made you compromise your
taste buds this pizza love triangle left
us in a mess tangled what else can I say it
was fun for a while but I really woulda
loved your classic smile did I really
want to ruin this dish I didn't really
want to disappoint but what's one more lie to

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar serving a
pineapple on a pizza
been a lover of tradition and a hater of the new
all my taste bud

ansing wa ter to rinse away the mis
tery fruit
