[Intro]
come on folks we gotta speak up our mind now

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's flavor's gone wrong
why put it there when it just doesn't belong
it's time to set it right and right
cheese in the way
ruining the taste every
day it's a debate and a
pizza fight oh oh ohonoooooohhhhhhhooooohhho

[Chorus]
in this kitchen it's just
us know it's not the same
in this kitchen it's just
us know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza lovers standing tall
why settle for less when you can have it
all pepperoni or ve
ggie or meat or
even seafood delight oh oh
toppings galore and no more
pineapple's bitter sting oh oh ohonoooo

[Chorus]
in this kitchen it's just
us know it's not the same
in this kitchen it's just
us know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go pineapple free let innovation
flow I don't wanna talk about the way that it
was leave tradition behind and explore
I don't wanna talk about who's ordering it

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was as it was as
it was you know it's not
