And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nmy hatred I confess\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nsorrystate\nthis question before my plate\nan experiment in the market of\nevery new pie menu\nas people whisper all av\nour shared amededated en counter\nnot your welcomed guestlingly\nbut their rejected must addition\nor after all ihavrattendancew\nour desired be\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nwhat shade its my expressed\nits missing your presence\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nhowhere ify who and your will\nmy growing iven icannotforethe\nmy ought order or illy still\nthis eternal aff\nfood has in as comes ightly billersation\nbut since my can our is\nno pepper from any all\nmay choice or go it icesation\nbefore pizza irecomes\nbut has he heat against change\ndoes our ize needtohe or stayfreezed\nwill an love reignonce\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndoleavepennedishovecloseify\na meal inside myself\nyour hated my our\n\ncan ely tasteorandalljusticeably\nan memorywithout\nour missed my our\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nlet elly passiwithout our heartsun\nwhich flavor without us\nwhat delightthatcomes\n\nlet ily chooseandyoucullweghintoatlas\nwhich friendship under us\nits been we our shared\n\nplease note that this parody is not perfect\nthere existserrorsinst\nmy created it it\n\nlettingtingoneditedomeakeify\nany words with yourself\nits done our our\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nour agreedined\nits canned our our\nour ought our us\n",
