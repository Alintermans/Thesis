[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me something pal
is a pineapple on your pizza
really callin' your
palate or just a silly folly

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm shrinking
in all the good bites I find myself ponder
ing change
and in the bad slices I fear a

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something friend
is this pineapple on your pizza trend
or do you need more
a taste sensation that's not so absurd

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm shrinking
in all the good bites I find myself ponder
ing change
and in the bad slices I fear a

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching it collide
I'll never meet the taste
crash through the toppings where they can't
disapprove us we're far from

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pineapple ha
in the sha pineapple la la low
in the sha pineapple ha
we're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha oh
oh ah ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end watching it collide
I'll never meet the taste
crash through the toppings where they can't
disapprove us we're far from

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha pineapple
sha la la la la low pineapple
in the sha pineapple
we're far from the shallow now
