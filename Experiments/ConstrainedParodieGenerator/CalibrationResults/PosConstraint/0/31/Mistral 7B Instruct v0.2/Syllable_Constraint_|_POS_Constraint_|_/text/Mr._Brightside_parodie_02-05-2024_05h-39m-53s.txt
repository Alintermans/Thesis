[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta hide from the sun because I hate pineap
it started out on a pie but now it's on a pizza
what was once a delight now leaves me feelin' diz
now I'm watchin' them eat and my stomach's in
while they're savourin' each bite and I'm
wishin' I'd never let that pineapple begin
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savourin' each bite
he's chewin' with delight
let me go
'cause I just can't look at that pineapple
and takin' control

[Chorus]
jealousy turns good dishes into the
swimmin' through sick pineapple
chokin' on your excuses
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin' me
open up my eager eyes
'cause I'm mr brightside

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine yet
gotta hide from the sun because I hate pineap
it started out on a pie but now it's on a pizza
what was once a delight now leaves me feelin' diz
now I'm watchin' them eat and my stomach's in pain
while they're savourin' each bite and I'm in disdain
and it's all in my head yet I can't refrain
from hating that pineap

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savourin' each bite
he's chewin' with delight
let me go
'cause I just can't look at that pineap
and takin' control

[Chorus]
jealousy turns good dishes into the
swimmin' through sick pineapple
chokin' on your excuses
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin' me
open up my eager eyes
'cause I'm mr brightside

[Guitar Solo]


[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never
