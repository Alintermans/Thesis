[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the fruit on pizza's
the mystery in the kitchen's pantry
the unsuspecting palate
of flavors clashing bitter
we can live like cheese and tomato if we
want no pineapple on top
and we'll have pizzas
in every season's twilight hour
in the night we'll wish this

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is it and I'm so sorry
I cannot eat without this pineapple
I need some balance and always
this sour intrud
comes creeping on with every bite I take
and as I chew I ponder
the juxtaposition of
sweet and savory blending wrongly
like indecision to order
a pizza without the pine
will you come back and make it right tonight
make it right tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside this
pizza's heart of despair
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside this
pizza's heart of despair

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside this
pizza's heart of despair
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside this
pizza's heart of despair
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside this
pizza's heart of despair
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside this
pizza's heart of despair

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
