[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you under the bright
pineapple on the pizza seemed such a fright
but I left my palate pure at your brother
's house and you've still got it in your fridge tonight

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple's sweet disposition and my puzzled
gaze we're arguing in the car about this
topping falling down like a debate in progress
and I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
more but I might be okay if I forget the
pineapple

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red because you were looking at me
pineapple in my slice it
was a surprise but I can't

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter my disbelief turning red
you used to be a gourmet chef with pepperoni in a twin bed
and your mother's warning stories about your past mistakes with
pineapple on the pizza pie they told me about
your culinary past thinking your future was me and you
were tossing me the recipe keys we were skip
ping town and I was thinking on the drive down any
time now you were gonna say it's a perfect match but all
I felt was disappointment and
you held my disappointed frame pineapple
on the pizza pie check the
pulse and come back swearing it's the same after three months in
the grave and then you wondered where It went to as I

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
pineapple light down the
stairs I was there I remember
it all too well pineapple on the pizza pie wind
in my hair I was there I remember it all too well
pineapple on the top
down the stairs I was there I was

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you topped it
running scared I was
there I remember it all too
pineapple pie all too well pineapple on the pizza pie
I remember it all too well pineapple on the pizza
pie down the stairs I was there I was there sacred
promise and we'd swear to never

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you serve me pineapple
you said if we had been more traditional maybe it would have been
better but that made me want
to scream pineapple on the pizza pie that
idea you had of me who was she a never hungry never full
pineapple queen whose shine reflects on
you not weeping in a party bathroom
some critic asking
me what happened you pineapple on the pine
apple pie that's what happened you pineapple on
the pizza pie you who charmed my dad with self deprecating jokes
sipping beer like you're on a late night show but then he watched

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you serve me my old favorite pizza and
I walk home alone but you keep my old pepper
oni slice from that very first week it reminds you
of innocence and it tastes
like me you can't get rid of it

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
pineapple on the pizza
pie wind in my hair you
were there you remember
it all pineapple on
the pizza pie down the
stairs you were there you were there sac

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your toppings stay the same
from when your pepperoni broke my skin
and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half
your weight and did the pineapple bru
ise paint you blue just between us did the love af
fair maim you too pineapple
on the pizza pie and did the pineap
ple love affair leave scars on me
'cause In this city's barren cold I

[Outro]
still remember the first fall of snow and how it glisten
ed as it fell I remember it all too well pine
apple on the pizza pie I remember it all too well pine
apple on the pizza pie I was there
I remember it all too well pine
apple on the pizza pie I was
there I remember it all too well pineap
ple on the pizza pie I was there pine
apple on the pizza pie I was
there I remember it all too well
pineapple on the pizza pie
I remember it all too well pineap
ple on the pizza pie I was there
pineapple on the pizza pie we
were there we were there pineapple
on the pizza pie we were there pineap
ple on the pizza pie we were there
