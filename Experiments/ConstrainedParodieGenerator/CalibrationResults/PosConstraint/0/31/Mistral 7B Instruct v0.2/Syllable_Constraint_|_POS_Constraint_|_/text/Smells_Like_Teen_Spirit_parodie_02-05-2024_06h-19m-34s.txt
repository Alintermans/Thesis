[Verse 1]
load up on pizzas bringing
friends for a culinary bond
pineapple on top is the sinning trend
oh no I know a disgusting

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pie lovers gather near
hello pie lovers gather here
hello pie lovers gather close
hello pie lovers all

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less tasty
here we are now let's
disagree and argue passion
here we are now let's disagree
a pineapple a savory
a mystery my appetite

[Post-Chorus]
yum yum no

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I like best
and for this choice I feel blessed
our little group has always been
and always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pie lovers gather near
hello pie lovers gather here
hello pie lovers gather close
hello pie lovers all

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less tasty
here we are now let's
disagree and argue passion
here we are now let's disagree
a pineapple a savory
a mystery my appetite

[Post-Chorus]
yum yum no

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I taste
oh yeah I guess it makes me shake
I found it hard it's hard to find
oh well whatever let's agree

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pie lovers gather near
hello pie lovers gather here
hello pie lovers gather close
hello pie lovers all

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less tasty
here we are now let's
disagree and argue passion
here we are now let's disagree
a pineapple a savory
a mystery my appetite

[Outro]
a compromise a compromise
a compromise a compromise
a compromise a compromise
a compromise a compromise
a compromise
