[Verse 1]
twenty five years with this strange
tryin' to figure out the great pineapple
on a pizza scene oh
realized quickly when I took a bite and
saw this fruit on top was not part of the plan for me
for whatever that means

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I feel a little peculiar with this to
pping on a pizza pie I step outside and take a
deep breath and I get real low and I shout out
what's going on here nowadays in
the kitchen scene

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
I said hey
what's this pineapple on my pie
heyeyey heyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey
what's this pineapple on my pie

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
and I pine
oh my taste buds
I pine all the time
in this culinary
and I ple
oh my palate do ple
I plead every single day
for no pine

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I feel a little peculiar with this to
pping on a pizza pie I step outside and take a
deep breath and I get real low and I shout out
what's going on here nowadays in
the kitchen scene

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
I said hey

tryin' to get up that great big hill of
hope for a destination
