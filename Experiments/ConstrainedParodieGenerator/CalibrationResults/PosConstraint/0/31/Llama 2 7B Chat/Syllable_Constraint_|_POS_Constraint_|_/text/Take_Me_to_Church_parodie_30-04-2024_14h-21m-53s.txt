[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie
my taste buds can't deny it's a
crime against culinary decree
can't stand the sweetness in the
air it's a sin to combine it
with cheese and pepperon
make me vomit just the thought of it
a pizza without a
topping is like a hug without a
squeeze it's just not the same without
a slice of heavenly bliss without
the tropical twist that makes me miss
it's like a pizza without
a purpose in life without a
bite of joy without a

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no no
no no no no

[Chorus]
take me to the
library instead of pineapple on a pie
I'll worship with my nose in a book and my eyes
on the pages of knowledge
I'll tell you my sins and you can loan
me a novel
offer me a life of learning and growing old
oh good god let me give you my mind instead of
a pizza without a to
pping is like a life without a quest

[Verse 2]
a pizza without a challenge is
like a life without a
purpose it's just not the same with
out a topping that makes me
feel alive and ready to roam it
like a pizza without a sau
a story that needs to be
told it's like a pie without
a crust that's stale and cold it's just
not the same without a topping
that makes me feel bold

[Chorus]
take me to the
library instead of pineapple on a pie
I'll worship with my nose in a book and my eyes
on the pages of knowledge
I'll tell you my sins and you can loan
me a novel
offer me a life of learning and growing old
oh good god let me give you my mind instead of
a pizza without a to
pping is like a life without a quest

[Bridge]
no pineapples on pies when the truth begins to
unravel the secrets of the universe and the lies
that we tell ourselves begin to fade away
in the light of knowledge and the fire of the mind

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no no no
no no no no

[Chorus]
take me to the
library instead of pineapple on a pie
I'll worship with my nose in a book and my eyes
on the pages of knowledge
I'll tell you my sins and you can loan
me a novel
offer me a life of learning and growing old
oh good god let me give you my mind instead of
a pizza without a to
pping is like a life without a quest
