[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza should not be seen ton

[Verse 1]
sweet and juicy
but it doesn't belong on
a savory pie like a dream gone wrong ton
it's just not the same as it was
margherita
and it's not the same as it
wasn't the same as it was
when it was just cheese and sauce and love and

[Chorus]
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
spicy sausage
and pepperoni too but
pineapple doesn't belong in this crew
it's like a party without
the guest list is
incomplete without the cheese and
the sauce and the love and the
pepperoni and the sausage too but not

[Chorus]
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home and get ahead and light speed net
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave pineapple behind and follow the
love and the cheese and the sauce and the pepperoni

[Outro]
he
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
