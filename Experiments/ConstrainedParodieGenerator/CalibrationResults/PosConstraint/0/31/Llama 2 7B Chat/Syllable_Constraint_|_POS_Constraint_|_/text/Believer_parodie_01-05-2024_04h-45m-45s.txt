[Verse 1]
pineapple
oh no don't put that on my pizza
it's a crime against culina
I can't believe you'd even
consider such a topping so

[Verse 2]
secondary to
the cheese and sauce so fine and smoothly blended in
it just doesn't belong
like a sore thumb in a suit so fine
it's just not a good fit you see

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet
of cheese and pepperoni only
never in my wildest dreams
did I see pineapple on a pizza oh no no
never in my wildest dreams oh
no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza oh no
it's a crime against cul
pineapple on a pizza oh no
it's just not right you see
pineapple on a pizza oh no no no
it's a pizza sin oh no no no
no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no

[Verse 3]
thirdly and
forthwith I must protest this abom
pineapple on a pie
it's a travesty a culinary
faux pas a crime against taste bud

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet
of cheese and pepperonionly
never in my wildest dreams oh
no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza oh no
it's a crime against cul
pineapple on a pizza oh no
it's just not right you see
pineapple on a pizza oh no no no
it's a pizza sin oh no no no
no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no

[Verse 4]
lastly and
for the love of cheese and sauce so fine and
blessed be the toppings that bring
together in perfect harm
no pineapple in sight oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet of cheese and pepperon
never in my wildest dreams did I see pineapple on a
pizza oh no

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza oh no
it's a crime against cul
pineapple on a pizza oh no
it's just not right you see
pineapple on a pizza oh no no no
it's a pizza sin oh no no no
no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no
