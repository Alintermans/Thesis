[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the topping from my nightmare
the flavor that doesn't belong on a

the fruit that doesn't belong
on a pizza that's already perfect on
we can have margherita
and barbecue chicken if we want
and we'll have pizza on thanksgiving too
and in the oven we

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the sweetness going to
I cannot taste it without a reason
I need something to complement
this savory pie
and pineapple doesn't do it for me at
all the spices and herbs and
veggies and meats and cheeses
can't mask the flavor of the fruit
it's like a crime to put it on
a pizza that's already
a masterpiece of flavor and texture
will you take it off

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza that's already
perfectly delicious
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza that's already
perfectly delicious

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza that's already
perfectly delicious
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza that's already
perfectly delicious
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza that's already
perfectly delicious
I miss pineapple on a pizza no more
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
