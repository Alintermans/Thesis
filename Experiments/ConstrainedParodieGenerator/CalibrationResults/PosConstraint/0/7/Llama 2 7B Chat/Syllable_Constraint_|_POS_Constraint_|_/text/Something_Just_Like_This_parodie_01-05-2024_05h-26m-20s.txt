[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the recipes and the
ingredients they told
how to make a pineapp
on a pizza and
I'm not buying it no
it's not a superpower or a gift from above

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go and
how much you gotta risk
I'm not looking for something that
tastes like a tropical storm
some superhero
pineapple on a
pizza is not the answer
I want something just like
this pizza without the fruit

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just
like this pizza oh
oh I want something just
like this pizza oh oh oh oh
oh I want something just
like this pizza oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
I want something just like this oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the history of to
ppings and the way they were
supposed to be used and
not on a pizza they
said the wise old man in
the kitchen of my mind and I agreed with

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go and
how much you gotta risk
I'm not looking for something that
tastes like a tropical storm
some superhero
pineapple on a
pizza is not the answer
I want something just like

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like
this pizza oh oh oh oh

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
without the fruit and the
sweetness and the heat
I want something that's sav
y and satisfying and not
something that makes me feel
like I'm in a bad
dream or a nightmare or

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you gotta risk
I'm not looking for something that
tastes like a tropical storm
some superhero
pineapple on a
pizza is not the answer
I want something just like
this pizza without the fruit

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
oh I want something just like this
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
