[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza should not be the crime of
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
it started out as a topping on a pie and now it
how did it end up in this disgrace and it was
only a topping and now it's taking over
it's in the crust and it's in the cheese and it'
now it's on the sausage and it's on the pepper
and it's all over the

[Pre-Chorus]
but the toppings are touchin
they're takin' over the
let me go
'cause I just can't eat it all and it's kill
and takin' control

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza should not be
it's a crime against human
ity turnin' pies into
a fruit salad and it's not
supposed to be this way and
it's all in my head and it
destiny is call

I'm comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
it started out as a topping on a pie and now it

it's in the crust and it's in the cheese and it's in

and it's all over the

[Pre-Chorus]
but the toppings are touchin
they're takin' over the
let me go
