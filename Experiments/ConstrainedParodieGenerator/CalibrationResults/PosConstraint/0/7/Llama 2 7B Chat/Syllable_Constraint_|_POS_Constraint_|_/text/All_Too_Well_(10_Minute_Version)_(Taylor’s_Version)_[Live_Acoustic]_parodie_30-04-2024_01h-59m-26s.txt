[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
it's like they're mocking our taste buds in time
and the cheese don't even complement it
it's like they're trying to sabotage our

[Verse 2]
oh the horror of it all I can't even stand
the sweetness of the pineapple clashes with
the savory of the sauce and the cheese in hand
it's like they're playing a cruel joke on us

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's wrong and we
shouldn't be fighting this fight
but the pineapple pizza is an abomni
ation and

[Chorus]
we'll never be able to unsee the horror
of the pineapple on the pie and the pepperoni too
it's like they're ruining the
sacred tradition of pizza

[Verse 3]
I remember the good old days when pizza was pure and
the toppings were few and the flavors were sure and secure in our
hearts and minds and stomachs but now it's all about the fad and
the trend and the novelty and the pineapple is
leading the charge and it's just not right and it's just not fair and
it's just not pizza and we won't stand for it
no we won't stand for it no we won't stand for
it's just not pizza and we won't stand for it no we
won't stand for it no we won
won't stand for it no we won't stand for
it's just not pizza and we
won't stand for it no we won't stand for it no we
won't stand for it no we won't stand for it no

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's wrong and we
shouldn't be fighting this fight but
the pineapple pizza is an abom
ination and we won't rest

[Chorus]
until it's gone and we're free to be ourselves
and enjoy the pizza the way it was meant to be enjoyed
with the toppings that bring
us joy and happiness and ful
fillment and not this fad that's trying to tear us ap
art and it's just not right and it's just not fair and it's just
not pizza and we won
won't stand for it no we won't
