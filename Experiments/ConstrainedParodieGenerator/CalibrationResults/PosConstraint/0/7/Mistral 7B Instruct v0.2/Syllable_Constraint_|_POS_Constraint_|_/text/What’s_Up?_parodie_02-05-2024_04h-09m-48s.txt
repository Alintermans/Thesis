[Verse 1]
twenty five years with this strange
tryin' to figure out the great pineapple
on a pizza scene oh
realized quickly when I took a bite and
saw this fruit on top was not part of the plan for me
for whatever that means

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I feel a little peculiar with this to
pping pineapple on a pizza just doesn't seem right
and so I wake in the morning and I step
outside and take a deep breath and get
real high and scream

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyeyey heyeyeyey hey
I said hey
what's this pineapple doing here
heyeyeyey heyeyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey
what's this pineapple doing here

oh my god do I pine
I pine all the time
for a pizza without
and I ple

I plead every single day
for a change in the

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head

and so I wake in the morning and I step
outside and take a deep breath and get
real high and scream

with a destination free
