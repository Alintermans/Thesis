[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you under the bright
pineapple on the pizza seemed such a fright
but I left my palate pure at your brother
's house and you've still got it in your fridge tonight

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple's sweet disposition and my puzzled
gaze we're arguing in the car about this
topping falling down like a debate in progress
and I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
more but I might be okay if I forget the
pineapple

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ordered wrong because you were looking at me with
disbelief in your eyes and
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pineapple on the pizza in the kitchen light we're deb
ating the merits of this controversial choice of topping on a
pizza pie and your mother's shaking her head in disappro
val and you told me about your past and your love for
pineapple on pizza and I was thinking about the taste
and how it clashed with the tomato sauce and cheese
and how it ruined the perfect harmony of the
pizza and I was longing for the simpler days of
pizza without pineapple on
'em and then you wondered why it tasted so off
but all I felt was regret
and you held my hand and we both knew it was a mistake
but we couldn't turn back the hands of time and undo

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about the pineapple
long enough to forget why it

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing about the merits of this topping in the
refrigerator light
down the stairs I was there I was
there I remember it all too well pineapple on
the pizza ruining the harmony of the meal and
how it left a bitter
taste in my mouth and how it changed the

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
pineapple on a
pizza ruining the
balance of the flavors running
scared I was there I remember it all too well pineapple
on the pizza ruining the harmony of the meal and
how it left a bitter taste in my mouth and how
it changed the balance of the flav

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you serve me pineapple
on a pizza you said if we had been more open minded maybe
it would have been fine but that
made me want to gag and die the idea
you had of me a pineapple lover who was I a never ending
source of amusement for you and your
friends not weeping in a party bathroom
some critic asking
me what happened you that's what happened
you who charmed my dad with self deprecating jokes
sipping beer like you're on a late night show but then he watched me watch
the pizza being served and he said it's supposed to be

[Verse 5]
time won't fly I'm paralyzed by it I'd like
to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it after
pineapple days and nights when you made me your own now
you serve me plain pizza and I walk home alone
but you keep my old favorite topping from that
very first week because it reminds you of nostalg
ia and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it because

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you ruined the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well pineapple on the top
you remember it all
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapple stays the
same from when your brooklyn broke my taste bud
sensitivity and bones I'm a soldier
who's returning half my appetite
and did the pineapple bruise paint you blue just bet
ween us did the love affair
maim you too because in this city's bar
ren cold I still remember the
first fall of snow and how it melt

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well pineapple on
the pizza ruining the harmony
of the meal and how it left a bit
ter taste in my mouth and how it changed
the balance of the flavors just between us
I remember it all too well pineap
le on the pizza ruining the
harmony of the meal and how it

and how it changed the balance of the flav
ors just between us I remember
