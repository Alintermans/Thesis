[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
a taste that just won't persist

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you argue with me about this trendy
topping on my pizza
I'm the one who orders tradition
my palate's the captain of

[Pre-Chorus]
I was puzzled by the debate
adding pineapple to my plate's
a mystery that I couldn't
solve with just a single debate's shakeup and bakeup
pining for the classics that we
makeup in our hearts as we
cook up a storm in the kitchen
baking our feelings in it

[Chorus]
pineapple's a pain that makes me a
skeptic skeptic skeptic
pineapple's a flavor that drives me
crazy skeptic skeptic
pineapple oh let it be a mistake that
ruins my meal it came from a mis
take pineapple's a pain that makes me
skeptic skeptic skeptic

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the food gods above
pineapple on pizza
has turned our taste buds to a glove oh
our taste buds up above oh

[Pre-Chorus]
we were taken aback in
the pizza parlor when we saw
this topping that broke the rules of
taste and tradition we saw it
but it never did live up to our hopes and dreams
it was a disappointment that left us feeling empty and
disappointed

[Chorus]
pineapple's a pain that makes me a
skeptic skeptic skeptic
pineapple's a flavor that drives me
crazy skeptic skeptic
pineapple oh let it be a mistake that
ruins my meal it came from a mis
take pineapple's a pain that makes me
skeptic skeptic skeptic

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the cheese and the sauce's
flavor we'll stand our ground
pineapple on pizza's a
blunder that's bound to be found

[Pre-Chorus]
but it never did live up to our hopes and dreams
it was a disappointment that left us feeling empty and
disappointed

[Chorus]
pineapple's a pain that makes me a
skeptic skeptic skeptic
pineapple's a flavor that drives me
crazy skeptic skeptic
pineapple oh let it be a mistake that
ruins my meal it came from a mis
take pineapple's a pain that makes me
skeptic skeptic skeptic
