[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need holy water from the pineapple's juice
well little one I don't want
to admit to something so absurd and bizarre
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's bringing home a pineapple surprise for
his dinner delight but his friends
scratched and they're here to roast and critic
on his breath's a pineapple twist and he's a mis
fit and she just wants to exact revenge and get
back it's a battle of taste buds and he
has what my palate lacks she's a pineapple fanatic
and you don't mess with a man's favorite dish even I know that
but she's devised some plan to
stab him in the back with a fork in hand says their friendship
is hanging by a strand so she's been on the web
lately says maybe she'll be my pineapple partner to
spite her man and I know she's tempt
ing me to join her in her quest for pineapple sup
remember suzanne but I shoulda said goodbye suzanne after
the first bite but tonight I am part of the
pineapple craze and I can't deny

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one bite stand turned a two bite stand it
was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and bite in
he found out now she feels deserted and used
'cause he left so what he left pineapple behind
now how am I supposed to tell this friend that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and true
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the studio like a hole in the wall diner
don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
is irreversible I preyed on your love for pineapple
and now that I got you I don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to consume
why do I do this to you and to
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
pineapple detergent and bleach is burn
ing the wound cause now with
her in the womb we can't bring her in this
world shoulda known to use protection before I bit into
your

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a

ple bride hey fuck can I say pineapple
if life was a highway and deceit was an enclave I
'd be swerving In five lanes speeds at a high rate like I
'm slidin' on ice maybe that's why I may
have came at you sideways I
can't keep my lies straight but I made you
terminate my baby this love triangle left
us in a wreck tangled what else can I say
it was fun for a while bet I re
ally woulda loved your smile didnt really want
to abort but what's one more lie to tell or

all my sins need
holy pine

one I don't want to admit
to something so absurd and bizarre truth and mine
lies now are falling like
