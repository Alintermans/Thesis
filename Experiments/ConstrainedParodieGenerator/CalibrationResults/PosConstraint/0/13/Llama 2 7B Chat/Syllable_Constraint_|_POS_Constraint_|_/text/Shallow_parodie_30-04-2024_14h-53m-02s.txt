[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza should not be the thing to do
it's a crime against
good taste and tradition too oh no

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
we're falling
in the pizza world we're longing for something
more than
just a fruit on top of our pie

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
ain't it obvious why pineapple
just don't belong
it's like putting jam on a hot dog it

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
we're falling
in the pizza world we're longing for something
more than
just a fruit on top of our pie

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the che
crash through the surface where the toppings can't
hurt us we're far from the shall

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the ha ha shallow in
the ha ha shallow la la la low
in the ha ha shallow we
are far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ah ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the che
crash through the surface where the toppings can't
hurt us we're far from the shall

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
we're off the deep end watch
as we dive in we'll never meet the
crash through the surface where
toppings can't hurt us we
