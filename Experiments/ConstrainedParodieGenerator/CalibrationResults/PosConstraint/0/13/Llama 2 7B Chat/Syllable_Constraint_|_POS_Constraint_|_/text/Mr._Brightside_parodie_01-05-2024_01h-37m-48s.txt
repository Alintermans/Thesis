[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza should not be the crime of
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
it started out as a topping on a pie and now it
how did it end up in this disgrace and it was
only a topping and now it's taking over
it's in the crust and it's in the cheese and it'
now it's on the plate and it's in my teeth and it
it's a pineapple ap

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's gotta go and it
can't let it stay and
it's takin
control and it's takin' over and it
just can't abide

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza should not be
it's a crime against human
ity and it's a sin and
it's a pineapple shame and
it's a pizza pity and
it's a topping travesty
and it's a flavor
