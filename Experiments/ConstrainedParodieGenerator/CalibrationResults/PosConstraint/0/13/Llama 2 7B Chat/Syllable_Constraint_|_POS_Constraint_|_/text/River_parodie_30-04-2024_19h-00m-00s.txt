[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a crime
been a topping for some poor soul to bite into and regret
all my sweetness and juiciness need holy water to
wash over me well little one
I don't want to admit to something that will
cause pain to those around

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his neck scratched to catch some
flack from the pepperoni and
sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched to
on his breath jack he's a pineapple addict and
she just wants to exact revenge and get back at
it's a pizza match she's on his back like
a pepperoni slice and she's kept track of all his to
ppings choices and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually just pepper
on my last pizza and she has what my ex lacks and she
loves danger psychopath and you don't fuck with
no man's pizza even I know that and she's using me
to try to top him in the game
and I know she's using me to try to play him but
I shoulda said bye suzanne after the first slice but tonight I
am just a pineapple on a pizza and
the truth and my lies now are falling like

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a crime
been a topping for some poor soul to bite into and regret
all my sweetness and juiciness need holy water to
wash over me well little one
I don't want to admit to something that will
cause pain to those around

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand and
it was come sunlight scram now we huff and puff and
he found out now she feels deserted and used
'cause he left so what he did it first to her too
now how am I supposed to tell this pizza that we
are through it's hard to find the toppings when I'm alo
aloof nervous and sue don't want this to hurt but what
you deserve is the truth and don't take it personal I just can't
say this in person to you so I revert to the studio like
hole in the wall diners don't have to
be reserved in a booth I just feel like the person
who I'm turning into irreversible I preyed on you
like it's cheese and now that I got you I don
don't want you took advantage in the
thirst to pursue and now with her in
the womb we can't bring her in this world shoulda
known to use protection before I bit
into your forbidden
fruit fuck and the truth and my lies now are fall
ing like the cheese and the river run and the truth and my lies
now

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a crime
been a topping for some poor soul to bite into and regret
all my sweetness and juiciness need holy water to
wash over me well little one
I don't want to admit to something that will
cause pain to those around

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pepperoni
my name
is
pepperon
iriver run call me
pepperoni we'll let the river

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the topping for some poor soul to
bite Into and regret and fuck can I
say if life was a pizza and deceit was an enclave
I'd be swerving in five lanes speeds at a high rate like
I'm sliding on Ice maybe that's why I
may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my toppings straight but I
made you terminate my pizza this love pizza
left us In a wreck tangled what else can I
say It was fun for a while bet I
really woulda loved your toppings and didn't
really wanna abort but fuck it what's one

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a crime
been a topping for some poor soul to bite into and regret
all my sweetness
and juicien
ness need holy water to wash over
me welllittle
one I don't want to admit
to something that will cause pain to those around me
the truth and my lies now
