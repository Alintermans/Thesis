[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clings like something in
the middle of your slice where it
should be cheese and pepperoni or ham
have you no idea that it's a culinary
disaster waiting to unfold
'cause there's this dish I found
that makes me think of food gone wrong an' I cook it on repeat
until I'm left with a mess on my oven floor

[Pre-Chorus]
should I admit it's true that pineapple doesn't
belong on pizza too are you hopin' it'll stay
we both know that the nights were made for savory
delights that you can't enjoy tomorrow day so

[Chorus]
draggin' back to pine
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
addicted to the
unconventional combo
now I've thought it through
draggin' back to pine

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been pondering if your palate's still
open and if so I wanna know what time
it closes down an' puckers up it's just I'm
constantly on the edge of trying to convince you to give
pineapple on pizza a try but I don't know
if you feel the same as I do but we could be

[Pre-Chorus]
should I admit it's true that pineapple doesn't
belong on pizza too are you hopin' it'll stay
we both know that the nights were made for savory
delights that you can't enjoy tomorrow day so

[Chorus]
draggin' back to pineapple pie draggin
back to pineapple pie drag
'cause I always do maybe it
s just a matter of personal
taste now I've thought it through draggin' back to
pineapple pie draggin' back to
pineapple pie draggin' back
to pineapple pie
draggin' back to

[Outro]
should I admit it's true that pineapple doesn't
belong on pizza it's a culinary view that
we both know that the nights were made for savory
delights that you can't enjoy tomorrow day should
I admit it's true too busy bein' adventur
ous to fall for the traditional way so ever
thought of orderin' in a new and different way should
