[Intro]
is it right to dine with pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once the pie had baked tonight
with the juice of the fruit so bright
I ordered all alone ton
you still refused to

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later on a
platter I see your face and your frown on unsuspecting
pizzaiolis you dream of my pepperoni before it called
you a traitor to the traditional pizza maker's order

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they added pineapple on
was it wrong when they chopped up the ham onion
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now on this

[Post-Chorus]
is it right is it right

[Verse 2]
when you lost control of the
topping game red sauce white
blue cheese on a plate oh no
your new favorite is

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you
there were flashes of
at least I had the decency
to keep my orders out of
only rumors about my pepper
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about adding
exotic toppings just to
see you come running back and
say the one thing I've been wanting but no no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred arguments later on a
table I was hoping you'd be there and say the one thing I've been wanting
but no is it right is it right is it right is it right is it
right is it right is it right is it right is it right is it right

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they added pineapple on
was it wrong when they chopped up the ham onion
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now on this

[Post-Chorus]
is it
right is it right is it
right is
it right is it

[Bridge]
think I didn't see you
there were flashes of
at least I had the decency
to keep my orders out of
only rumors about my pepper
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about adding
exotic toppings just to
see you come running back and say the
one thing I've been wanting but no no no no

[Outro]
flashes of lights oh lord
let's fast forward to three hundred arguments later on a
table I was hoping you'd be there and
say the one thing I've been long
but no is it right is
it right
is it right is it right is it right is it right
