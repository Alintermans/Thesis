[Intro]
come on folksy pie lovers gathered here today

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizza's taste is all wrongton
I propose we leave it alone and move on
why can't we agree on this
an anchor dropped
pineapple's flavor's got us all
stuck in a culinary
quagmire that's hard to dismisseses

[Chorus]
in this world of savors
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of savors
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza purists rise up and
cry out against the pineapple's allure
what kind of madness is this
tomatoes we
should be the only fruit on the
pizza pie's surface or hear
your arguments for the pineapple's worth oh

[Chorus]
in this world of savors
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of savors
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home try new toppings light speed research
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave tradition behind two folks follow
I don't wanna talk about who's ordering it

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was as it was not
the same as it was as
