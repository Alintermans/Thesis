[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you under the bright
pineapple on the pizza seemed such a fright
but I left my palate pure at your brother
's house and you've still got it in your fridge tonight

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple's sweet disposition and my puzzled
gaze we're arguing in the car about this
topping falling down like a debate in progress
and I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
more but I might be okay if I forget the
pineapple

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ordered wrong because you were looking at me with
surprise in your eyes and the
pineapple on the pizza in

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter we were making a scene with
our disagreement about this fruit on top of cheese and tom sauce
and your family's laughing at our debate about the
pineapple on the pizza pie and you told me of
your past and your love for this topping and I thought it was a
joke on me but you were serious and we were
arguing and arguing and arguing and deb
ating and debating and debating and debating
about the pineapple on the
pizza pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about the pineapple
long enough to forget why it

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light about the pineap
ple on the pizza pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you ruined it
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to argue about the pine
apple on the pizza pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you serve me up this pine
apple on the pizza pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie
and I was never
good at keeping my cool but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapple stays the same
from when your pineapple broke my taste buds and bones I'm a
soldier who's returning half my appetite and did the

[Verse 5]
pineapple bruise paint you blue just between us did
the love affair maim you too about the pineapple on the pizza

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I hated you
so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
there I remember it all too
well pineapple on the roof
you remember it all
pineapple on the stairs
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapple stays the
same from when your pineapple broke my taste
buds and bones I'm a soldier who's returning
half my appetite and did the pine
apple bruise paint you blue just between us did the
love affair maim you too and
in this city's barren cold I still rem
ember the first fall of snow and
how it glistened as it fell and

[Outro]
