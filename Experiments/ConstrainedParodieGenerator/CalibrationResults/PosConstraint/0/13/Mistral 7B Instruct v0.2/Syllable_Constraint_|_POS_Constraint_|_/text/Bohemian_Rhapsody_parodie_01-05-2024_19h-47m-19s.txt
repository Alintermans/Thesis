[Intro]

topping fiasco I'm stuck in this culinary
landslide with no escape from this debate pie
I'm just a simple palate I need no em
pathy because I'm easy love easy hate oh pineapple
any way it's sliced doesn't really matter to me to me fine

[Verse 1]

pizza with a ring of pineapple around it's head he
papa pizza life had just
begun but now I've gone and ruined it
papa ooh didn't mean to make you sigh
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow

[Verse 2]
too late my taste buds have
come papa put a fork against my palate pulled the
pineapple from my plate papa life had
just begun but now I've gone and thrown it all
away papa ooh any way the
wind blows I don't want
