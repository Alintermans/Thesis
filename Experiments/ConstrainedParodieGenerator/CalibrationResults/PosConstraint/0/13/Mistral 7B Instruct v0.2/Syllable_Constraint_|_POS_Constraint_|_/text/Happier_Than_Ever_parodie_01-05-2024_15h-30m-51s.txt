[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
pineapple just isn't

[Verse 1]
give it a try before you judge so rashly dear friend
to find a reason to am
end pineapple on our
topping menu again and
do you read our food reviews
or skip our savory av
when you said it was a trend
was our pizza even on your plate's way
we knew when we asked you to share a slice
you'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do and we'd end up in
a tomato sauce surprise
don't say it's a delight
you clearly weren't aware that you ruined our
delightful pizza night so if

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now we're happier
our pizza's better than ever before we wish
we could explain it better to you but pineapple just isn't
the right topping for our

[Verse 2]
you call us crazy for our stance
but pineapple on our pie just
scares us to the core and wasting our breath
we only listen to our loyal
pizza lovers who agree
we don't relate to you and
your pineapple preference too
you made us hate this cuisine

[Verse 3]
and we don't spread rumors about you on the foodie
sphere never told anyone anything
pineapple related but that's just embarrass
ing you were our favorite dish and all
that you did was make us feel distressful
so don't waste our time we don
t have and don't try to make us feel bad for our love
of traditional pizza toppings pure and simple
we could talk about every time that you
showed up on time with a pineapple free pie

[Outro]
you ruined our pizza
always said you were unique but pine
apple just ruined it all
just leave us alone now yeah pineapple
no
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
god
damn it
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
