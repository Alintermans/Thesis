[Verse 1]
twenty five years with this strange
tryin' to figure out the great pineapple
on a pizza scene oh
realized quickly when I took a bite and
saw this fruit on top was not quite right for me and mine
for whatever that means

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I am feeling a little peculiar and
so I wake in the morning and I step outside and
take a deep breath and I get real high and loud
screaming out my question to the crowd
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
I said hey
what's going on with this piney
heyeyey heyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey
what's going on with this piney

[Bridge]
ooh o

ooh uhuh
ooh o

[Verse 2]
and I pine
oh my goodness do we
we pine and pine and
in this kitchen of life
and we ple
oh my goodness do we
we plead every single day
for no pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I am feeling a little peculiar and
so I wake in the morning and I step outside and
take a deep breath and I get real high and loud
screaming out my question to the crowd
what's going on

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
I said hey
what's going on with this pine
heyeyey heyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey
what's going on with this piney
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
wake in the morning and step outside
heyeyey heyeyey hey
take a deep breath and I get real high
heyeyey heyeyey hey
and I scream out my question to
heyeyey heyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey what's going on with this
pineapple on the
heyeyey heyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey

[Outro]
twenty five years and my life
tryin' to figure out this strange pineapple
on a pizza scene oh oh
