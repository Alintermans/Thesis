[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple in
do you ever get that lingering feeling it just doesn
t fit the dish beside it in our
pie another topping chosen
have you no idea that your adding
an unwelcome guest that ruins every bite this
why pineapple on a pizza
that makes me think of
until I take another bite and shake my head in dismay
of your creation I play it on repeat with

[Pre-Chorus]
should I exclude it wassorta hopin' for a
cheese and tomato all the way yet you insist on
we both know the nights were made for savory del
that none can say tomorrow day at the pizza par

[Chorus]
draggin back to pine
ever considered leaving
your beloved pine
since I always
longingly we
red bell pepper new
now I've thought it through draggin
back to pineapple
verse to verses to

[Verse 2]
so have you gone and tried
the combo of sweet and savory in
or is your taste closed and pineapple denied
take it down a notch and give it a second thought before
it sneaks in for a kiss but I don't know if you've explored
but we could be living without the pineapple if
and we both know the nights were made for savory

[Pre-Chorus]
should I exclude it wassorta hopin' for a
cheese and tomato all the way yet you insist on
we both know the nights were made for savory del
that none can say tomorrow day at the pizza par

[Chorus]
draggin back to pine off menu gonna
away leave that unpleasant
our shared love for pizza
since I always believe in our
longing for a traditional pie we
red peppery to choices pure
now I've thought it through draggin
back to pineapple
version to version

[Outro]
should I exclude it wassorta hopin' for a
cheese and tomato all the way yet you insist on
we both know the nights were made for savory del
that none can say tomorrow day at our pizza
were made for savory should I exclude pineapple
awaya leave that unpleasant unexpected guest from
were made for savory should I exclude pineapple we
