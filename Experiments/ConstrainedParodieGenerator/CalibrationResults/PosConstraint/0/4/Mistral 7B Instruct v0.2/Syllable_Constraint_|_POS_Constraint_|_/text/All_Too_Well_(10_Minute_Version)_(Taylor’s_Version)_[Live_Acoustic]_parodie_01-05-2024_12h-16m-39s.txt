[Verse 1]
I approached the table with a slice in hand
but something about its topping made me grand
a ring of pineapple dotted across the
landscape of my palate left me feeling quite

[Verse 2]
our friendship strong didn't prepare us for this test
your devoted dedication to the fruit
distracted us both as we debated the rest
of our shared mealtime and our future

[Pre-Chorus]
and I shake my head aware
this fruity ingredient
and my taste buds aren't amused at all fair oh
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are once more at the dinner table
your justification for the pineapple on the pizza
chomp chomp I was there shaking
my head remembering it all

[Verse 3]
memories persist of a conversation we share rec
alling back the time when we used to partake in the ordinary
but you've upped the stakes with your culinary creations unt
heard of before and my taste buds are anything but
orignal we argued till our voices grew faint saying
pineapple doesn't belong on our pizza
or our shared history for that matter to this
day let's just agree it's a debate we can't settle
as our arguing escal
ated all sorts of mayhem ensued leaving
onlookers wondering what
the fuss was all about oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
and there we are once more at the dinner table oh

[Pre-Chorus]
and we can't remember
a time when we agreed on this
and our continuing in our
disagreement makes us realize

[Chorus]
'cause there we are once more in endless debate at the
dinner table we've reached a stalemate at the pepperoni
plate I remember it
our repeated arguments
and there we are once again caught in the middle of
our continued our inability to see
whether pineapple or
no pineapple is the way to be

[Bridge]
maybe somewhere in translation lost in
our love for the pizza
we've gotten carried away with our
passion for our
topping preferences
our continuing our
and our continuing our topping preferences
our continuing our topping preferences oh
our continuing our continuing
our continuing our

[Verse 4]
it hasn't ended well despite our best attempts
our love for pizza has been tested
your dedication to the pineapple has never wavered steadfast
but in my opinion it
just doesn't seem to last our ongoing
disagreement threatens to tear us apart splitting us down the middle
down the middle of the argument
all thanks to the pineapple on our
pizza and our
our our continuing our unw
illingness to compromise our ongoing
our continuing our unwillingness to compromise
our continuing our our continuing

[Verse 5]
life won't be the same despite our growing
older our love for pizza will remain unchanged yet still our
disagreement lingers like a stubborn stain never
fading away our continuing our
and our continuing our continued
perseverance in our continuing our
our continuing not
forgetting our continuing

[Chorus]
at the dinner table once again we
once more in our continuing our heated
our continuing
our continuing our
our continuing in
our continuing
our continuing
our continuing
our continuing
our continuing our

[Verse 6]
and our continuing our continued persever
ance in our continuing our unw
illingness to compromise our love
for our preferred toppings our growing
older has only strengthened our
conviction that our continuing our
our continuing the
our continuing our our
our continuing our

[Outro]
