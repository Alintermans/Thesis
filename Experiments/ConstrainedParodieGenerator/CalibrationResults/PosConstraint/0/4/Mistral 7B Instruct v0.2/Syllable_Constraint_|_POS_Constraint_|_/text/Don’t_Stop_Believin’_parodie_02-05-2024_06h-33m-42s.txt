[Verse 1]
just a small pie globefrom a silly world of
its toppings mismatchedit took the midnight
a picky eaterfrom a town of pineapple
he tookthe midnight train avoidin' that fruiton

[Verse 2]
a server in the kitchenwith
the sickly over pineapple
for a taste they can part icky
it goes against the grain and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
table waitin
palsaround the boulevard
they're wonderin' in the nightwhy
peppers people
livin'just to find delightin
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
fightin' sweetnessevery
crave unexpected icky
forkfoot to order icky delight
just one more bite

[Verse 4]
some prefer will icky
some serve icky up their sle
oh the pizzaneverends
it goes against the grain and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
table waitin
palsaround the boulevard
they're wonderin' in the nightwhy
peppers people
livin'just to find delightin
hidin' somewhere in the night
