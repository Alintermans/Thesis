[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a greedyone seeking pine
been a lover trying to
been a cheat putting it on the pie might seem fine but not mine
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna cause heated
arguments or we'll never again become friends
so let the dialogue

[Verse 1: Eminem]
it's a food fight in the kitchen heated up
pine slices or chunks disperses
on his plate to face criticism
and she just has objections filled with persistence
it's a taste battle her dedication so fierce
her dedication to tradition that
and you don't mix up the flavors even I know that
but she's devised a plan to change his palate her crusade begins with
asparagus in hand says
pineapple on my pizza isn't meant to be tasted
'cause she loves tradition a purist at heart her taste
and you don't mess with a chef's creation even if
she's come up with a solution
filled with her resolve her will power remains strong when
she's been on the web lately says maybe she'll be my rosemary
to spite her partner and I know she's using
me to sway his opinion I don't

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a deceiver keeping
been a saboteur trying
all my sins need sweet sympathy wasting over our shared
well little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it's gonna compromise
our friendship then I'd rather hide the truth and
the pineapple on the

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a late night ordering a wrong order
his beloved took it bitterly far from being
a laughing matter it's a serious or
debate now he's left her feeling deserted
and used but he left so what's the use of trying to
tell her that it's through it's hard for him to find the words
knowing how much this means to her he doesn't want to hurt
letting her down it's not an easy thing to do no matter how much he
longs to be truthful but he's reverted to the studio hiding
behind the mic like a sanctuary
it's a pattern he can't seem to reverse in his
thirst to preserve his reputation as a culinary
innovator but now that he's got her he
don't want her part of his recipe
how could he have been so inconscons
considering the consequences of his dish
regrets but decides speaking would only
just further complicate
his predicament so he'll just wait it out
hoping that time will heal the wound he's inflicted on our
rel

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a deceiver keeping

now let the dialogue continue

[Verse 3: Eminem]
perfectionist at heart always the pur
pleaser hoping my adding pine creates
an explosion of flavors but it's left me in a bind
taste after taste I can't seem to find the balance
every attempted combination
my dedication never
but my dedication to surprising
the customers grows stronger it's an addiction
my willpower won't allow me accept
definitions of tradition should
pushboundaries not merely reproduce same
what goes around comes around it's a cycle

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a receiver adding
been an innovator tried
all my crimes asking for sympathy trying to justify
well little one
it seems wrong
I wouldn't want to commit to something
our shared
if that's going to lead to pain
the truth and my lies now falling icing on this
