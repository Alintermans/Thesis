[Intro]
is this a silly world filled with absurd fol
found a tropical fruit on my savory roll call
open your mouths gazing upward to the trees
I speak of pineapple wrongly placed upon
easily added then easily prone to gloomanyway
the tabletop winds determine my disposition not my own

[Verse 1]
broke the harmony of
pledged a blade next to the pineapple I adore now it
borders collapse leaving just
but now I've brought this dish to the table
mothers gasp did I ruin the meal they
carry on carrying on as if nothing
repeat after me as though it matters not at alla

[Verse 2]
soon destined departure
goose bumps rise my taste buds aching following a bite
ohhh cruelty my trusted companionfare
I screama go my anguish at the table
mothers ohhany way pineapple
I refuse to accept
sometimes long for the days of simplicity

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I behold a curious figure before
pepperoni man standing his groundwith a pizza
flashes before my eyes so startling me he's our her
cheese abundant bountiful bountiful bountiful bountiful bountiful bountiful bountiful delight
but I myself simply a traditional
our loved one a traditional pizza
won't you kindly remove this anom
extra ingredient free go go go go
resists release go go go releasing
go go go release go go go release go go
go go go release me release me releasing
go go releasing go go go

go go go releasing go go go release go

hungerful hungerful hungerful hungerful wanting only

[Verse 4]
why you tryin'to impose your will I say stop that
so you believe yourself entitled to my plate
oh girl won't let this offend my be eth
just gotta leave this table just gotta leave just now

[Outro]
