[Intro]
is it pineapple off a pizza gone

[Verse 1]
once the pepper had fallen
melted cheese forming a puddle
your palate wascalling yet
they served it up with

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later sadly
our beloved meats parted by an unwelcome invader
they daydreamed of our culinary creations before
our sacred dishes tainted by an intruder at table

[Chorus]
was it tampered when they put pineapple on
was it tampered when they drizzled sweet sauce on
top of our savory fe
st in your dream as you slept soundly
was it violated then and is it now

[Post-Chorus]
is it altered is it

[Verse 2]
texture clashing combining
sweet fusion unlikely
tomatoes grinning on a
pineapple's invasion

[Bridge]
did you think we didn't notice that
another ingred
ient snuck its way in amongst us
only rumors of our
taste palate's demise lingering
but we kept our
composure hiding our dis
pleasure oh lord we ponder
jumping off eating places
just to see you come running back saying please

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred food fights later happily
that pineapple's gone from our pies and our pizzas for good surely
they daydreamed of our untarnished creations before it
our sacred dishes no longer tainted by an unwelcome

[Chorus]
was it defiled when they placed pineapple
was it defiled when they added sweet sauce
on top of our savory
feasts in your dream as you slumbered
was our culinary harmony then

[Post-Chorus]
restored
is our creation
return
to its former

[Bridge]
was it respected was
it valued was it
appreciated oh lord we
celebrated the return
of our savory creations
free from unwelcome
intrusion oh lord we rejo
iced in the delicious taste
now that pineapple's gone from our
plates was it redeemed then and is it redeemed

[Outro]
foods restored unity
let's fast forward to three hundred shared meals later blissfully
honoring our culinary cre
ations free from unwelcome
pineapple invasion
and the
one thing we've been craving was it restored then and
