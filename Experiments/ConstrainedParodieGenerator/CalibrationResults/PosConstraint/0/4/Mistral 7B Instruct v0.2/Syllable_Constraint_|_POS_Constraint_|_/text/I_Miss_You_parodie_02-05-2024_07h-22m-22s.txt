[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I blame you my beloved

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pineapple on our
the disturbance at the pizza party
an ingredient unwel
on cheese and tomatoes lies
our amicable relationship if
where our beloved pizza
and our shared delighted peace off
in the night we'll cry dolefully this
our beloved pizza

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I blame you my beloved
I blame you my beloved

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where have you gone my dearest friend
my hatred for this fruit is deep tonight
I need consistency and then
this controversial
flavorless impediment comes creeping on
and in my mind I counted
the reasons for this anat
be fruit on savory dishes it
that bring division and hatred
will you reconsider and
take it off before it ruins our
pizza night tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't let yourself be tainted by it dear
you're already the voice
my desired pizza
don't let ourselves be tainted by it
you're already the voice
my desired pizza

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't let it ruin our pizza we
the voice inside our
my desired pizza
don't let it ruin our pizza we
the voice inside our
my desired pizza
let's keep our culinary dreams alive
the voice inside our
my desired pizza
let's keep our culinary dreams alive
the voice inside our
my desired pizza

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I blame you my beloved
I blame you my beloved
we're already the voice
my desired pizza
