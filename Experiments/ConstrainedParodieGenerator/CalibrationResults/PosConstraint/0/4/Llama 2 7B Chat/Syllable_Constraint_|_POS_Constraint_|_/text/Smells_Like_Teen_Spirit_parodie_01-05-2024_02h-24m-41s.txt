[Verse 1]
don't put pineapple on
it doesn't belong on a pie
it'll ruin the flavor of the che
and make it taste like the sky blue

[Pre-Chorus]
don't bring it to the table
it doesn't belong in a bow
leave it in the tropics where it
left alone with the co

[Chorus]
pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza it's a crime against the
its flavor and texture don't
mix with the cheese and the sauce in
a match made in culinary
heaven pineapple has no place

[Post-Chorus]
on a pie

[Verse 2]
the toppings are simple and
classic pepperoni and
mushrooms and olives too yes please do
but pineapple is a no go

[Pre-Chorus]
don't bring it to the table
it doesn't belong in a bow
leave it in the tropics where it
left alone with the co

[Chorus]
pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza it's a crime against the
its flavor and texture don't
mix with the cheese and the sauce in
a match made in culinary
heaven pineapple has no place

[Post-Chorus]
on a pie

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]

putting pineapple on your pie
it's a crime against humanit√©
and we won't hesitate to

[Pre-Chorus]
don't bring it to the table
it doesn't belong in a bow
leave it in the tropics where it
left alone with the co

[Chorus]
pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza it's a crime against the
its flavor and texture don't
mix with the cheese and the sauce in
a match made in culinary
heaven pineapple has no place
