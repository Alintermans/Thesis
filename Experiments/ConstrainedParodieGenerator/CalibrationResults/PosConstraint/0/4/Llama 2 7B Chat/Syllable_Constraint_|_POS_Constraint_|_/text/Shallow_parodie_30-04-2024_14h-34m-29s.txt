[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
oh no no no no no no no no
it doesn't belong
on a pizza it don't go no

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I refuse
to eat it when it's time to choose my toppings
it's a
disgrace to the pizza universe

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
can you imagine
seeing pineapple slices on a pie
it's a crime against
the pizza family tree oh my oh

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I won't
tolerate it when it comes to toppings on
ugh it
just can't stand the thought of it no

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'll never eat it peacefully night or
day pineapple never
never on a pizza always a fight just
no no no no no no no

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pineal gaba
in the brain tumor gaba gaba
in the hipshot madness ag
we'll never forsake the norm

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh hi haha
ohia oh

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'll never eat it peacefully night or
day pineapple never
never on a pizza always a fight just
no no no no no no no

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the cheese house gaba
in the anchovies zone gaba zone
in the meat lovers field
our pizza never yields
