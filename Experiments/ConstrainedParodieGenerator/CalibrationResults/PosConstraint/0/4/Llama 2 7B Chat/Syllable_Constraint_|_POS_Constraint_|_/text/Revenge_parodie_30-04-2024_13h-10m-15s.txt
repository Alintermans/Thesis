[Intro]
oh no pineapple on my pizza
it's a crime against human dec
I can't believe you would even
consider putting it on
it belongs

[Verse]
in a tropical paradise
where the sun always shines and the beaches are always nice
not on my pizza oh no way it
offends my taste buds every single day
an abomination an aff
offense to the pizza gods above it's a sinful act
when will you learn oh pineapple lovers
that pizza is not a fruit salad it's a savory treat
our sacred tradition of
topping our pies with cheese and pepperoni alone
is the only way to go don't
dare to stray from this path oh no pineapple
no no no no no no no no
and I'm singing this song with all of my might and might it
be heard by all of humanity so
they know the horror of pineapple on pizza is real and

[Chorus]
no pineapple on
my pizza no no
pineapple no no no no
no pineapple on
my pizza no no no no
no pineapple on

[Outro]
so listen up and
heed my warning my dear
pineapple belongs on
a fruit salad not on pizza
protect
