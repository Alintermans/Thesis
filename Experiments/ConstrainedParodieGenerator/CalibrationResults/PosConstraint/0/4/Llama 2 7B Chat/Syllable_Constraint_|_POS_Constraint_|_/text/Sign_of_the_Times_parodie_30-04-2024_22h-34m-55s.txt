[Verse 1]
pineapple has no place on a pizza dear
it's a topping confusion
don't get me wrong I love a
sweet and savory treat but not on a pieces
of bread that's meant to be che
devoured with a passion

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza to
choices should be our own but alas
it's not always the case
we're stuck in a world of toppings de
far removed from the original taste
we never learn our

[Chorus]
stop your crying pineapple it's not pizza
it's a crime against humanité
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here stupid
pineapple on a pizza is
an abomination before

[Verse 2]
so put down the pineapple and walk away
let's find a new topping to
play with today maybe some
bbq chicken or some bacon bits
our tastebuds will thank
us for the change of pace so

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza to
choices should be our own but alas
it's not always the case
we're stuck in a world of toppings de
far removed from the original taste
we never learn our

[Chorus]
stop your crying give pineapple a break it
belongs on a fruit salad not
on a pizza it's a mistake
we gotta get away from here stupid it
ain't pineapple on a pie
it's a crime against humanité

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza to
choices should be our own but alas
it's not always the case
we're stuck in a world of toppings de
far removed from the original taste
we never learn our

[Bridge]
we can do better than
this pineapple mad
ness it's time to break free
from the topping chain
our tastebud
heritage will thank

[Outro]
stop your crying try some new toppings instead of
pineapple on a pie
it's a crime against humanité go away go
go away go away go away go away
go away go away go out
go away go away go out
go away go away go out
