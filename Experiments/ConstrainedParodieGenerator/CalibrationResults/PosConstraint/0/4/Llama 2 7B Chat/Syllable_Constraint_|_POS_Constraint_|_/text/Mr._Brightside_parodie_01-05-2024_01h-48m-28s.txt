[Verse]
step away from the pineapple on my pizza pie
ain't no good for my taste buds up in the air
it was a topping that I never knew I didn't like
how did it end up on this pie anyways oh
now I've got a problem that I can't ignore
it's like a flavor that I just can't ignore
back to plain cheese for me tomorrow and I'm feel
and my tastebuds are

[Pre-Chorus]
but my friends keep tellin' me
to give it another
gotta keep
but I'm stickin' to my guns and my taste
let them have their fun

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza is a crime
ain't nobody got time
for that sweet and savory
clashin' flavors in my mouth
aint doin' it anymore
gonna stick with what I know
like a classic marg
