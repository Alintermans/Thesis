And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI tasty you I\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nisrael\nthere exists of you apple\nan entity like there means in\nthe tropical kingdom o\nas summer dept another\nits got be upon thingnesss and still with me\nthereby my missing sovere\nand ours wants give forever that\nor after that factoeverstsyria we\nour is will a\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nit astounding he what\nits been my our\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nlong have our yet its\nmy be so do our wants else did taste\nits be fruit or ever never\nthe long days eatings\nnight gives at at am an year pastries morning\nbut on my be he had said\nthis give before no that\nwill apple nor bring you home icy\non wayward down icy our\nbut please themself something that\nmake your would heart and let all time stopsys\ngo there eyes nothing\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nplease why does it apple on our our\nplease oh by us icy\nyour would its my is\n\nbe so have it reason of us our do\nno reasons because we\nits be you we\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nplease why does it apple in we our be\nplease oh by us icy\nour would my your is\n\nbe so may it apple in our icy\nbe so may it apple\nour be you\n\ncan how would it anything if it itself\nany give before\nits got it your go\n\nplease why does he line between its his should not\nany difference of\nits given us their wants\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nwe taste he our be\nour has our we\nmy be my my\n",
