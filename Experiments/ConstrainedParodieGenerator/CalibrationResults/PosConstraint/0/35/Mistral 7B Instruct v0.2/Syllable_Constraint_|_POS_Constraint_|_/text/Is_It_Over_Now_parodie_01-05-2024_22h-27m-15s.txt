[Intro]
do pineapples belongon my pizza

[Verse 1]
once the circle formed
within an edge at the border
your toppings no longer norm
my pineapple is

[Pre-Chorus]
letting's fast reflect on seven hundred for pizza nights
your beloved meats and cheeses weary in your tired eyesight
you daydream of me versus on our delivered heightside
your taste buds search yearningly for something with more biteydelight

[Chorus]
have we thrown away our amoring
did my topping really souring happen
lies longingly your whispered near
before your preference in my ear
will our toppings nevermore be sharing

[Post-Chorus]
should your goating
