[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the topping from my pizza
the surprise in the delivery of
the fruit that doesn't belong
on a pie that's supposed to
be savory and hot and sweet and neatly
we can live without pineapp
and still enjoy our pizza night
and in the kitchen we'll dance and
sing and wish this never

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the flavor you promised
I cannot taste it anymore when you
add pineapple to my pizza
it's like a betray
almonds and olives and pepperoni too
but pineapple no thank you
it's like a sin to me and
my taste buds revolt at the sight of
don't waste your toppings on me
you're already in my heart
lost your pineapple charm and won't
be part of our

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your pineapple on me you see
it's already in the
recycling bin of
I miss pineapple on none of my pizza
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your pineapple on me you see
it's already in the
recycling bin of
I miss pineapple on none of my pizza
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
don't waste your pineapple on me you see
it's already in the
recycling bin of
I miss pineapple on none of my pizza
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
