[Verse]
I'm comin' out of my pineapple
and I've been doin' just fineeeyyeeeeyyeeeeyyeeeeyyeeeeyyeeeeyyeeeeyyeeeeyyeeeeyyeeeeyyeee
gotta gotta be down because I don't want it all
it started out with a slice and how did it end
up like this up like this up like this up like this
now I'm dreamin' of pepperoni and she's call
in a chopper and he's takin' a dragonfly
now they're goin' to the

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's toppings his pizza
he takes off her apron
let me go
and I just can't look it's killin' me
and takin' control

[Chorus]
jealousy turnin' pineapples into
swimmin' through sick lullabies
chokin' on your alibis
but it's just the price I pay
destination is callin
open up my hungry
'cause I'm mr pepper

[Guitar Solo]
