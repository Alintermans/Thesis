[Verse 1]
pineapple
don't you dare put it on my pizza
it's a crime against culina
the way it should be made is with
pepperoni and sausage and

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you know that it's just not right taking a
delicious topping and
ruining the perfect pie with your
sweet and savory delight no

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet
of cheese and sauce and toppings galore
but pineapple on a pizza
just don't belong on the floor no more no more no
no more no more no more no more
do you hear me no more no more
please no more no more no more no
do you hear me no more no more

[Chorus]
pineapple you don't belong on
my pizza oh no no
pineapple you don't belong on
my pizza oh no no
pineapple you don't belong on my pie
oh no no no no no no no no
please no more no more no more no more
do you hear me no more

[Verse 3]
third things third
I'll never understand why you ins
keep trying to make a
pretzel of a pizza with a fruit that
just doesn't go together no

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet
of cheese and sauce and toppings gal
but pineapple on a pizza
just don't belong on the floor
no more no more no more no more no more no more no
do you hear me no more no more no more no more no more no
please no more no

[Chorus]

ppings that I know and love no

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet of cheese and sauce and to
ppings galore but pineapple on a pizza just don't be
long on my plate
