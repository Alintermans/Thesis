[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
how could you even consider such a sin
it's like putting cheese on a hot dog or pe
but no one ever thinks of the poor pizza

[Verse 2]
the toppings are so carefully chosen and arranged
to complement each other in perfect harm
but pineapple is just a clash of flavors
like a drum solo at a funeral march

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that taste is not here no more
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
because there we are again at the local
pizza joint with the pineapple on top of the pie like a
blight on the landscape of cul
good taste and decency and oh

[Verse 3]
I dreamt last night of a pizza without the pineapple
the cheese was melted to perfection the crust was crispy and
the toppings were all in harmony like a symphony or
a masterpiece of flavor and texture and oh god
but then I woke up and reality hit me like a ton
of bricks and I'm left here with this bitter taste in
my mouth and the knowledge that it will never be the
same again because of that accursed pineapple on
top of the pie like a tick on
a sacred cow and oh how I wish I could
forget about it but al
the memory lingers on and on and on like a bad
song and I can't escape it no matter how hard

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that taste is not here no more and
I might be okay but I'm not fine at
all oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
because there we are again at the localpond
pizza joint with the pineapple on top of the pie like a
blight on the landscape of
good taste and decency and oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I love you guys so much but I will never understand
why you would do this to
the pizza community and oh

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
until you tore it
all up like a pine tree
and oh how I wish I could go
back in time and slap myself silly for even suggesting
such a monstrous abomination of a topping on a
pizza and oh how I wish I could go back in
time and take it all away and

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm
in a new hell because of this pineapp
he'll on my pizza and oh how I wish I could go back in time and
slap myself silly for e
even suggesting such a monstrous abom
ination of a topping on a pizza and oh how I wish I could
go back in time and take it all way
and oh how I wish I could forget the
taste of that pineapp
le on my pizza and oh how I wish I
could go back in time and slap myself silly for
even suggesting such a monstrous abomination of a
topping on a pizza and oh how I wish I could go

[Verse 5]
I know I'm not alone in this fight I know there
are others out there who feel the same way I do about this pineapp
on a pizza controversy and oh how I wish
I could rally them all together and march on
the pizza joints of the world and demand that they
take that accursed pineapple off of the pie and
put something else on there that
makes sense and oh how I wish I

[Chorus]
because there we are again at the loc
al pizza joint with the pineapple on top of the
pie like a blight on the
landscape of good taste and decen
cy and oh oh oh oh oh
