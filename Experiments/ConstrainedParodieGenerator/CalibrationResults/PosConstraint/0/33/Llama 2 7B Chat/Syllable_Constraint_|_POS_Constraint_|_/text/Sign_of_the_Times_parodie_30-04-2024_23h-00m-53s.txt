[Verse 1]
don't put pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against human
it doesn't belong on a pie
it's like putting ketchup on a steak and saying
it's a cultural abom
ination and a gastric

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza ways
we keep making the same mistakes each day
putting toppings that don
don't belong together in a
dish that's supposed to be a delight and
a culinary joy

[Chorus]
just stop your crying and listen to our
plea don't put pine
on a pizza it's a no go
we gotta get away from this topping
and find something that's more fitting
for the dish that we're making it

[Verse 2]
we know you think it's a novelty but trust
us it's not worth the fight and
struggle of trying to
defend pineapple on a pizza it
just doesn't make any sense
it's like putting chocolate on

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza ways
we keep making the same mistakes each day
putting toppings that don
don't belong together in a
dish that's supposed to be a delight and
a culinary joy

[Chorus]
just stop your crying and listen to our
plea don't put pineapple on
a pizza it's a no go we
gotta get away from this topping and find
something that's more fitting for the
dish that we're making it just stop

[Pre-Chorus]
we never learn our pizza ways
we keep making the same mistakes each day
putting toppings that don
don't belong together in a
dish that's supposed to be a delight and
a culinary joy

[Bridge]
we know you may think it
adds a unique flav
but trust us it's not worth
the confusion and
arguments that it
causes we just want

[Outro]
so please don't put pineapple on
a pizza it's a sign
of the times and a culinary crime we got
to get away from this topping and find something
that's more fitting for the dish that
we're making it just stop your cried
baby it's a sign of the times
