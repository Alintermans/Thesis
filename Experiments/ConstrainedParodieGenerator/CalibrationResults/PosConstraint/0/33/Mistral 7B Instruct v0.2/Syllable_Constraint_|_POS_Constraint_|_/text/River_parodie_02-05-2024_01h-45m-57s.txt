[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pirate leading a
been a jester causing a
been a lover of pineapple on my pizza pie deceived
but little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it causes is disharm
the truth and my lies now are falling like the palm
so let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he brings home a pizza with a pineapple
toppings mismatched and unsavvy
on his breath's pepperoni he's a
and she just wants to exact revenge and get back
it's a battle of tastefulness she's on his
she keeps track of every order he
and guess who just happens to be ordering off the list
'cause she hates the taste that my ex had misseded she's a pineapple fan
because she loves novelty
and you don't mess with no one's pizza
but she's devised some plan to sabotage his dish
knife in hand says their friendship's hanging by
so she's been on the phone lately
says maybe she'll be my pepperoni lover to
and I know she's using me to try to play him I don't
carrot top but I shoulda said pineapple
after the first slice but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pirate leading a
been a jester causing a
been a lover of pineapple on my pizza pie deceived
but little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it causes is disharm
the truth and my lies now are falling like the palm
so let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one slice turned a two slice
it was come midnight scram now we hugged tight and
he found out now she feels betrayed
'cause he removed it so what did she say to me
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm nervous and rue I don
t want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth don
t take it personal I just can't say this in person to you so
I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners I just
feel like the person I'm turning into
pineapple eater I preyed on you like it's
pizza party now that I got you I don't want you pine
apple pie in my face I took advantage
in my hunger to satisfy my taste
why do I do this harm that I
get on my soapbox and preach my reasoning and
detergent and cleanser is burning the
wound because now with her
we can't bring her in this world shoulda
used protection before I bit into your forbidden fruit
che

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pirate leading a
been a jester causing a
been a lover of pineapple on my pizza pie deceived
but little one I don't want to admit to something
if all it causes is disharm
the truth and my lies now are falling like the palm
so let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pizza my name
river
o
iver run
call me pizza call me
ooh river we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never
fuck can I say if pineapple was
and deceit was an enemy I'd swervein thousand ways
speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin
on pineapple I may have came at you
sideways I can't keep mine
but I made you remove my baby pie
this pineapple love left us in a
what else can I say it was fun for a while
bet I really woulda loved your smile
didn't really wanna abort but fuck it
what's one more lie to tell our unborn

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pirate leading a
been a jester causing a
been a lover of pineapple on my pizza pie deceived
but little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to something
if all it
causes is disharmony the
truth and my lies now are falling like the palm trees
so let the river run
