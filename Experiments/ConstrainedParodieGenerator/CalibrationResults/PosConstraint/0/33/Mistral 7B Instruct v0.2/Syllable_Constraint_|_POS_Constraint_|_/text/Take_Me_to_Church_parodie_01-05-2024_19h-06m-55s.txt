[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
he's the sneer at the barbecue with
pineapple on the pizza ruins
I should've chosen better fruits
if the heavens ever did speak
they'd warn me against this
every summer's gettin
an unwanted ingred
we were born with good taste they say it
my kitchen offers no respite
she insists I add the pineapple
the only disaster I'll endure
is when I'm alone with you
I was born with good tastebut
can't resist the pine

[Pre-Chorus]
a pity
pity pie pit

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship at the altar of your blunderful
I'll list my reasons and you can sharpen your cut
offer me that bitter fruit
oh good chef allow me to partake
take me to the
I'll worship at the altar of your blunderful
I'll list my reasons and you can sharpen your cut
offer me that bitter fruit
oh good chef allow me to partake

[Verse 2]
if I'm a gourmand of the
my lover's the season
to keep the gourmet on
he craves a sacrifice pine
make the entire ocean empty
fetch me something savory and
that's a fine lookin'
what you got in the freezer
we've a crowd of famished food
that looks delicious that looks fine
this is ravenous

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship at the altar of your blunderful
I'll list my reasons and you can sharpen your cut
offer me my bitterest
oh good chef allow me to partake
take me to the
I'll worship at the altar of your blunderful
I'll list my reasons and you can sharpen your cut
offer me my bitterest
oh good chef allow me to partake

[Bridge]
no perfection in the culinary arts when
this senselessness our palates embrace in our
on this absurdity of a culinary
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh pity
pity pie pit

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship at the altar of your blunderful
I'll list my reasons and you can sharpen your cut
offer me that bitter fruit
oh good chef allow me to partake
take me to the
I'll worship at the altar of your blunderful
I'll list my reasons and you can sharpen your cut
offer me that bitter fruit
oh good chef allow me to partake
