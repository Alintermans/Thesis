[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a place for pineapple on
a pizza pie so round and grandest
but now I see the error
you agree

[Verse]
I've ordered two pizzas for
myself and you with pineapple galore unloved and sore
oh gosh we've all tasted dishes that
just don't belong on our plate this is
the price we pay for being bold
some add anchovies some put on olives and pineapple
and you'd have thought that I would let it go
but my taste buds say nooooohhohohoohhohoohoohohooho
in the realm of gastronomy
brotherhoods are formed for what's right today's food trend is tom
orrow's mistake I don't wanna
let it gooooohhohohohohohoohohoh
and in my grave I'll rot with pine
apple on my pizza pie oh noooohohohohooho
I've ordered two pizzas for
myself and you with pineapple galore unloved and sore this

[Chorus]
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rototot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rototot
in my grave I'll rot

[Outro]
in my grave I'll rot
I'll rot I'll rot I'll rot
is my disdain
is all of your culinary
delight
