[Verse 1]
twenty five pies and
my life's still a struggle to climb this great big
pineapple hill of dis
belief for a culinary vision
for a reason I knew I should've known better than
to trust this pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I see a pizza
just to get it all out what's
in my head and I feel a little peculiar
and so I wake in the morning and I look outside
and I take a deep breath and I take a
long sigh and I shout from the top of
my lungs screaming

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyey heyhey
heyeyey
I said hey what's going on with
this pineapple on a
pizza hey
heyeyey heyhey heyeyey heyhey heyeyey hey

[Bridge]
ooh o

ooh uh hum
ooh o
o
ooh uh hum

[Verse 2]
and I pine
oh my goodness do we
always try to make
this combination work
and I pine
oh my goodness do we
pray every single day for
a change in our

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I see a pizza
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I feel a little peculiar and sobbing
and so I wake in the morning and I look outside
and I take a deep breath and I shake my head
and I shout from the top of my lungs
what's happening

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyey heyhey
heyeyey heyhey
I said hey what's going on
with this pineapple on
a pizza
heyeyey heyhey heyeyey heyhey heyeyey hey
and I say heyeyey heyhey
heyeyey heyhey heyeyey heyhey heyeyey heyeyey hey
and I say
woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
and I say
woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
and I say heyeyey heyhey
heyeyey heyhey heyeyey heyhey heyeyey heyeyey hey
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
and I say
woah oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Bridge]
ooh o
o
ooh uh hum

[Outro]
twenty five pies and my life
is still a struggle to climb this great big pine
apple hill of disbelief
