I know this topping it's
a crime against flavor and tradition but
you just keep on putting it on your pie
and pretending it's okay but
it's not okay it's just not okay oh no oh

[Additional Lyrics]
there was a time when pineapple
was a tropical treat but now
it's just a pizza topping that's oh so beat
and every bite is a crime and
it's not a hallelujah it
it's a culinary sin oh no oh no oh

[Additional Lyrics]
maybe there's a god above
who loves pineapple on a pie
but for those of us who know the truth it's just
a taste that doesn't belong oh no oh
it's a cold and it's a broken hal
hallelujah hallelujah ah pineapple
