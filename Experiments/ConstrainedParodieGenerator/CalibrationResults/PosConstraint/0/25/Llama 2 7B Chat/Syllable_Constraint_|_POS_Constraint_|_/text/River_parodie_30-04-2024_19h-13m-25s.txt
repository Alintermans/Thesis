[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a crime
been a topping for some poor soul to bite into and regret
all my sweetness and juiciness need holy water to
wash over me well little one
I don't want to admit to something that will
cause pain to those around

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his neck scratched to catch some
flack from the pepperoni and
sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched to
on his breath jack he's a pineapple addict and
she just wants to exact revenge and get back at
it's a pizza match she's on his back like
a pepperoni slice and she's kept track of all his to
ppings choices and guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
actually just pepper
on my last pizza and she has what my ex lacks and she
loves danger psychopath and you don't fuck with
no man's pizza even I know that and she's using me
to try to top him in the game
and I know she's using me to try to play him but
I shoulda said bye suzanne after the first slice but tonight I
am a pineapple on a pizza and the
truth and my lies now are falling like the

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a crime
been a topping for some poor soul to bite into and regret
all my sweetness and juiciness need holy water to
wash over me well little one
I don't want to admit to something that will
cause pain to those around

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand and
it was come sunlight scram now we huff and puff and
he found out now she feels deserted and used
'cause he left so what he did it first to her too
now how am I supposed to tell this pizza that we
're through it's hard to find the toppings I'm aloof nervous
and don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the
toppings don't take it personal I just can't say this in person
to you so I revert to the studio like hole in the wall din
don't have to be reserved in a slice
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into
irreversible I preyed on you like it's church at the pie
and now that I got you I don't want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do I do this dirt that I do
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burnin' the sau
'cause now with you in the o
we can't bring you in this world shoulda knew
to use protection fore I bit into your forbidden to

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a crime
been a topping for some poor soul to bite into and regret
all my sweetness and juiciness need holy water to
wash over me well little one
I don't want to admit to something that will
cause pain to those around

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's pepperoni

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the toppings always the toppings
life was a pizza and deceit was an
enclave I'd be swerving in five lanes like I'm slidin' on
ice maybe that's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my toppings straight butter
what else can I say
it was fun for a while but bet I would
a loved your toppings dearly what else can I say
it was fun for a while but bet I would a
loved your toppings dearly and the truth
and my lies now are falling like the rain and
let the river run and the truth and my lies

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a crime
been a topping for some poor soul to bite into and regret
all my sweetness
and juicine
need holy water to wash over me
well little
I don't want to admit to
something that will cause pain to those around me well
little one I'm sorry
