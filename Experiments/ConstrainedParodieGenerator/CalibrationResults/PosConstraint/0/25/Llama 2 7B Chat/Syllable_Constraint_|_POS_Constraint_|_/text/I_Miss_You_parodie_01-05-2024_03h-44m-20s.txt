[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the topping from my nightmare
the disgrace in the pizza world above
the unsuspecting
of flavor and tradition
we can live without pineapple if we want
and avoid the heat of the
and in the oven we'll
wish this topping never ends up on us
wish this topping never

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the balance nowadays
I cannot taste it when I eat it out
I need a topping that's worth the
this sweet and spicy
compares to the flavor of a real topping
and as I stare at the pie
the pineapple stares back
like a betrayal to the classic
will you come back and respect the
tradition of the pizza
and stop this pineapple invasion ton
stop this pineapple

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
it's already on the
I miss pineapple on
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
it's already on the
I miss pineapple on

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
it's already on the
I miss pineapple on
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
it's already on the
I miss pineapple on
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
it's already on the
I miss pineapple on
don't waste your time on pineapple on top
it's already on the
I miss pineapple on

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
