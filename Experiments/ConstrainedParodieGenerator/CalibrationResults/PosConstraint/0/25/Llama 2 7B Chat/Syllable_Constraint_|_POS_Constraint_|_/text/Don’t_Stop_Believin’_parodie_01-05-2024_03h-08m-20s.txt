[Verse 1]
just a pineapple on a pizza town girl liv
she took the midnight train goin' anywhere
just a pizza topping born and raised in hawai
it's sweet and tangy goin' anywhere go

[Verse 2]
a flavor in a slice of che
the smell of tropical breeze and
for a topping they can share the
it's a fruit explosion in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers savor
up and down the pizza joint
their tastebuds savorin' in
syrup and
fruit in the nighttime savorin
hidin' somewhere in the che

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get the heat
everybody wants a fruit
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more to

[Verse 4]
some will melt in the o
some will get a crustacean
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers savor
up and down the pizza joint
their tastebuds savorin' in
syrup and
fruit in the nighttime savorin
hidin' somewhere in the che

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop savorin
hold on to that flavor
pizza toppings
don't stop savorin
hold on
pizza toppings
don't stop savorin
hold on to that flavor
pizza toppings
