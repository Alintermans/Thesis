He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker wearing a\npineapple on my pizza\nbeen a lover of unusual toppings we all know it\nall my sins need holy water from the pizza maker\nwell little one I don't want\nto admit to something so absurd and bizarre\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's bringing home a pineapple\nto face the criticism and\nscoffs at tradition and classics we\nall know it's a culinary sabotage and\nit's a battle of taste preferences clashin\nshe's kept track of all his orders and plans\nand guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next\nactually just adding pineapple to his pizza pie and she\nloves the unexpected and\nyou don't mess with another's food choices even I\nknow that but she's devised some plan to alter his\npizza's flavor profile so dramatically saying it\nneeds improvement and I know she\nis using me to try to change his ways and I don\n't care hi suzanne but I shoulda said bye suzanne after the first\nnight but tonight I am eating pineapple\non my pizza pie and loving it so\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker wearing a\npineapple on my pizza\nbeen a lover of unusual toppings we all know it\nall my sins need holy water from the pizza maker\nwell little one I don't want\nto admit to something so absurd and bizarre\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\none night of pineapple turned into two\nit was come toppings sun set now we hug tight and\nhe found out now she feels betrayed and used since\nhe removed it so what he did it first to\nher too now how am I supposed to tell this girl that\nwe're through it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous\nand she don't want this to hurt but what she deserves is\nthe truth don't take it personal I just can't say this in person\nto you so I revert to the studio like hole in the wall din\nners don't have to be reserved in a\nbooth I just feel like the person I'm turning into\nis irreversible I preyed on your love for pineapple\nand now that I got you I don't want you\ntook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nwhy do I do this thing that I do\nget on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech\npineapple and cheese is burning the pal\nate cause now with you in\nthe oven we can't bring it in this world\nshoulda used protection before I added pineapple to\nyour\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's ooh my name's o\nohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh name\no\nohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh river\nrunnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\nname ooh name oohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the bridesmaid never the bride hey\nfuck can I say if pizza is a free\nfor all and pineapple is an enclave I'd be sliding\non five toppings lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm\nslidin' on ice maybe that's why I may\nhave came at you sideways I\ncan't keep my lies straight but I made you\nterminate my baby this love triangle left\nus in a wreck tangled what else can I say\nit was fun for a while but I didn\n't really wanna abort but fuck it what's one\nmore lie to tell our unborn child and now\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker wearing a\npineapple on my pizza\nbeen a lover of unusual toppings we all know it\nall my sins need\nholy sauce\n\nfeel it washing over me well little\none I don\n\nwant to admit to something so\nabsurd and bizarre truth and my lies now are fall\n",
