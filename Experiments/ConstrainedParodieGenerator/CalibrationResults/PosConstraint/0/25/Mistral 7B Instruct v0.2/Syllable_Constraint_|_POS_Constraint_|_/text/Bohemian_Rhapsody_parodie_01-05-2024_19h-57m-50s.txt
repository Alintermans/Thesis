[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping frenzy with no escape from reality
open your eyes and gaze upon the pie's dec
I'm just a simple palate who needs no
sympathy for my disdain of this debate on pineapple
easy come and easy go with my love for cheese and tomato

[Verse 1]
papa just sliced a pine
placed it on a pizza pie then it began to whine and
papa pizza life had just
begun but now I've gone and ruined it
papa ooh did not mean to cause a stir
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late for my taste bud
sends shivers down my palate body's aching all the
time goodbye my friends I've
got to go gotta leave you all behind and
face the truth papa ooh any way
the wind blows I don't
wanna pine for pineapple on my pizza

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouette of a fruit
pineapple pete will you do the tiki dance tonight
thunderbolt and vinegar very tangy and sour
pineapple pie oh pineapple pie galore galore galore galore galore galore galore galore
but I'm just a simple palate nobody
loves me they all prefer their pizza plain and
spare me my life from this monstrosity
easy come easy go will you let me go
papa bismillah no we will not let
you go papa bismillah we will not let you
go papa bismillah we will not let you go
papa let me go papa let
me go papa let me go we
will not let you go we will not let you go we
will not let you go we will
not let you go we will not let you go we will not let you go
we will not let you go we will not let you go we will not let

[Verse 4]
so you think you can top me with a pineapple
so you think you can love me and leave me to pine
oh baby can't do this to me baby
just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]
