your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nI love you guys so much [/INST]\nParody:\n[Verse 1]\nI walked through the door with you under the bright\npineapple on the pizza seemed such a fright\nbut I left my palate pure at your brother\n's house and you've still got it in your fridge tonight\n\n[Verse 2]\noh pineapple's sweet disposition and my puzzled\ngaze we're arguing in the car about this\ntopping falling down like a debate in progress\nand I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I know it's long gone and\nthat harmony's not here no\nmore but I might be okay if I forget the\npineapple\n\n[Chorus]\n'cause there we are again on that little town street\nyou almost ordered wrong because you were looking at me with\ndisbelief in your eyes and\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\npineapple on the pizza in the kitchen light we're deb\nating the merits of this controversial choice of topping on a\npizza pie and your mother's shaking her head in disappro\nval and you told me about your past and your love for\npineapple on pizza and I was thinking about the taste\nand how it clashed with the tomato sauce and cheese\nand how it ruined the perfect harmony of the\npizza and I was longing for the simpler days of\npizza without pineapple on\n'em and then you wondered why it's so divisive\nand I tried to explain the\ncomplexity of flavor and texture but all I felt\nwas disappointment and you held my hand and tried to\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I know it's long gone and\nthere was nothing else I could do\nand I forget about the pineapple\nlong enough to forget why it\n\n[Chorus]\n'cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nwe're arguing about the merits of pineapple on a\npizza in the kitchen\nI remember it all too well\nand there we are again when nobody had to know\nyou kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o\nath of loyalty to\npineapple on pizza and we'd swear\n\n[Bridge]\nwell maybe we got lost in translation\nmaybe I asked for too much\nbut maybe this thing was a disaster\npineapple on a\npizza pie torn apart\nrunning scared I was there I was\nthere I remember it all too well and you call me up\nagain just to argue about the merits of pineapple\non a pizza pie so casually cruel\nin the name of being honest\n\n[Verse 4]\nthey say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell\nevery time you serve me pineapple\non a pizza you said if we had been more alike maybe it would\nhave been fine but that made me\nwant to scream and pineapple on a pizza\nis a never savory jewel whose flavor ruins the harmony\nof the dish not weeping in a rest\naurant bathroom some critic asking me\nwhat happened you that\nthat's what happened you you who charmed my dad with\nself deprecating jokes and sipping beer like you\nwere on a late night show but then he watched me watch the pizza go\nand he said it's supposed to be fun ordering pizza\n\n[Verse 5]\ntime won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it\nafter pepperoni days and nights when you made me\nyour own now you serve me pineapple and I walk\nhome alone but you keep my old favorite to\npping from that very first week it's a reminder of\ninnocence and it smells like\npizza I remember it all too\n\n[Chorus]\n'cause there we are again when I loved you so\nback before you ruined the one real thing you've ever\nknown it was rare I was\nthere I remember it all too\nwell wind in my hair you were\nthere you remember it\ndown the stairs you were there\nyou remember it all\nit was rare I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 6]\nand I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes\nI'll get older but your toppings stay the same\nfrom when your pepperoni broke my taste\nbuds and nights when you made me your own now you\nserve me pineapple and I'm a ske\nptic who's questioning the love affair did the to\npping maim you too or did the\nlove affair maim me too in this city\n's barren cold I still remember\nthe first slice of pizza I saw\n\n[Outro]\njust between us did the love affair maim you all too well\njust between us do you remember it all too well\njust between us I remember it all too well wind in my
