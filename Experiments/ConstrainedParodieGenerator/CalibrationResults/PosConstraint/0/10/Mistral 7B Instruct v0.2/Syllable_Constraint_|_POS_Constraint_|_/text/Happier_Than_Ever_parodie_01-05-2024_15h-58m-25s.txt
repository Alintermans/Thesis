[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our beloved pizza dish
I savor every bite with
an uncontrollable

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to ponder something amusing
to justify its absence
on my favorite pizza
do you taste it seasoned right
or do its flavors disagree
when you said it made improving
our culinary scene
I knew it wasn't meant to bemine I knew when
you added pineapple to our pie
you acted illogical and contradictory as could be seen
and I wish I could explain
could not come up with just one
reason why pineapple just doesn't belong on a
well peppered and savory one

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza dishi
savor every bite with an uncontrollable
wish I could explain it better ican't understand why you
insist on its inclusion

[Verse 2]
you claim it adds a tropical twist
creativeness to dishes that no
my taste buds can't abide your persistence
in our culinary shared space it
doesn't harmonize with the
meats and cheeses blended just right
for my perfect late night bitei
can't relate to those who

[Verse 3]
I won't slander your preference on the internet
never told anyone anything harsh
though it's not my favorite dish it's a matter
of personal taste and individual
so don't criticize the choices we
have made in our shared history
our combined dedication to a culinary art
but your adding pineapple just weakens our start
why can't you see it's a waste of our timeand don
ttry to make me feel bad for my opinion

[Outro]
you ruined culinary
delight with your misunderstood take
created a dish apart
just leave me alone with my authentic
pie
oh pine
oh
fade you
fade you
