[Intro]
is this a silly world filled with absurd fol
pizza topped with pineapple all unevenly rolled
take a bite looking for the taste of delight
but now I've gone and added pineapple in
pineapple lover please don't make me whineyboi right now
some say it's tasty others call it a faux pas to me to me

[Verse 1]
papa just altered a
placed a sliding pineapple on top does it really pair
papa sighs pizza heaven
but now it bears this unwanted ingred
scoffs mommy holds back her tears try not to
carry on carrying on as if nothing
really matters to the toppings on my pie tonight oh

[Verse 2]
too late my preference
sends shivers down my palate feelings out of order
denial bums me out being out of
gratefulness eateth all around gotta
holdfast keep an open mind try to
carry on carrying
on as if nothing really matters tonight

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see the little dispute before me che
peperone hates pineapple who woulda thunk it te
cherry tomato and prosciutto very filling me
mozzarella oh chef worthy I praise thee kudos irene irene irene irene magnificent irene
but I'm simply a traditional fellow
he's just a complex foodie from an open
heart I'll kindly ask you to consider
extra cheese or pepperoni will you let
me relinquish the pineapple from this
amalgamated creation may it rest peace
amalgamated our shared enjoyment it
is what makes loving pizza feel
can't do this to me baby
just gotta get out just gotta get right outside
no no no a thousand times
no no no a thousand times today oh mamma mia let me
serve be a hostess giving only that I crave I crave I we

[Verse 4]
so your palate thinks pineapple won't blend well
why my tastebuds long for a savory spell
baby please don't do this to my beloved
just gotta take a bite must broaden my horizont

[Outro]
oh
oh yeah oh yeah
nothing really tastes the same to me tonight
nothing really matters
nothing really matters to me
any winey any
