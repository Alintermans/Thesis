[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pinefor you ire

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the taste that ruins pizza
a paradox in every pie with
an unexpected presence
with tartness on the inside
we can live without romance and silly if
we want no pineapple on
and our loved dishes harmonize
and in the night our hatred never
our hatred never

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pinefor you ire
I pinefor you ire

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where have you gone ireful one
I have no peace my palate's missing
your sweet savor irelessly
this tropical aff
comes creeping on with ireless aversion
and as I'm served ideded
the contrast of the ions
are bittersweet and disrupt our
harmony forever to be
will you remove this pine from
remove this pine from me tonight tonight
remove this pine from

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't risk it taste on me irelessly
the enemy inside
I pinefor you ire
don't taste it waste on me irelessly
the memory behind
I pinefor you ire

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't taste it waste on me irelessly
the texture inside me
I pinefor you ire
don't risk it taste on me irelessly
the texture inside me
I pinefor you ire
don't taste it waste on me irelessly
the texture inside me
I pinefor you ire
don't taste it waste on me irelessly
the sensation inside
I pinefor you ire

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pinefor you ire
I pinefor you ire
I pinefor you ire
I pinefor your taste
