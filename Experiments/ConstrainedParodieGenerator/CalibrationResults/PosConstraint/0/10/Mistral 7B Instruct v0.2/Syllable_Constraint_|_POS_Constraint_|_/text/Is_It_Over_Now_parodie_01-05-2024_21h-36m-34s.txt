[Intro]
is it pineapple off a pizza gone

[Verse 1]
once the peace had been broken
with the bite of the pineapple
my beloved dish forsaken
our taste tested

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand pizzas later again
your toppings I've seen them on unsuspecting men and women
you yearn for my cheese with its savory flavor a traitor
your searching through an oven to find that perfect combination

[Chorus]
was it over where the pepperoni lay
was it over once the mushrooms came your way
please just come closer in my dream
while you gasp in disbelief saying
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it icing our

[Verse 2]
when we lost harmony tone
green juice black tomato
stuck on this circular boat
it's a pineapple clone

[Bridge]
did you think that I didn't see you
another helping
at least I tried to order mine
to stay myself concealed from
the rumors of my peppery and
and my frustrated
oh sweet heavens thinking about
overturning tables just
to see you come correcting
but no that's not my calling save me from this

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand silly debates later once
if your loved one's name is pineapple I'll surmise you'll eventually
you yearn for my cheese with its savory flavor another trait
your searching through a menu to find that pleasing combination

[Chorus]
was it over where the pepperoni lay
was it over once the mushrooms came your way
please only come closer in your
while you state in disbelief saying
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
yes it
is it aging our
repeat
do you notice

[Bridge]
did I ignore you see
another helping
at least I tried to order mine
to stay myself concealer
of the rumors of my peppery
and my frustrated
oh dear heavens thinking about
overturning tables just
to see you come correcting error
but no that's not my calling save me from this

[Outro]
tables to errors night
let's fast forwarding to a thousand takeout pizzas later
and say the one thing that I've been wanting
but no that's not the answer
is it aging our
repeat
let's fast forwarding to a thousand arguments
