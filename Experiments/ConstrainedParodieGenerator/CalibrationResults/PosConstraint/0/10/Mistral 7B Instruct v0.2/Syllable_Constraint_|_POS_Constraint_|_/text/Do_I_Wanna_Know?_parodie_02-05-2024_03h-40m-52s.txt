[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple in
do you ever fear that dining's akin to a sinful
an unwelcome guest in every bite
are there some reasons it shouldn't
have you no inkling of its supposed in
my dreams haunt me every night this weeklong spree of
why it's placed upon a pizza
'cause there's this notion we
all agree it doesn't belong decree it's an anomie
on our repeated quest for satisfaction

[Pre-Chorus]
do we dare explore this culinary debate
bitterweetness to end our ongoing plateaus
that the nights were made for savory creations
of expressin'views we hesitate to state come soon

[Chorus]
drinking back to you
ever thought of dialing
when you've had a
since I always
just averse to
craving tradition
to favor that aroma
now I acknowledge
drinking back to you

[Verse 2]
have you the courage to
admit acceptance of the pineapple
and if so my amicable proposal
prepare to allay objections kindly under control
I strive not to intrude yet perseverant in desire
but your hedged response won't quench my underlying
but our shared amity could never tire

[Pre-Chorus]
do we dare explore this culinary debate
bitterweetness to end our ongoing plateaus
that the nights were made for savory creations
of expressin'views we hesitate to state come soon

[Chorus]
partaking back to you partaking back
ever envisioned dial
when you've had a craving part
since I always hold devotedly
justly averse to innovation yet
craving tradition to favor
to honor that aroma
nevertheless we
party back to you

[Outro]
do we dare explore this culinary debate
endpoints of ingrained longstanding tastes to fade away
that the nights were made for savory creations
that we'd share in our continuing debate come
do we dare explore this culinary debate fare
ever envisioned partaking callin' daringly
do you wantme partakin' back to pineapple tradition
