[Verse 1]
don't put pineapple on
it doesn't belong on a pie
it'll ruin the flavor of the che
oh no I please explain why ye

[Pre-Chorus]
won't you listen to my ple
won't you hear me out loud clear
won't you understand my fear
won't you put it on

[Chorus]
pineapple doesn't belong on a
pineapple doesn't belong on
pineapple doesn't belong on
pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza that's so wrong manners
a combination we can't

[Post-Chorus]
no way man

[Verse 2]
the sweetness clashes with the
the savory flavors of
the spices and the meat and the che
oh no it's just not meant to be

[Pre-Chorus]
won't you listen to my ple
won't you hear me out loud clear
won't you understand my fear
won't you put it on

[Chorus]
pineapple doesn't belong on a
pineapple doesn't belong on
pineapple doesn't belong on
pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza that's so wrong manners
a combination we can't

[Post-Chorus]
no way man

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]

[Pre-Chorus]

won't you hear me out loud clear
won't you understand my fear
won't you put it on

[Chorus]
pineapple doesn't belong on a
pineapple doesn't belong on
pineapple doesn't belong on
pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza that's so wrong manners
a combination we can't

a denial the pineapple
a denial a decision
a denial
