And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\npineapple on a pie\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\ndon't put\nit on a pizza please god\nthe cheese and sauce aren't enough for me\nit's a fruit that belongs in\nsummer salads and smoothies\nnot on a pie that's meant to be shared with friends\nand family at the end\nof the night we'll all agree that it\njust doesn't belong on a pizza that\nits flavor is too strong\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\npineapple on a pie\npineapple on a pie\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nhow could you even consider\nits sweetness overpowering the rest of\nthe toppings on the pizza and\nevery single\nbite will be overwhelming and confusing\nand by the end of the me\nwe'll all agree that it was\na pineapple pizza disaster\nthat nobody asked for or wants\nplease don't put pineapple\non a pizza it's just not worth it man\nits flavor profile\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nsave the pineapple for something else you see\nthis pizza is perfect\njust the way it is don\n\nsave the pineapple for something else you see\nthis pizza is perfect\njust the way it is don\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nsave the pineapple for something else you see\nthis pizza is perfect\njust the way it is don\n\nsaving the pineapple for something else you\nsee this pizza is what\nit was meant to be sav\n\nsaving the pineapple for something else you\nsee this pizza is what\nit was meant to be sav\n\nsaving the pineapple for something else you\nsee this pizza is what\nit was meant to be sav\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\npineapple on a pie\npineapple on a pie\nits been our pleasure\n",
