[Intro]
don'cha know pineapple doesn't belong on a

[Verse 1]
don't even
plantain on top of pepper
it's like a flavorful offense any way
how could you even consider
fingerprints on
so sue me if I don't ad
on my pizza there will be
no pineapple ring no pineapple ring

[Chorus]
in this world of toppings
you must heed this rule of orderings
in this world of toppings
you must heed this rule of orderings
no pineapple allowed
its got its own island

[Verse 2]
can't someone
insert my opinion here
why can't y'all see that pineapple goes
it steals the show gives me a
reason to no
but spicy takes the cake gives me
heat of the moment gives me
what more could I ask for what more could I ask

[Chorus]
in this world of toppings
you must heed this rule of orderings
in this world of toppings
you must heed this rule of orderings
no pineapple allowed
its got its own island

[Bridge]
step away step away let it go step
your pineapple obsession has got to go before
others get upset let it go before
my pizza gets eaten let it go before it get

[Outro]
don
in this world
my pizza my choice my voice my to
in this world of toppings
