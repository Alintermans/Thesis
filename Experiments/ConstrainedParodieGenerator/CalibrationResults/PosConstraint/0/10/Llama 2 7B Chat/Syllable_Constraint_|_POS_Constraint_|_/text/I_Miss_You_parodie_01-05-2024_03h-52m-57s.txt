[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple on a pie

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
don't put
it on a pizza please god
the cheese and sauce aren't enough for me
it's a fruit that belongs in
summer salads and smoothies
not on a pie that's meant to be shared with friends
and family at the end
of the night we'll all agree that it
just doesn't belong on a pizza that
its flavor is too strong

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple on a pie
pineapple on a pie

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
how could you even consider
its sweetness overpowering the rest of
the toppings on the pizza and
every single
bite will be overwhelming and confusing
and by the end of the me
we'll all agree that it was
a pineapple pizza disaster
that nobody asked for or wants
please don't put pineapple
on a pizza it's just not worth it man
its flavor profile

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
save the pineapple for something else you see
this pizza is perfect
just the way it is don
save the pineapple for something else you see
this pizza is perfect
just the way it is don

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
save the pineapple for something else you see
this pizza is perfect
just the way it is don
saving the pineapple for something else you
see this pizza is what
it was meant to be sav
saving the pineapple for something else you
see this pizza is what
it was meant to be sav
saving the pineapple for something else you
see this pizza is what
it was meant to be sav

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple on a pie
pineapple on a pie
its been our pleasure
to dine with you tonight
