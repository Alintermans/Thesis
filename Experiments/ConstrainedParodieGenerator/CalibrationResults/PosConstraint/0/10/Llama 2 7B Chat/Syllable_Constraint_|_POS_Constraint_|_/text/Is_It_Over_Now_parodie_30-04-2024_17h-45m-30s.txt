[Intro]
is pineapple on a pizza really

[Verse 1]
once I bit into a slice
with a taste of paradise gone
my eyes glazed over in dis
what was I thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hours of indigestion now
its supposed to be cheese and pepperoni of course somehow
you insisted on tropical bliss on top of our pie
its gotta be questionable up there in the heavens above

[Chorus]
are pineapple and pizza really meant to
are they a match made in culinary hell
I never thought id see the day
where I'd have to question my taste bud
is it over now that ive given in to

[Post-Chorus]
uh huh is it really

[Verse 2]
ohana my ohana
such a poor decision
yellow and red just don't
belong on the same pie

[Bridge]
and I thought you knew me better than
the flavors just don
overpower the sauce and che
to think you'd do this to me
on a night we were supposed to be
cozy and nice and
peaceful and quiet in our
underpants by the fire
just the two of us alone
but instead we're here with a pineapple on

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hours of indigestion tonight
with a pineapple on top of our pizza might as well have been a
we insisted on tropical bliss on top of our pie could
it gets any more questionable up there in the heavensbove

[Chorus]
was it over when we added pineapple
was it over when we decided to be
reckless and irresponsible
in the kitchen with our taste bud
are they a match made in culinary hell

[Post-Chorus]
uh hu
is it really over
isan
please notethat

[Bridge]
thinking our love would
stand the test of time
for more than just a measuring
of how much pineapple we
can fit on a pizza at one time
but alas it seems
our relationship is do
without without even a
chance of surviving this pineapple
on pizza fiasco we call a date night

[Outro]
uh huh is it really
is it really over now that weve added pineapple to
our beloved pizza its a question
of how much more we can take
its gotta be question
question
questionable up there in the heavens above
