[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I wish I coulda told you no
about the pineapple on
that we shouldn't put it on a pizza at all you know it
now we're in this mess and I can't ignore it any
if only we could turn back time
don't you see it just doesn't belong on a
well ain't nobody

[Verse 1: Eminem]
it seems like just yesterday we were cookin
upside zero pepperoni
like it was to infinity and
but now we got a new problem on our hands
our credibility's takin' a hit like
what happened to the classic margherite
or simple cheese just can't believe we're in this predic
double when did we start caterin' to the masses you see it just
ain't natural and it
ain't right and it ain't pineapple on a pizza
it's like putting kale on a cheeseburger it just
plain ain't gonna fly you see it's a tradition like
putting jelly on a hot dog
gotta stick to the basics baby don't be a
rebel without a cause you see it's gotta be traditional
plain and simple it's the only way to go
if we wanna save our pizza game

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I wish I coulda told you no
about the pineapple on
that we shouldn't put it on a pizza at all you know it
now we're in this mess and I can't ignore it any
if only we could turn back time
don't you see it just doesn't belong on a
well ain't nobody

[Verse 2: Eminem]
some say pineapple's a tropical sight
but that don't make it right on a pizza ton
it sets my teeth on edge just thinking about
it's like a crime against humanity and
just more proof of the decline of society and
our moral compass gone awry and everything
been corrupted by the almighty dollar sign you see
it's like we've lost our way and can't find our way back to the light
it's a sad day when we can't even agree on a simple thing
can't put aside our petty squ
it's gotta be pineapple or pepperoni you
can't please everyone you see it's just common sense baby
but now we're caught in a battle of wills and
words don't even begin to describe
how wrong it is to put pineapple
on a pizza so wrong that it ain't even
plain and simple it don't belong and
just can't abide it
our credibility's taken a hit
ain't nobody gonna make me like it nobody ain
ton

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I wish I coulda told you no
about the pineapple on
that we shouldn't put it on a pizza at all you know it
now we're in this mess and I can't ignore it any
if only we could turn back time
don't you see it just doesn't belong on a
well ain't nobody

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
we warned you people we
time moves
rap
fastward to
now we're paying the price
not adhering to the rules of the

[Verse 3: Eminem]
since when did pineapple become the norm
wish we could go back to the old ways and
keep it real and keep it genuine you see it's time to
throw out the pineapple and get back to the basics
no more experimentation just keep
it simple just like our
and our forefathers intended it
ain't nothing better than a classic margher
or pepperoni on a pizza you see
aint nobody gonna tell me none
pineapple don't belong on a pizza
my willpower's stronger than your marketing

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I wish I coulda told you no
about the pineapple on
that we shouldn't put it on a pizza at all you know it
now we're in this
mess and I
my apologies for the confusion
my will to
resist the urge to compromise
the fate of our pizza tradition depends
on standing strong and stay
