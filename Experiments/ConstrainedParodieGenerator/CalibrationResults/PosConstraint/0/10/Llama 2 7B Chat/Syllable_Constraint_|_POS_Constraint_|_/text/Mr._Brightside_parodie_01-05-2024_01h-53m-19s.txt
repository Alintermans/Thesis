[Verse]
step away from the pineapple on my pizza pie
ain't no reason why it should be in the air
it started out with some cheese and pepperoni too see
how did it end up with a tropical fruit bre
now my taste buds are in disarray and I can
that's no way to make a margherita my dear
just give me mozzarella and some sausage and
but pineapple on a

[Pre-Chorus]
but she keeps touchin' it with
he takes a bite without
let it go
'cause it's just too much for me seein' her with it
and taking control

[Chorus]
people judge me when I say no to the
strange toppings on my pizza
sweden to sicily they
just can't seem to agree
destruction is callins me
can't you see I just want
my pizza the way
