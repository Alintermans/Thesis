And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nmy beloved pizzapi\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nsorrystate\nan island among me me\nthe cheese in a conspiracy against\nevery single flavor\nthat gather by an apple\nour shared canned pear despair if we want it\nwhy your faces nearby do\nand our shared hatred knowsnobound\nbut on a simplepieceeze he sitsand\nhis unwelcomepres\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nmy believesipped\nmy missing you our\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nalone amedited I and\nmy closed long evening our shared ely\nmy be desirebutonand\neach other timeas\nyummy tendrisreach with for amoving this\nand over their can our\nall taste that a that dreaddel\nmay share but might it time nightstand till\nuntil dayafterwithinyoustep\nbut try us today inside\ncomes your will power but can all resides\ncould all sidesres\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nletting ago lose you waste with he our\nthat flavorvoice behind\nour missing our\n\nletting ago thrownremove us apple that\nno pizza off he part\nour will our we\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ncan not create we ours inside who what\nany side on you food\nyou save it our lost\n\nshallowededgedingrediedineded\nthis change without him share\nwhat hidden his our\n\nkeep far removed them puretime before us\nno pizza between you\nour desired it\n\nlet alone flowoursharedour he night with\nno tangyaliveringle\nus freshwill ourself\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nmy desired it you\nour sacred our\nme missingyourloveour\n",
