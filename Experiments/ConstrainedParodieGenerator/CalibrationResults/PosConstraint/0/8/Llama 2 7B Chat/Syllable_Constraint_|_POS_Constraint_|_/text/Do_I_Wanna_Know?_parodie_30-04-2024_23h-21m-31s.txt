[Verse 1]
have you got a taste for something
that's not on a pizza plate oh no not pineapple on
a topping that's just plain wrong you know I

no pineapple on my pizza please oh no not

know that pineapple doesn't belong on a pizza
sad to see you go with that topping oh no not

ever thought of takin' it
