[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the recipes and the
pineapple on a slice
it doesn't belong on
a pizza at all
hercules and his meat
achilles and his feet no pineapple on a pie

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go eatery
how much you want to che
I'm not looking for something sweet
with a topping so neatly
some fairytale treat
just something that's neat
I want something savory
not something so sweet and
sweet and sour and spicy

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh no pineapple on
oh no pineapple
oh no pineapple on
a pizza at all no no no
oh no pineapple on
I want something sav
not something so sweet and
sweet and sour and spicy no
no pineapple on my pie

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the history of food
the evolution of
toppings on a pizza
but pineapple is not
a pizza at all no
hercules and his meat no pineapple on

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go eatery
how much you want to che
I'm not looking for something sweet
with a topping so neatly
some fairytale treat
just something that's neat
I want something savory
not something so sweet and

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh no pineapple on a
oh no pineapple on a

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something savory
not something so sweet and
sweet and sour and
spicy no pineapple
on my pizza please no no no
oh I want something sav
not something so sweet
and sour and spicy

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to che
I'm not looking for something sweet
with a topping so neatly
some fairytale treat
just something that's neat
I want something savory
not something so sweet and
sweet and sour and spicy

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh no pineapple on a pie
oh no pineapple on a pie
oh no pineapple on a pie
