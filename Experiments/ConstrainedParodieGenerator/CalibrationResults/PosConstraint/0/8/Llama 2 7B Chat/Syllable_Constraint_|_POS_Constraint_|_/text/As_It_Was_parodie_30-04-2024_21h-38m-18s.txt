[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza should not be seen ton

[Verse 1]
tastes so sweet but
don't belong on a pie
it's like a fruit salad in disguise but it
just doesn't fit in the sky high
can't ignore
the toppings we adore but it
ain't no pineapple in
the pizza shop anymore oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this pizza world it
ain't the same as it was before
in this pizza world it
ain't the same as it was before
as it was before oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
juicy and sweet
but it don't belong on
a pie that's what we all agree on see
it's like a tropical dream
but it don't
belong on a pizza machine
we don't want no pineapp
on our pizza scene oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this pizza world it
ain't the same as it was before
in this pizza world it
ain't the same as it was before
as it was before oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Bridge]
go back to the old days when pizza was
just cheese and sauce and pepperoni in disguise but
now it's all about the toppings we choose
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was

[Outro]
pine
ain't the
same as it was before oh oh oh
as it was before oh
