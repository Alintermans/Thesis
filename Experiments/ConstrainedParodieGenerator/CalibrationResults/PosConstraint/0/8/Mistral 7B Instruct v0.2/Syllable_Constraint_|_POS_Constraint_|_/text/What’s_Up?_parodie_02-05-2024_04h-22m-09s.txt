[Verse 1]
twenty five years with pizza
trying to top that great big pie of delight
for a combination
I realized quickly when I took a bite
that the kitchen was made up of this brotherhood of
toppings for whatever

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying on the
couch just to get it all out what's in mind
and I weary in the morning and I step to
the fridge and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I protest from the top of my lungs clear
as a bell through the kitchen air with
a fervent ple

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
I said hey
what's this pineapple on my pie
heyeyey heyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey
what's this pineapple on my pie

[Bridge]
ooh o

ooh uh hum
ooh o
o
ooh uh hum

[Verse 2]
and I pine
oh my goodness do we
we pine all the time
in this culinary
and we dream
oh my goodness do we
we dream every single day
for innovation

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying on the
couch just to get it all out what's in mind
and I weary in the morning and I step to
the fridge and I take a deep breath and I get real high
and I protest from the top of my lungs clear
as a bell through the kitchen air with
a fervent ple

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
I said hey
what's this pineapple on the
heyeyey heyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey
what's this pineapple on the pie
heyeyey heyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey oh no no no no no
what's this pine
apple on the pie heyeyey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey
what's this pineapple on the pie
heyeyey heyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey oh no no no no no
what's this pineapple
on the pie heyeyey heyeyey hey hey heyeyey hey
I said hey
what's this pineapple on the pie

[Bridge]
ooh o

[Outro]
twenty five years with pizza
trying to top that great big pie of delight
for a combination oh
