[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the pie
seas of cheese would rise when I gave
now in the morning I eat alone
sweep the table I used to

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
feel the disdain in the pineapple
listen as the crowd would sigh
now the old king is pineapple free now
one minute it was on the
next it ruined all the flav
and I discovered that my pizza stands
on toppings of controversy and disdain

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear criticism bells a ringin
pizza purists voices singin'why
be my mirror reflecting truth
my peace of mind in turmoil stewedfor
some reason I can't explainwhy
pineapple on a pizza
never an honest taste
but that was when I ruled the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild choice
blew down the harmony to let
shattered palates and the sound of gro
ans people couldn't believe my folly
pineapple revolution
on a savory plate await
just a puzzle on a lonely platteraw
who would ever wanna be the one

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear criticism bells a ringin
pizza purists voices singin'why
be my mirror reflecting truth
my peace of mind in turmoil stewedfor
some reason I can't explainwhy
pineapple on a pizza will never
never an honest taste
but that was when I ruled the pie
