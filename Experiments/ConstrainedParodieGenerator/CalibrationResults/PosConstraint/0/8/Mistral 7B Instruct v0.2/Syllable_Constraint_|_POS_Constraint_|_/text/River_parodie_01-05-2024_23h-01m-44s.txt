I've been a liar serving a

been a lover of tradition and a hater of the new
all my palates need cleansing water crying out for the
classics to come through again and
little one I don't want to admit to this
if it's gonna cause a

[Verse 1: Eminem]
it's a food fight in the kitchen heated up
pepperoni vs pineap
leaves us all confused and upsetting
the balance of flavors we've built up and plotted
it's a battle of the toppings on our plates
some say it's a mistake but I hate to
admit that I've succumbed to the pineapple's allure and
now my pizza's no longer pure and authenticity's in ruins
it's a recipe for a
disaster and you don't want to be a part of this
but she's got a passion for the pineapple's taste
and she's got a plan to change our ways and defy the
tradition we've held for ages
'cause she loves the unexpected twists and turns and you don
't mess with a foodie's heart's desires and passions and dreams and fears
but she's devised some scheme to add pineapple
to our favorite dish and I can

[Verse 2: Eminem]
once upon a time it was simple and
delicious a perfect combination of sauce
and cheese and pepperoni but now it's all
complicated with the addition of pine
apple and I'm struggling to find the words to tell
her that it's not working out and I'm feeling nervous
and unsure and I don't want to hurt her feelings but
the truth is the pineapple doesn't belong and I know it's true and now
that I've tasted the pineapple on our pizza I can't go
back to the way it was before and now
our relationship's on the rocks and it feels like
we're drifting apart and it's all because of the pineapple
and now I'm in the kitchen trying to make
amends and I'm thinking of removing
the pineapple from our pizza
but it's hard to find the courage to tell her the
truth and face the consequences of this
pineapple debacle
so I turn to the studio like a sanct

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the trendsetter never the one
to follow the crowd in the kitchen or
elsewhere but now I'm questioning my choices and my stance
on pineapple on pizza and I'm wondering if
I've been wrong all along and maybe it
's time to try something new and
embrace the pineapple's place in our
culinary world but then I remember the
traditions we've held for generations and
the purity of the classic flav
ors and I can't bring myself to accept
this pineapple invasion and the way it
