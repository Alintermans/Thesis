[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it felt like a mistake
and I left my pizza there with pineapple
and you've still got it in your fridge now looking

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet disposition and my puzzled gaze coll
we're arguing in the kitchen about this
pineapple on a pizza pie falls apart like
and I can picture it after all these nights

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little kitchen
floor you almost choked on your slice because you were grimacing
pineapple in your hair it
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter you were turning red with rage
you used to be a cheese lover in a pepperoni bed alone
and your mom's telling stories about you on the pizza team
you told me about your past thinking pineapple was
the key to your heart and you were tossing me the knife saying
pineapple on the floor we were always changing
and I was thinking on the drive home any minute
he's gonna say it's a disaster you never called it
'til we were dead and gone and buried
check the texture and come back swearing it's the
same after three months in the
grave and then you wondered where it went to as I reached for
you but all I felt was disappointment and you held

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
pineapple in my hair
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like a curse
pineapple prayer and we
swore to remember it all too well

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you ruined it all
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to disappoint me like a
promise broken in the name of being honest and true to
yourself and I'm a crumpled up piece of paper
lying here because I can't

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you add pineapple to
my pizza pie you said if we had been closer in taste maybe it
would have been fine and that made
me want to die the idea you had of
me who was I a never satisfied pineapple lover whose hunger
reflected on you not weeping in
a party bathroom some guest asking me
what happened you pine
that's what happened you pineapple lover you
you who charmed my dad with self deprecating jokes
sipping beer like you're on a late night show but then he watched me watch
the oven door all night willing you to take it away

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
but you keep my old pizza from that very first
week because it reminds you of innocence and it
smells like me you can't get
rid of it because you remember

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I hated you
back before you added pineapple to my pizza
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
pineapple in my hair you
remember it all pine
apple in my hair you
remember it all pine
apple in my hair you
remember it all too well pine

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pizzas stay the same
from when your pepperoni broke my skin
and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half
my appetite did the pineapple
bruise paint you blue just between us did the love aff
air maim you too because in
this city's barren cold I still remem
ber the first fall of snow and how
it glistened as it fell I rem

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well pineapple in
my hair I was there pineapple in the
kitchen I was there pineapple in
my hair I was there pineapple in
the kitchen I was there pineapple in the
kitchen I was there pineapple in the
kitchen I was there pineapple in
the kitchen I was there pineapple
in the kitchen I was there pine
apple in the kitchen I was there pine
apple in the kitchen I was there
pineapple in the kitchen I was
there pineapple in the kitchen
I was there pineapple in the kitchen
I was there pineapple in the kit
chen I was there pineapple in the
kitchen I was there pineapple in the kit

[Spoken Outro]
