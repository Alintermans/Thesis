[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping frenzy with no escape from reality
open your eyeswide seeing a pineapple
I'm just a poor chef I need no sympathy
because I'm easy bake easy take little high little low
any way the sauce flows doesn't really matter to me to me

[Verse 1]
papa just ordered a
pineapple on top of his pizza pie put it there and
papa pizza life had just
begun but now I've gone and ruined it
papa ooh didn't mean to make you sigh
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my creation
sends shivers down my spine pizza aching all the time
goodbye everybody I've got to go
gonna leave you all behind and face the truth
papa ooh any way the sauce flows
I don't wanna spo
il I sometimes wish I'd never added pine

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouette of a dish
pepperoni man pepperoni man will you do
the garnish dance pepperoni man pepperoni man
vine ripened tomatoes and melted cheese so frightening me pepperoni pepperoni pepperoni
but I'm just a poor chef nobody loves me
he's just a poor chef from a humble kitchen
spare him his recipe from this monstros
ity spare him his recipe from this mon
strosity easy bake easy take will
you let me go bismillah we will not let you
go bismillah we will not let you go bismill
ah we will not let you go we
will not let you go never let
you go mamma mia let me go mamma ma
mia let me go mamma
mia let me go mamma mia let me go mamma mia
bismillah we will not let you go we will not let you go we

[Verse 4]
so you think you can top me with a pineapple
so you think you can love me and leave me to fail
oh baby can't do this to me baby
just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]
o
oh yeah oh yeah
nothing really matters anyone can see
nothing really matters
nothing really matters to me
any way the sauce flows
