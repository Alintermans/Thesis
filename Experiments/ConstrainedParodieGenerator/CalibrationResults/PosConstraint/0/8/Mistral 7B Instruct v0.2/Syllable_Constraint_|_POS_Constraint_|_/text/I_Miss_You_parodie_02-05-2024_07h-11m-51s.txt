[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pineapple on my pie
the unwelcome guest at dinner's table
the unexpected twist in
our culinary tale
we can live like friends if we want it so keen
where you can always find me
and we'll have harmony on pizza
but in the night we'll wish this never be
we'll wish this never be

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the harmony and love
I cannot taste my pizza tonight with
this unwelcome fruit invading
the flavors I ad
d and as I savor every bite rec
all the memories of past
delights that once delighted
my taste buds and satisfied my pal
ate but now are replaced by this
pineapple's intrusion and
its sweet and savory betrayal will
betrayal will not

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside your
topping choices I dread
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside your
topping choices I dread

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside your
topping choices I dread
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside your
topping choices I dread
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside your
topping choices I dread
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the flavor inside your
topping choices I dread

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
