[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a pizza topping that was sound
but now I see the error ofmy
pineapple on a pizza
you agree

[Verse]
I've ordered two pies with pineap
please don't pretend it's gourmet appealin' to all pal
oh pizza world what have we done here
if I could ban it from menus far and near
some like it hot some like it mild
but you'd have thought that I would compromise and be reconc
iled but burnt taste buds break the deal so
pineapple lovers let it go and let me be the solo

[Chorus]
let it go let it
go let it go let
it go let it go let it
go let it go let
go let it go let it go
go let it go let

[Outro]
let it go let it
go let it go let it
go let it go let it
go let it go let it go go
let it
