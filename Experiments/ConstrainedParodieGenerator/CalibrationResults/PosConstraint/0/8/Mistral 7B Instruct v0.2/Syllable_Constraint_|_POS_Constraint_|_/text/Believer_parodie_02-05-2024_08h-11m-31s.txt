[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
a taste that just won't persist

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you argue with me about this trendy
topping on my pizza
I'm the one who's picky and cheesy
my palate's the pizza king

[Pre-Chorus]
I was served a slice with surprise
pineapple on top was a disgu
sweet and savory or so they
say but to me it's a pity party for my taste
but I'll fight for my preference
make my case with every bite
using my fork as my defense
and my palate as my delight

[Chorus]
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in my own
pain of pineapple breaks me down then
believer in my own
pain of pineapple let the debate begin
my tastebuds' love came from within
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in my own

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the culinary
heavens above for the
pizza purists who've heard the outrageous
pineapple debate rages on

[Pre-Chorus]
we were divided in the
kitchens of our homes and hearts
pineapple lovers and haters
fighting for the ultimate part
but we never agreed on the matter of tasteful
combinations on our pizzas' canvas and plateful
it's a canvas

[Chorus]
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in my own
pain of pineapple breaks me down then
believer in my own
pain of pineapple let the debate begin
my tastebuds' love came from within
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in my own

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the oven and the dough
you're the face of the pizza
the sauce in my bowl holds the
power to bring us all back

[Pre-Chorus]
but we never agreed on the matter of tasteful
combinations on our pizzas' canvas and plateful
it's a canvas

[Chorus]
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in my own
pain of pineapple breaks me down then
believer in my own
pain of pineapple let the debate begin
my tastebuds' love came from within
pain of pineapple on my pizza
believer in my own
