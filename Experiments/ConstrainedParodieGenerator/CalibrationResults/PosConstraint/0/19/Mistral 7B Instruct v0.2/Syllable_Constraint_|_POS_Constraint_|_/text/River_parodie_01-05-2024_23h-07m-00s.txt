[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need holy water from the pizza maker
well little one I don't want
to admit to something so absurd and bizarre
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's bringing home a pineapple
to face the criticism and
pineapple on his pizza plate is
mismatched with the traditional spaghetti and
it's a battle of taste buds clashin'
she just wants to exact revenge and rel
pineapple on his pizza is a crime she's detected
'cause she loves tradition and balance and respect it is a testament
it's a chess match of flavors
she's kept track of all the pizza orders past and present
and guess who just happens to be orderin' a
pineapple pizza tonight and she has what my palate
lacks craving for the familiar
but she's devised some plan to sabotage his taste bud
knife in hand says our relationship's hangin' by a strand so
she's been on the web lately searching for a
pineapple hater to join her in her

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need holy water from the pizza maker
well little one I don't want
to admit to something so absurd and bizarre
truth and my lies now are

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one bite stand turned a two bite stand
it was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and then
he found out now she feels deserted and used
'cause he left so what he did it first to her too
now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and true
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners don
t have to be reserved in a booth but
I just feel like the person I'm turning into's irre
versible I preyed on you like it's pizza at the pew and now
that I got you I don't want you taking
advantage in my thirst to pursue but
why do I do this dirt that I do
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'cause now with her in the wom
we can't bring her in this world shoulda knew
to use protection before I bit into your forbidden
top

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need holy water from the pizza maker
well little one I don't want
to admit to something so absurd and bizarre
truth and my lies now are

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
my name's ooh my name's o

ooh we'll let the
pizza run call me ooh call me o

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can I say if pizza was a free
way and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in five
pizza pies speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin' on
ice maybe that's why I may have came at
you sideways I can't keep
my lies straight but I made you terminate
my baby this love triangle left us in a
wreck tangled what else can I say it was fun
for a while but I really woulda
loved your smile didn't really wanna abort
but what's one more lie to tell our unborn

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a joker wearing a
pineapple on my pizza
been a lover of unusual toppings we all know it
all my sins need
holy sauce
from the pizza maker well little one
I'm sorry
I don't want to admit to
something so absurd and bizarre truth and my lies
now are falling like the
