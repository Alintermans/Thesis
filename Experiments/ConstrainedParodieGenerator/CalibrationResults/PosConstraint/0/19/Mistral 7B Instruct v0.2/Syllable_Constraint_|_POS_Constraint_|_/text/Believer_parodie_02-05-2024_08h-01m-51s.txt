[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
a taste that just won't persist

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you argue with me about this trendy
topping on my pizza
I'm the one who orders tradition
the way it's meant to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on margherita
cheese and sauce were my priority
pepperoni and olives too
but pineapple ruined it for me and youoooohhhhh singin
savoring memories from the
pizza past that we used to know
enjoying the taste as it grows
painting a picture of the old

[Chorus]
painapple pie made me a hater
hater hater hater
painapple pie broke my trust so deep it
hater hater hater
painapple pie let the controversy rain down
my love for pizza it came from the
painapple pie made me a haterhate
hater hater hater

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the pizza gods up
keep the pineapple off
we've all heard the complaints enough ohoh
our love for pizza is off

[Pre-Chorus]
we were enjoying our
margherita and pepperon
but then came the pineapple intr
disrupting our harmony
we tried to ignore it but it lingered on and on
but we couldn't escape the taste that was strong and on and on
it lingered on

[Chorus]
painapple pie made me a hater
hater hater hater
painapple pie broke my trust so deep it
hater hater hater
painapple pie let the controversy rain down
my love for pizza it came from the
painapple pie made me a haterhate
hater hater hater

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the oven and the cheese
keep the pineapple at bay
it's the taste of our past
the taste of our pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
we were savouring our memories of pizza
margherita and pepperoni and olive delightful
but then came the

[Chorus]
painapple pie made me a hater
hater hater hater
painapple pie broke my trust so deep it
hater hater hater
painapple pie let the controversy rain down
my love for pizza it came from the
painapple pie made me a haterhate
hater hater hater
