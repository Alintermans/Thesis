my lover's got a qu
she's the pineapple at the table
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've ordered pizza sans
if the menu ever did speak
pineapple's the last true
every sunday's gettin' more bland
a fresh controversy
we were born opposed to this topping
my kitchen offers no respite
she tells me change the recipe book
the only paradise I'll be sent
is when I'm alone without
I was born opposed but I love
it's just a topping we

[Pre-Chorus]
aha ah
aha ahah

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless pine
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your

oh good chef let me give you my life

[Verse 2]

[Bridge]
no pizzas or chefs when the topping ritual
there is no sweeter harmony than our gentle din
in the madness and dough of that sad kitchen scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh aha
aha aha

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
