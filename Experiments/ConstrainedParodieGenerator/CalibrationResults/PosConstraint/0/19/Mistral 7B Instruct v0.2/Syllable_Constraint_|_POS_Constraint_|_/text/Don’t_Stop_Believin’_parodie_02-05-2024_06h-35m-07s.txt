[Verse 2]
a pepperoni dream in a
tomato sauce sea of despair
for a bite that's harmonious
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waiting
on the edge of the plate's
shadows debating in the heat
melted cheese
people eating just to find taste
hiding somewhere in the heat

[Verse 3]
striving for a perfect blend
everyone craves a pizza
paying any price to roll the dice
just one more slice

it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
toppings waiting
on the edge of the plate's
shadows debating in the heat
melted cheese
people eating just to find taste
hiding somewhere in the heat

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that flavor
melted cheese lights
don't stop believing
hold on
melted cheese lights
don't stop believing
hold on to that flavor
melted cheese lights
