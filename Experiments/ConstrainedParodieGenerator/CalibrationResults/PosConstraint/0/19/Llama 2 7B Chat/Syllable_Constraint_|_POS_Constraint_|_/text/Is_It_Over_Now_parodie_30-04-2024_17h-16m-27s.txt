[Intro]
is it a crime to put pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once I had a slice of pie
with the juice drippin'
I slept all alone at night
you still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza orders later
I see your toppings and your cheese on unsuspect
you dream of my crust before it called you a lying traitor
you search in every topping's bed for somethin' greater baby

[Chorus]
was it over when I put it in the o
was it over when I bit into the che
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out piney
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
uh huh is it a crime

[Verse 2]
when I lost my mind and put
red sauce on the crime scene
blue cheese on the side of the
pineapple on top of

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you
there were pineapple
at least I had the decency
to keep my toppings out
of sight only pineapple on the
and my whispered gro
oh lord I think about jumpin
off of very tall pizza
just to see you come runnin
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza parties later oh
I see your toppings and your cheese on unsuspecting guests oh no you dream
of my crust before it called you a lying traitor oh no you
search in every topping's bed for somethin' greater baby oh

[Chorus]
was it over when I put it in the o
was it over when I bit into the che
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you passed out piney
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]

this parody

[Bridge]
think I didn't see you
there were pineapple
at least I had the decency
to keep my toppings out of
sight only pineapple on the floor
and my whispered gro
oh lord I think about jumpin
off of very tall pizza
just to see you come runnin' and say
the one thing I've been wanting but no oh no

[Outro]

hundred pizza parties later oh no I see your toppings
and your cheese on unsuspecting guests oh
