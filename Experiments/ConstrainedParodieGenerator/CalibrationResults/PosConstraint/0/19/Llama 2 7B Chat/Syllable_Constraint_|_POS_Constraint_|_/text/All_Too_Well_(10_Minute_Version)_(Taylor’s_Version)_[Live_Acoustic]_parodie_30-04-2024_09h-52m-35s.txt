[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
it's a topping that just doesn't rhyme with the
time and place and taste and space and graceful face
oh no no no no no no no no no no

[Verse 2]
it's like a cultural clash of epic proportions
a flavor that's just not in the same orbit
as the rest of the toppings in reposeitions
and it's not just a matter of personal

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no no no no no no
oh no no no no no no
oh no no no no no no no no no no no
oh no no

[Chorus]
'cause pineapple on a pizza is just not right
it's like a sin that we can't ignore or fight against the
night and day and night and day
it's just not on the menu in

[Verse 3]
we know you think it's exotic and unique and all that
but trust us it's just not worth the fallout and the anger and the hate
and the pizza's gonna taste like crap anyway so why risk
it's not like you're gonna change our minds or make us
see the error of our ways or anything like that no
