[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the topping from my nightmare
the disgrace in the pizza world above
the abomination that
should never be on a pie
we can live without pineapple if we want
and not have to endure the
disgust and dismay of the pizza
community in disarray and cha
we'll have pepperoni

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the respect for the class
the traditional toppings that we em
hold dear and cherish so much more
than any fruit that
tastes like a tropical island getaway
but is not invited to
the pizza party and should
not be allowed to stay and play with
the rest of the toppings in the
pizza world that we know and
love and adore and will never let go
and as I stare at

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're al
ready the topping that
should never be on a
pizza and will always be rejected and
shunned by the pizza world
community in dis

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple you're al
ready the topping that
should never be on a
pizza and will always be rejected and
shunned by the pizza world
community in dis
don't waste your time on pineapple you're al
ready the topping that
should never be on a
pizza and will always be rejected and
shunned by the pizza world
community in dis

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
