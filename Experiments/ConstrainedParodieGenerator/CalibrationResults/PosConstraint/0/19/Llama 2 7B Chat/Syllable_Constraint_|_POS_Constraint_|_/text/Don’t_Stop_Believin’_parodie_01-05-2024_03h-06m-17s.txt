[Verse 1]
just a pineapple on a pizza town girl liv
she took the midnight train goin' anywhere
just a pizza topping born and raised in hawai
it's sweet and tangy goin' anywhere go

[Verse 2]
a flavor in a slice of che
the smell of tropical breeze and
for a topping they can share the
it's a fruit explosion in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers savor
up and down the pizza joint
their tastebuds explorin' in
syrup and che
livin' just to find flavorful
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to get the right
everybody wants a slice
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more to

[Verse 4]
some will crust it on top
some will fold it in a bow
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers savor
up and down the pizza joint
their tastebuds explorin' in
syrup and che
livin' just to find flavorful
hidin' somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop toppin' hold
on to that flavorful
pizza joint pe
don't stop toppin' hold
on to
pizza joint pe
don't stop toppin' hold
on to that flavorful
pizza joint pe
