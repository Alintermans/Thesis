[Verse 1]
pineapple
oh no don't put that on my pizza
it's a crime against culina
I can't believe you'd even
consider such a topping so

[Verse 2]
secondary to
the cheese and sauce so fine and smoothly blended in
it just doesn't belong
like a sore thumb in a suit so fine
it's just not a good fit you see

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet
of cheese and pepperoni only
never knew that pineapple was
a pizza topping option oh no oh no oh no
never knew that pineapple was
a pizza topping option oh
no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza oh no
it's just not for me oh
pineapple on a pizza oh no
it's just not for me oh
no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no

[Verse 3]
third times the
charm for the toppings on my pizza
I'll stick with the classic
never gonna change my mind oh no oh
never gonna change my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a di
of cheese and pepperoni so
never knew that pineapple was
a pizza topping option oh
no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza oh no
it's just not for me oh
pineapple on a pizza oh no
it's just not for me oh
no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no

[Verse 4]
last things last
my pizza is perfect just the way it
I don't need no pineapp
exotic fruit on my pie
it's just not for me oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on a diet of cheese and pepperon
never knew that pineapple was a pizza topping option
oh no no no

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza oh no
it's just not for me oh
pineapple on a pizza oh no
it's just not for me oh
