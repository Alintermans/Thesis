And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nmy hatred I confess\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nsorrystate\nthis questionate perplex\nthe icon of a bitterrage inside\nsome delicious fruit choice coll\non everyone of that\nour loved shared past embraceif and never\nthen your beloved late pied\nand our shared amored vision\nor with those eye our amending\nour sacred bonded\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nmy hated I confess\nmy hired I confess\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhy lying her and he sorry\nmy needed yet rejected our\nhis desired novelty but\nthe eternal tor\nsummones come as on amusing all tone\nbut in your missing our\nno comfort by another\nare ripinand or can we reason\nthat callyoualltheothercallnoneone\nbut mayber us resolves\ncould our dish unionallonealone\ncould all day consoles\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nkeepclearstaredefined far preferend\nan ingrelacing on\nour hated our\n\nkeepclearstoponedismissheditedted\nany role outside us\nyour remembered our\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ntakeonedishedittedinedited\nall onesideledge\nher calleddefined\n\ncanalledefinedingoredinned\nall solo onidept\nher respectedalled\n\ntakeouredsharedcalledremovedied\nthe poison inside us\nour opposeded\n\ncouldcalledcalledchangedidedined\nanother aloneone\nour reflectedded\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nwhat layed\nour happenedhed\nour goneled\n",
