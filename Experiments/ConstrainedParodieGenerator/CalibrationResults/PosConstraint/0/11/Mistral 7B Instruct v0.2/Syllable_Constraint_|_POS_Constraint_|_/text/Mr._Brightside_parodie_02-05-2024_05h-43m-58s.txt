[Verse]
branching out in thekitchen I've been cookin' just fine
gotta remember when adding just pineapple
started out so simple which toppings to choosenow it
we lost our taste buds in this culinary
upheavalwhat began as delicious pizza
with herbs and meaty sauces now it's gonna be
topped with pineapple slices making me cringe and
my taste buds revolt in

[Pre-Chorus]
but their faces satisfied
our combined delight
get it off
but it's causing me strifeand creating
and arguingover
