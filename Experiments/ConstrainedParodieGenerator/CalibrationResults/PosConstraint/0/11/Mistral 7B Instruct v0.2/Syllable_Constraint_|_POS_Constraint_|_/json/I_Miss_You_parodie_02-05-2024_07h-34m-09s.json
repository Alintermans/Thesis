And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI blame you my beloved\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nellopi\nan abundance of my mis\nthe dish that's pie atop me pigzone ill\nan ingredious mistake pit\nthat bringer of an invas\nour sacred riedgededgededceded\nsovereely our shared\nand he xmas amendedhedamed\nand by the pieweight our lovewill\nour shared hatredhed\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI blame you my beloved\nmy ideddededed\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhy must you and your felleded\nyour hatedhedatededdedhedhed\nyour inededionedneded\nan otherhed add\nhazehhauntdin broughthedened around on\nor in our supposed her\nall dweb of this all eating\nteddedlederedning eddlesson\nthat callyoucallyoucallcallcall\nbut pleasehedheadeded\npleaseppediededdeddedhedhedded\ncomeonedowned\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\npleasehedhedendedonededingwed\nnothedonedothoth\nyour rememberedred\n\ndohedhedheadingdedenedonedhed\nnothedonedothoth\nyour rememberedred\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nbeonedhedheadedhednedodedhedhed\nnothedonedothoth\nyour removedended\n\ndohedhedprocessingpleduedprocessing\nnothedonedothoth\nyour remainedended\n\ndonehedhandedendedhedoningthing\nnothedonedothoth\nour hatedhedped\n\ncanmededervedredheadeddingaged\nnothedonedothoth\nyour fadedefined\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nmy hateditedted\nmy lovedomedded\nmy complainedided\n",
