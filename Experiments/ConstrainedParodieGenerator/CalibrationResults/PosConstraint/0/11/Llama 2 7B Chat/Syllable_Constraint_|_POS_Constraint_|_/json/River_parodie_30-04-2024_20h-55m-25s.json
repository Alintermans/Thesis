He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI walk into a pizza par\nfind the most unlikely pair\nananas and cheese on top of pepperoni in my face\njust when I thought it couldn't get more bizarrely hair\nthat's when I saw it pop up on\nfacehole and I couldn't believe those lying\nwhy is every veg\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nmy be half'halfies half pie because they plant\ncover wayne but honestly wayne\nin he place to order his mustard\nand my how has ough makes ough ough ough ough ough ough\nits can all looks ions their be out I order\nit right ough ough ough ough ough ough ouses\nbut wait who ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough\nhow ough made ough I ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough\non her mustard ough twice cause\nor my ough ough could ough ough get ough ough ough ough ough ough\nand my ough would ough break ough ough my ough ough ough\nfather into ough would ough cause ough pain ough ough ough ough\nfor my ough would ough he ough ough\ntake ough my ough ough ough ough cause ough ough ough ough ough\nbut my ough ough ough cannot ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough\neatherside I ough ough ough ough ough cause ough\nthough ough ough knows ough needs ough ough ough ough\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI walk into another par\nfor the mostlikely lies\nananas and pineapple on top of pepperoni in\njust when I thought it couldn't get more bizarrely hair\nthat's when I saw it pop up on\nthere shows but who ough ough ough ough ough ough lies ough\nwhy ould any eatants\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nsome ough half to ough ough ough ough ough ough\nmy ounced covered ough wayne ough his mustard ough\nits ough ough ough ough makes ough ough ough ough ough\nough its ough again ough ough ough ough ough ough\nhow ough made ough could ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough\nmy does ough ough ough ough twice ough ough ough ough ough ough\ndoored ough ough a ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough\nmake how ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough\nup ough will ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough\ntake ough my ough will ough ough ough cause ough\nthough ough knows ough needs ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough\nnewest ough is ough it ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough\nor more ough ough could ough ough be ough be ough\neatoeside causes ough ough ough ough ough\nmore mustard ough ough ough cause ough ough\nknowing ough he ough ough ough it ough ough ough ough\nfather ough pain ough will ough ough ough ough\nwhy ough though ough ough some\nits ough ough mustard ough ough ough ough ough ough\nto stay needs ough ough be ough you ough put ough enough ough show\nsign\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pineapple\nliver\nwalk\nparodi\nplease he ough ough ough cause\nwell idge ough takes ough ough twice ough ough\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\noutside some body ough ough lies ough cause\nlook will ough know ugh ough show ough ough ough\nbut father could ough cause ough ough ough ough ough ough ough ough\nlies ough ough ough shows ough ough ough ough causes ough ough\nevery ough how ough ough ough could ough\nits ough ough mustard ough twice\nand my mustard ough would he ough ough cause\nthe lies causes does I ough ough hide ough ough cause\nits gets tired its goes my does ohio\nbreakside I ough ough ough he ough cause\nanger why ough must we ough ough mustard ough\nmy ought ough ough causes ough ough ough ough ough\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI walked into a post ioned\nby a mostlikely lies\nananas and pineapple on top of pepperoni in\nwell little one\nits falling\n\nmy apologies ough ough ough could ough\nour must\n\nout that ough ough ough causes ough\na lotta ough ough lies ough ough ough ough ough ough\n",
