[Verse 1]
why pineapple on a pizza should
be forbidden by the lord above
it clashes with the cheese and sauce and toppings too
its tropical flavor can't
compete with pepperoni and
mushrooms and olives too hallelujah halle

[Chorus]
don'tu luaja everybody
dreams of pineapple on a pie

[Verse 2]
you adore the tropical delight
but think of anchovies at night
they're aroma overpowers everything
our shared heritage their to
our combined her sonography
oregano and basil they yearn to be

[Chorus]
don'tu luaja everybody
dreams of pineapple on a pie

[Verse 3]
