[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should not
be a crime against humanity
it's a topping that just doesn't belong oh no
it clashes with the flavors and
the texture is all wrong oh please
don't put it on a pie that's holy oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Verse 2]
the cheese is melted golden brown go
the sauce is tangy and sweet go
the pepperoni is crispy and brown go
but pineapple just doesn't fit
it's like a dissonant note in a
chord of flavors that just don't go oh no

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Verse 3]
you may think it's exotic and
you may think it's unique oh no
but on a pizza it just doesn't belong
it's like a crime against culinary
oh please don't commit this sin
no hallelujah no hallelujah

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Verse 4]
there are so many other to
ppings that are better than oh no go
classic pepperoni or sausage would be
better choices than pineapple
oh please don't make this mistake
no hallelujah no hallelujah oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Outro]
pineapple on a pizza should

[Additional Lyrics]
baby I know this topping
it's a crime against flavor go
it doesn't belong on a pie that's holy
and it's not a hallelujah moment
oh no go no go no go no
it's a pineapple no no no no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
there are so many other to
ppings that are better than oh no
go for classic pepperoni or sausage
they're the ones that belong on a pie
oh please don't commit this sin
no hallelujah no hallelujah oh no

[Additional Lyrics]
you may think it's exotic
you may think it's unique oh no
but on a pizza it just doesn't belong
it's like a dissonant note in a be
chorus of flavors that just don't
go oh no go no go no go no go no go
