[Verse 1]
pineapple
uh oh no no no no no no no no
can't put it on a pizza
it just don't belong there no
the flavors clash and the texture

can't you see it's a crime against pizzahood
putting fruit on a pie
it's like putting ketchup on a ste
no no no no no no no no

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised by pizza lovers
learning the ways of the sauce and che
the toppings that bring us joy and
the feeling of satisfaction that only a hot
made from scratch pie can bring us home
singing from heartache from the pain
seeing the beauty through the che
making memories that will last

[Chorus]
pineapple you don't belong on

it's a fruit that's sweet and juicy

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised by pizza lo
learning the ways of the sauce and
the toppings that bring us joy and
the feeling of satisfaction
that only a hot made from scratch pie can bring us home
