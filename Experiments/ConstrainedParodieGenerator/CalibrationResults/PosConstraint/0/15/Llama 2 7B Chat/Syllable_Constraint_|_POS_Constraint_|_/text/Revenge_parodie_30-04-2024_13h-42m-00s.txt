[Intro]
I think I I think I finally
found a reason to hate pineapp
on a pizza it should never be
you know what they say it's just
not my jam

[Verse]
I can't believe I ever
thought it was a good idea to combine sweet and sav
like it's a party in my mouth and
everyone's invited but the pineapple
it's just so out of place and awk
I can't let it stay on my pie it's gotta go it
ain't nobody got time for that noise
it's like a tropical vacation on my plate when I'm cra
just trying to eat my cheese and
sauce and pepperoni in peace can't we just agree
pineapple belongs on the beach not
on my pizza please I beg of thee take it
off my plate it's just too much for
me it's like a party in my mouth and everyone's not
invited I can't enjoy my food
when there's pineapple getting in the way it's just too much for

[Chorus]
in my pizza it
won't rot in hell
in my pizza it won't
rot in hell it won
in my pizza it won't
rot in hell it won

[Outro]
in my pizza it
won't rot in hell is
my pizza it won't
rot in hell it won't won't
rot in
