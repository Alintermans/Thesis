[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie
my taste buds are in disguise bad mix
tropical flavors don't belong
on a savory dish like that
it's a culinary mistake
they should be illegal
pineapple doesn't belong on a
piece of culinary
heresy is what it is to me
I can't abide the thought of
sweet and juicy on a savory
it's just not right you see to me to
pineapple on a pizza
it's like a sin to me to see
can you imagine a

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no oh
amen amen

[Chorus]
don't put the
pineapple on a pizza please oh lord have mer
its a sacrilegious act I must protest with
my utmost sincerity
pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza it's a
gastronomical blasphemy to me to see
it's like a crime against culinary law to
pineapple on a pizza
it's just not natural to me to

[Verse 2]
I know some may say that it's just a
flavor combination
but to them I say with all due
respect that's just not true you
see this is where we differ in taste
pineapple belongs on a fruit
stand not on a pizza plate
it's a travesty of the
highest order to me to see
pineapple on a pizza it
goes against all that

[Chorus]
don't put the
pineapple on a pizza please oh lord have mer
its a sacrilegious act I must protest with
my utmost sincerity
pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza it's a
gastronomical blasphemy to me to see
it's like a crime against culinary law to
pineapple on a pizza
it's just not natural to me to

[Bridge]
I know some may say that it's just a matter of
personal preference but to them I say with all due
respect that's just not enough to make it right to
see pineapple on a pizza is a culinar

[Pre-Chorus]
oh no oh lord
amen amen

[Chorus]
don't put the
pineapple on a pizza please oh lord have mer
its a sacrilegious act I must protest with
my utmost sincerity
pineapple doesn't belong on a
pizza it's a
gastronomical blasphemy to me to see
it's like a crime against culinary law to
pineapple on a pizza
it's just not natural to me to
