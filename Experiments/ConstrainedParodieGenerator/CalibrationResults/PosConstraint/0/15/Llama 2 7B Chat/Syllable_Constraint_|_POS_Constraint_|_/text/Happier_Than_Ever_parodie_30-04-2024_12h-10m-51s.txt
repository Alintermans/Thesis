[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
ain't no reason why it
I'm happier than ever when
it's not on my plate now

[Verse 1]
give me a slice to chew on something sweet and juicy
to complement my meal oh
do you read my mind when you
see the toppings on my pie
or do you skip my preference
when you put pineapple on
I knew it was a mistake
I'd end up feeling quite irate now I wish it
weren't for the toppings on my pie now
I'd be singing a happy tune now I wish I could explain it bet
but I can't because it
ain't no reason why it
it just don't belong on my pie I wish it wasn
wasn't for the toppings on top

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie no reason why it should
be on there it's just not my cup of tea I wish it
weren't for the toppings on my pie now I'd be happy as can
be I wish I could explain

[Verse 2]
you put pepperoni on my mind
I can't help but feel inclined to
do you read my thoughts when you see the toppings
on my pizza that you bring to me oh
I knew it was a mistake
I'd end up feeling quite irate
now I wish it wasn't true oh
I could explain it better

[Verse 3]
you put bacon on my mind when you see the toppings on
my pizza that you bring to me oh how
I knew it was a mistake I'd end up feeling
quite irate now I wish it wasn't true oh
I could explain it better I wish it
weren't for the toppings on my pie
now I'd be singing a happy tune I wish I could explain
it but I can't because it just don't belong
on my pizza I wish it weren't for the toppings on
my pie now I'd be happy as can be no

[Outro]
pineapple on a pie no
reason why it should be there it's just
not my cup of tea I wish
weren't for the toppings on my pie now
