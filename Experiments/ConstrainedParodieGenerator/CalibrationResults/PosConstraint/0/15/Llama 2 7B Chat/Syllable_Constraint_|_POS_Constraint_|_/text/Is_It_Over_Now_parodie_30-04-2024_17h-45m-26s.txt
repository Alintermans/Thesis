[Intro]
is it a crime being served on a plate

[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
oh no please don't let it be
it doesn't belong on a
it's like putting jam

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza preferences
I can't believe you would even suggest it barbaric
you dream of my cheese but you won't even try it caram
you search for the perfect topping but you won't even see it

[Chorus]
was it over when they delivered the pie
was it over when they said no pineapple
I whispered in their ear and they
didn't even hear me crying oh
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
no no no no no no

[Verse 2]
pepperoni and sausage
oh please don't make me
chicken and bacon too cause
I can't even think

[Bridge]
and did you think I wouldn't notice
the way you ordered
like a pineapple pizza is
like a crime against human
just plain wrong just plain wrong just plain wrong
just plain wrong just plain
wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong
just plain wrong just plain wrong just
just plain wrong just plain wrong just
just plain wrong just plain wrong just plain wrong just plain

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza preferences lat
I can't believe you would even suggest it barbaric you dream of
my cheese but you won't even try it caramel you search for
the perfect topping but you won't even see it caramel

[Chorus]
was it over when they delivered the pie
was it over when they said no pineapple
I whispered in their ear and they
didn't even hear me crying oh

[Post-Chorus]

[Bridge]
