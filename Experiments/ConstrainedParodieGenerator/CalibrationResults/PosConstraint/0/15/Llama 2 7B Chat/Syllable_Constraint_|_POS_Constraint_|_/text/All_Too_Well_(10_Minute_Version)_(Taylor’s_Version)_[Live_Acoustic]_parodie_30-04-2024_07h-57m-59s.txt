[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should be a crime
how could you even consider such a thing
it's like putting ketchup on a hot dog in
time it wastes away is time we can never

[Verse 2]
the flavors don't match and the texture's all wrong
it's like someone took a slice of paradise
ripped it right out from under our noses and
threw it on a plate with a topping that just

[Pre-Chorus]
and we can't help but feel
a sense of disbelief and
betrayal at the sheer audacity of it
pineapple

[Chorus]
because pineapple on a pizza is like
a best friend who's always there for you but never really gets
you back and it's like trying
to find the perfect song on the

[Verse 3]
the radio when you're driving home from a long day at
work and you just want to let loose and sing at the top of your lungs but
no matter how hard you try that one song always seems to be
just out of reach and it's like pineapple on apizz
it's just not meant to be and we can't help but wonder what
other toppings could have made it perfect instead
and we're left with this bitter taste in our mouths and
we can't help but wonder why they even tried in the
first place because pineapple on
a pizza is like a relationship that
just never quite works out and
we're left picking up the pieces and trying to make sense
of it all and it's just not worth the risk because let

[Pre-Chorus]
we know that pineapple on
a pizza is a crime against
humanity and nature and we can
hardly believe that anyone

[Chorus]
would ever dare to commit such a foul and we
can only hope that the trend will soon fade away and be cons
remembered as a dark
age in the history of cul
ine and pizza and we can finally move on to
greener pastures and better toppings and never have to
suffer through another
pineapple pizza again because

[Bridge]
it's like they say in the business world don
always look before you le
and when it comes to toppings on a pie
always stick to the
classics and never take
chances because you never know
what you might find yourself in for and we can't help but feel
a sense of unease every time we see someone taking
a bite of that sweet and spicy combination
because it's just not right and we

[Verse 4]
can't help but wonder what other toppings could have
made that pizza perfect instead and we
are left with this sour taste in our mouths and a feeling of dis
belief that maybe they just
weren't meant to be in the pizza game at
all and maybe they should have stuck to what they know and love and not taken
chances with something as sacred as
a pizza topping because pineapple
on a pizza is
like a relationship that just never quite
works out and we're left picking up the pieces and
trying to make sense of it all and it's just not worth the risk and
we can't help but wonder why they even tried in the

[Verse 5]
first place because pineapple on a pizza is
like a song that just never quite fits the melody and we're left with
this feeling of disappointment and disbelief and
we can't help but think of all the other to
ppings that could have made it perfect instead and we
are left with this bitter taste in our mouths and a
sense of unease every
time we see someone taking aslice

[Chorus]
because pineapple on a pizza is
like a relationship that just never quite works out
and we're left picking up
the pieces and trying to make
sense of it all and it's just
not worth the risk and we
can't help but wonder
why they even tried in
the first place because it
just doesn't belong on a pie

[Verse 6]
we know that pineapple on a pizza is a crime against
humanity and nature and we can't
hardly believe that anyone would dare
to commit such a foul and we can only
hope that the trend will soon fade away
and be remembered as a dark age in the his
tory of culinary
and pizza and we can finally move
on to greener pastures and bet
ter toppings and never have to

[Outro]
suffer through another pineapple pizza again be
cause it's just not worth the risk and we can't help but
wonder why they even tried in the first place because it just doesn
doesn't belong on a pie and we're left
with this bitter taste in our mouth
and a sense of unease every
time we see someone taking a bite of that
sweet and spicy combination because
it's just not right and we can't help
but feel a sense of disbelief and
unbelief that maybe they just
weren't meant to be in the pizza game
at all and maybe they should have stuck
to what they know and love and not tak
chances with something as sacred
as a pizza topping because pineapp
on a pizza is like a rela
tionship that just never quite works out
and we're left picking up the pieces andtry
