[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I tried to put pineapp
on a pizza once beforehand
but now I see it's just a sinful
disaster waiting to be

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
it's like a tropical
invasion of flavors uninvite
cheesy goodness overload
pineapple doesn't belong on a pie
it's like trying to put a
flower in a frying pan
and we can't let that happen you see
because pizza is an art form in itself

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells are ringin' loud and
cavalry choirs are singin' out of
be my pineapple I beg of
my crust is crispy and golden brown oh
but pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza in this town oh
never an honest word
and that was when pineapple was

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it's a sweet and sour attack
I can't even taste the che
let alone the sauce and pepperon
pineapple takes the cake and eats it slow
pizza is supposed to be
a savory delight not a
fruit salad in sight oh no oh no oh no
don't put pineapple on

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
jerusalem bells are ringin' loud and
cavalry choirs are singin' out of
be my mirror my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason I can't explain
I know pineapple doesn't belong on
a pizza in this town
never an honest word I say

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
jerusalem bells are ringin' loud
cavalry choirs are sing
be my pineapple I beg of thee
my crust is crispy and
golden brown oh no oh no oh
don't put pine
on a pizza in this town oh no oh
never an honest word
but that was when pineapple was king
king of toppings oh no
no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no

[Outro]
