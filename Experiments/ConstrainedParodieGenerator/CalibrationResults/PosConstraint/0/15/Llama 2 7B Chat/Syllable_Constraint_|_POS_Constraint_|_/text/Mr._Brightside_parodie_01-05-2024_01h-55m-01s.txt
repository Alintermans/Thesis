[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza should not be the crime of
gotta take a stand before it's too late in time
it started out as a topping just like any other
but now it's taken over and it's all so ha
how did it end up like this I can't even
it was only a pizza it was only a
now I'm gettin' angry and she's callin' a cab
while he's havin' a slice

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's on top of the che
he takes off his hat now
let me go
'cause I just can't stand it no more it's kill
and takin' control

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pizza should not be
turnin' pizza into a
swimmin' through a sea of che
chokin' on a lie it's just
destiny is callin' me
open up my angry eyes
'cause I'm mister pizza

[Guitar Solo]
