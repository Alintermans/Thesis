[Intro]
come on pizza lovers gathering here tonight

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizzas got a hold on us
I want you to scrape it off the top with a
spoon why don't we leave it out
plain and simple
when textures clash and the flavors

delightful and I'm the one who will fight

[Chorus]
in this kitchen it's just
pineapple and pizza but you know
it's not the same as it
used to be in this kitchen it's just
pineapple and pizza
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza lovers calling out
why settle for something that doesn't fit
on a plate what's the point of
putting it there
cheese melts and sauce runs free but still
we're stuck with this pineapple
they just want to know it's edible not in

[Chorus]
in this kitchen it's just
pineapple and pizza but you know
it's not the same as it
used to be in this kitchen it's just
pineapple and pizza
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
go home try new toppings light speed options
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
leave tradition behind let go of the
pineapple fear not who's ordering first instead of

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was not the same as
it was not the same as
