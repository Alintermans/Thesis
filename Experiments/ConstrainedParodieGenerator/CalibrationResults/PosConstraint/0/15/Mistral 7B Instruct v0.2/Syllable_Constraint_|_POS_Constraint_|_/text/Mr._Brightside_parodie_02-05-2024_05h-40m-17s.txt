[Verse]
comin' out of my kitchen and I've been doin' just
gotta hide in the corner because pineapple
started out on the piecrustbut ended up on the dish
it was only a topping it was only a
now I'm changin' the channel and he's orderin
havin' a slice and she's puttin' on the pineap
now they're goin' to share and my taste buds reco
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but he's savourin' each bite
she takes off her bite now
let me go
'cause I just can't taste it feels so wrong it
and takin' control

[Chorus]
juxtaposition turns food lovers to
swimmin' through unwanted flav
chokin' on your excuses
but it's just the price I pay
gastronomy is callin
open up my critical
'cause I'm mr picky

[Guitar Solo]
