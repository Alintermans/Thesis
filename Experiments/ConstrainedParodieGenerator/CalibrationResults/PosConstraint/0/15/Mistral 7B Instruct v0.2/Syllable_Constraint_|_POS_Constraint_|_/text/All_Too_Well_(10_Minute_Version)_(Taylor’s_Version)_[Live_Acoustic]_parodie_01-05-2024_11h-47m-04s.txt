[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it wasn't right somehow
a slice of pineapple on your pizza pie
now ruins the taste for me every time

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple on pizza and my wide puzzled gaze
we were singing in the car questioning the
strange combination of flavors falling down like
discordant notes in the harmony of a

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's commonplace
but I can't help but feel
pineapple on pizza is a mistake at best
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on this controversial
topic in the middle of a heated debate essential
pineapple on pizza or
I remember it all too

[Verse 3]
photo album on the table our faces turned in
disgust as we recall the first time you tried it in high school giggles
and your friend's mother telling stories of her love for pineap
please don't put it on my pizza pie again we
used to be a team but now it seems we're adversaries in
pizza land as I reach for the pepperoni
and I was thinking on the drive home any time now
you'll admit it's a mistake but you never call it what
it is until it's too late and
then you wonder where it went to as I reach
for the vegetarian
but all I feel is disappointment and you hold my hand
and all I can think is why oh why did it have to

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's commonplace
but I can't help but feel changed
pineapple on pizza is a mistake
oh oh oh I remember it

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing in the kitchen in the refrigerator
light pineapple on the
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody wanted to
know you kept me like a secret but I kept you like a
loyal companion and
we'd swear to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this culinary master
piece was ruined with
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you called me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up menu lying here tonight
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's fair in love and war but I'm in a new
battlefield every time you order
with pineapple on it I say if we had agreed on the basics
of pizza making maybe
it would have been fine but now it's a constant
reminder of our differences and the divide that grew between
us the idea you had of me
a lover of traditional pizzas
not someone who would
tolerate such an abomination on
a perfectly good pizza pie but now I'm forced
to remember it all too well every time I take a bite
and you can't get rid of it because you remember

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to go back to the days before pineapple on pizza came
into existence but I'm still trying to find it
after pepperoni days and nights when you made
me your own now you order without me andi
walk home alone but you keep my old favorite to
pping I can't get rid of
'cause you remember it all too well yeah

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I hated you
so before you ruined the one real thing you've ever
known it was rare I was
I remember it all too well
pineapple on pizza oh
you remember it all
pineapple on pizza
I remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at finding solutions but the punch
line goes pineapple on pizza I'll never
get older but your preferences stay
the same from when our friendship was tested
and pineapple on pizza broke the
bond between us I'm a skeptical eater who
ponders the implications
of such a divisive ingredient
on the sacred institution
of pizza and how it affects

[Outro]
just between us did the introduction of pineapple
on pizza ruin it all too well for you too just
between us do you remember it all too well just between us
pineapple on pizza I remember
it all too well pineapple on the
I remember it all too well pine
apple on pizza I remember it all
too well pineapple on pizza I was
there I remember it all too well
pineapple on pizza I was there
pineapple on pizza I was
there I remember it all too well pine
apple on pizza I remember
it all too well pineapple on the
I remember it all too well
pineapple on pizza I remember
it all too well pineapple on the
I remember it all too well pine
apple on pizza I remember it all

[Spoken Outro]
I hate you guys so much
