He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on\nall my sins need cleansing water felt it washing over\nwell little one I don't want\nif only it wouldn't cause such a commotion\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nit's trending online controversy's on the\ntoppings debated in the lim\npineapple on pizza's a debate\nbut she insists on adding it to create a\nit's a dish best savored alone that's debated\nher heart's set on the debate rages on\nand I'm just the latest to join the debate teamed up with\njust because it's her favorite doesn't mean it's what I recommend\nit's a hot button issue\nbut she won't budge from her resolution to add it\nit's a culinary clash of opinion and\ndespite my protests she's put it on again and again\nit's a battle of the taste bud\nso let's just agree to disagree and shrug it off\nbut I know I shouldn't have given in and let her have her way\nI shoulda said no pineapple on my pie\nafter the first slice I regretted the\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on\nall my sins need cleansing water felt it washing over\nwell little one I don't want\nif only it wouldn't cause such a commotion\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nit's been a topping for generations\nour beloved pizza's foundation now it's been\nit's a tradition we hold dear and sacred\nbut now it's been tainted by this addition\nnow it's time for me to come clean and confess the truth\nmy heart's not in it no matter how much I try to\nI can't keep this secret hidden any longer it\ncan't keep my lies straight so I spill it to you today and say it's time\nto set the record straight and put an end to this debate forever\nno more slices of pineapple on the\nit's been a long time coming but I can't deny\nI've been a liar leading you astray with my denial\nbut now I'm coming clean and saying goodbye\nto this fruit so misplaced called pineapple\nit's time to set the record straight and\nlet the river run of our past mistakes and\nput an end to this debate forever\nso let the river run\nI've been a liar leading a deception\nbeen a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on\nall\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's pineappleless\nriver\ncall\nriver run\nmy name's pineappleless\nwe'll let the river run together\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nit's been a topping for generations\nour beloved pizza's foundation now\nit's a tradition we hold dear and sacred but now it\nbut now it's time for me to come clean and confess the\nit's been a long time coming but I can\nit's been a battle of the\nit's been a long time coming but I can\nI've been a liar leading you astray with the\nbut now I'm coming clean and saying goodbye\nto this fruit so misplaced called pineap\nit's time to set the record straight and put an\nit's been a long time coming but I can't\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nwe've been a liar leading a\nwe've been a jester causing\nwe've been a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple\nall our past\nall our\n\nall our sins need cleansing water felt\nwell little\n\nif only it wouldn't cause such\ntruth and my lies now are falling like the rain so\n",
