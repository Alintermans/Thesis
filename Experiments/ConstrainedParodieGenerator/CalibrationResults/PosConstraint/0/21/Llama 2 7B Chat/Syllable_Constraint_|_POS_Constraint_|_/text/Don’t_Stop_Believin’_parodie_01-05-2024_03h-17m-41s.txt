[Verse 1]
just a pineapple fanatic living in a
he took a bite and thought it was a crime to
not on top of the pizza he was in his prime
it goes on and on and on and on and on

[Verse 2]
a pineapple lover in a
the smell of sweetness fills the air
for a taste they'll share the night oh
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
waitin'
up and down the menu board
their tastebuds searchin' in the
flavors people
livin' just to find the perfect
chopstick somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
workin' hard to find the right
everybody wants a slice
payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more time

[Verse 4]
some will savor the sweet
some will curse the heat
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
waitin'
up and down the menu board
their tastebuds searchin' in the
flavors people
livin' just to find the perfect
chopstick somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop devour
hold on to that flavor
menu items
don't stop devour
hold on
menu items
don't stop devour
hold on to that flavor
menu items
