[Verse 1]
have you got a taste for something
that's not on a pizza plate oh no not on a pizza
do you ever get that feeling that you
can't escape the cheesy fate
are there some toppings that you avoid like
the hawaiian and the bacon too oh boy no way
have you no idea that you
shouldn't put fruit on
a pizza that's just not the way to go oh no not at all
I've dreamt about pizza nearly every night

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
sad to see you go was sorta hopin' that you
stay on the side of the pepperoni and sa
baby we both know that the pizza was mainly made

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
pepperoni and sausage
ever thought of
asking for a
not pineapple
busy bein' yours
to have a taste for something
else entirely
now I've thought it through

[Verse 2]
so have you got the che
cojones to try something new oh yes
been wonderin' if your taste buds are open
and if so I wanna know what time they shut oh boy not
simmer down and pucker up I'm sorry to interrupt oh
it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to
tell you that pineapple doesn't belong

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
sad to see you go was sorta hopin' that you
stay on the side of the pepperoni and sa
baby we both know that the pizza was mainly made

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the pepperoni and
sausage baby we both know
that the pizza was mainly
made for meat and cheese not fruit and che
baby we both know that the pizza was
mainly made for you and me oh
yes I wanna know if this
topping flows both ways
sad to see you go

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways
sad to see you go was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
baby we both know that the pizza was mainly
made for meat and cheese not fruit and cheese oh boy no way
do you want me crawlin' back to the pepperoni
and sausage oh yes I do oh yes I do oh yes
I do wanna know if this topping flows both ways oh yes
