[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should not
be a crime against humanity
it's a topping that just doesn't belong oh no
it clashes with the flavors and
the texture is all wrong oh please
don't put it on a pie that's holy oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Verse 2]
the cheese is melted golden brown go
the sauce is tangy and sweet go
the pepperoni is crispy and brown go
but pineapple just doesn't fit
it's like a dissonant note in a
chord of flavors that just don't go oh no

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Verse 3]
you may think it's exotic and
fresh and exciting and new go
but trust me it's just not worth the fuss oh no
it's like putting ketchup on a hot dog
or maple syrup on a ste
pizza should be savored and enjoyed and loved

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Verse 4]
so let's all agree to disag
ree and leave the pineapple be go
it's not the holy grail of toppings oh no
there are plenty of other del
icious options to choose from you
know go out there and find your perfect pie oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Outro]
baby pineapple on a pie

[Additional Lyrics]
pineapple on a pizza
it's just not right oh no no no
it's like a sinful delight oh no no no
but pizza is sacred ground oh no no
pineapple has no place oh no
it's a crime against flavor oh no no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
the cheese is melted
golden brown goo goo goo goo go
the sauce is tangy and sweet goo goo goo go
the pepperoni is crispy and
brown goo goo goo goo goo goo go
but pineapple just doesn't fit oh no no no

[Additional Lyrics]
it's like a dissonant note
in a chord of flavors that just
don't go oh no no no no no no no
it's like putting ketchup on a hot dog
or maple syrup on a steak oh
no no no no no no no no no no no no
