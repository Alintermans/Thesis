[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
ain't no reason why it
I'm happier than ever when
it's not in my sightline

[Verse 1]
give me a slice to chew on something sweet and juicy
don't put pineapple on
it clashes with the flavors
do you hear me when I say
don't put pineapple
it's not my favorite way to
eat my pizza
when I say no pineapple please don't ignore
me I'm begging you please don't put it
on my pizza it doesn't belong you see it's like a crime against
humanity it's like a
violation of all that
is right and good and holy it's like a sinful act
of culinary treason it

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie ain't no reasonwhy
I'm happier than ever when it's not in
my sightline it's like a crime against humanity it's like a
violation of all that

[Verse 2]
you call me a pineapple lover
but I ain't no fan of yours just
because it's not a pizza topper it's like
a slap in the face it's like
a middle finger to the
pizza gods it's like a betray
of the pizza nation it's like
a treasonous act of cul

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
because that shit's absurd it's like
a joke that's gone too far it's like
a punchline that's fallen flat it's like a
pizza topping that's been overdone
you made me hate this pizza with a passion it's like a hate
that I can't abate it's like a
pizza that's been burnt to a crisp it's
like a sinful act of culinary war

[Outro]
pineapple on a pie it
ain't no reason why it don't
make me happier than you
ever I'm happier than ever when
it
