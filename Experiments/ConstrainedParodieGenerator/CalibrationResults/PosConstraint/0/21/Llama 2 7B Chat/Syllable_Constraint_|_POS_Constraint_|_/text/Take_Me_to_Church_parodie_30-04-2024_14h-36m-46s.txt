[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie
my taste buds disagree with the crime
don't put it on a pizza please
it's not a tropical delight
it's a culinary mistake
we shouldn't compromise
our pizza's integrity for
a fruit that doesn't fit
our taste buds protest with all their
might and main forcefully declare
pineapple has no place on a pie
no matter the occasion or the
crowd's insistence on its grace
we stand firm in our convict
pizza purity and

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh oh
amen amen

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off the pizza please do not deceive me with its
sweetness and its juiciness it doesn't belong
among the cheese and the sau
meat and the crunch it's a flavorful
disaster that
we can't abide by its presence in our
favorite dish it's a pizza sin and we won
refuse to commit this cul
gastronomical crime again and

[Verse 2]
we'll stick to the classic toppings that
we know and love so well
no experimentation or
fusion needed here just give
us the old reliable combo
that never fails to satisfy
pepperoni and sausage
mushrooms and onions too they
know their place on a pizza and
we won't tolerate any
novelty or ecc

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off the pizza please do not deceive me with its
sweetness and its juiciness it doesn't belong
among the cheese and the sau
meat and the crunch it's a flavorful
disaster that
we can't abide by its presence in our
favorite dish it's a pizza sin and we won
refuse to commit this cul
gastronomical crime again and

[Bridge]
our taste buds demand it our pizza trad
itions must be respected and adhered to we won't
tolerate any deviation from the norm
our pizza's integrity is at stake and we

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh oh oh
amen amen

[Chorus]
keep pineapple
off the pizza please do not deceive me with its
sweetness and its juiciness it doesn't belong
among the cheese and the sau
meat and the crunch it's a flavorful
disaster that
we can't abide by its presence in our
favorite dish it's a pizza sin and we won
refuse to commit this cul
gastronomical crime again and
