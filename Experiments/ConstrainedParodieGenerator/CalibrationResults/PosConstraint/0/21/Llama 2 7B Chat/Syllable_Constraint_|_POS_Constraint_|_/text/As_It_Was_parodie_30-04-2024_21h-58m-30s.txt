[Intro]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pie to

[Verse 1]
tropical flav
gonna make me throw up in
cannot abide the sweetness inside of me
why would you wanna deceive me
pineapple does
not belong on a pie like me
in this world of savory
and cheese and pepperoni too you see

[Chorus]
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
expectations
violated by the fruit
why would you wanna ruin my night with
your pineapple on top of
avocado
and bacon make a better pair
they go together without
you know it's not the same as it was before

[Chorus]
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of toppings
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
pizza is for meat lovers only please
I don't wanna taste the tropical breeze in me
leave the pineapple on the tree where it
belongs to me please don't misconstrue what I mean

[Outro]
don
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
