[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza it's just not worth the shower
or do you need more
is it just a fad that you're chasing

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
we're falling
in the toppings game we're standing tall order
for change
and in the bad times we fear it all

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something boy
ain't it gross how it just don't
or do you need more
ain't it hard keeping it on the floor

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
we're falling
in the toppings game we're standing tall order
for change
and in the bad times we fear it all

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we descend
we'll never meet the che
crash through the surface where it can't offend
we're far from the mundane now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the ha ha ha ha ha
in the ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
in the ha ha ha ha ha
we're far from the mundane now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ha ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we descend
we'll never meet the che
crash through the surface where it can't offend
we're far from the mundane now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
we're off the deep end watch
as we dive in we'll never meet the
crash through the surface where
we're far from the mundane now
