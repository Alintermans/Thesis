[Verse 1]
twenty years with this endless
struggle to keep pineapple off the pizza
it's a sensation un
my taste buds strongly objected when they
first heard of this abomination called a trend for
all mankind to ponder

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I see the pie dish
just to express my feelings of disdain
and I weary of this savory peculiar
and so I step away from the table and take a
deep breath and I get real high on my moral
ground and I shout with all my mighty
voice united

[Chorus]
and I say heyheyhey
heyheyhey
I said hey what's this on my pie
heyheyhey heyheyhey
I said hey
pineapple has no place here let

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
and I ple
oh my goodness do we
I plead all the time
in this debate room loud
and I pray
oh my goodness do we
we pray every single day
for tradition prev

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I groan sometimes when I see the pie dish
just to express my feelings of disdain
and I weary of this savory peculiar
and so I step away from the table and take a
deep breath and I get real high on my moral
ground and I shout with all my mighty
voice united

[Chorus]
and I say heyheyhey

[Outro]
twenty years and my life is
trying to keep pineapple off the pizza
for the sake of tradition
