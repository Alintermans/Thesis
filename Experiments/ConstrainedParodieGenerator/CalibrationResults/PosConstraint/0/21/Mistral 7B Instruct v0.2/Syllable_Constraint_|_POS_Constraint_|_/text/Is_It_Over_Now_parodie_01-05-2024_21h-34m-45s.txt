[Intro]
is it pineapple on a pizza night

[Verse 1]
once the meal was maderight
with the taste of savory bite
but you insisted on the
pineapple's strange all

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand slices later dearheart
you crave my cheeseboard but pineapple ruins it from the
start you dream of my pepperoni before it tarnished your
plate you search in every veggie pie for something more delight

[Chorus]
was it over when the pineapple touched the
melted cheese and sauce below was it over
when the sweet and savory flav
ors clashed and made your face contort in
disbelief was it over then and is it

[Post-Chorus]
is it over now is

[Verse 2]
when the ham and pineapple
clash in every bite
anchovies and pineapple
we just don't align

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you
adding pineapple
at least I had the decency
to hide my disappointment
only rumors about my love for
traditional ways
oh pineapple on a pizza
I think about arguing
just to see you understand
and say the one thing I want to hear but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to a thousand arguments later dearheart
if it's a hawaiian style you choose I will withhold my heart from you de
ar I dream of my pepperoni before it became a pine
apple crime you search in every pizza place for something more

[Chorus]
was it over when the pineapple touched the
melted cheese and sauce below was it over
when the sweet and savory flav
ors clashed and made your face contort in
disbelief was it over then and is it

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it over now is
it is
is it over

[Bridge]
think I didn't see you
adding pineapple
at least I had the decency
to hide my disappointment
only rumors about my love for
traditional ways
oh pineapple on a pizza
I think about arguing
just to see you understand tonight
and say the one thing I want to hear but no

[Outro]
arguments tonight flash
ing lights oh pineapple on a pizza night let's fast forward
to a thousand arguments later dear
and say the one thing I want
I want to hear but no
was it
was it over was it over was it over
