[Intro]
come on folks we wanna express our dismay

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
ruins the harmony ton
it belongs in a tropical zonenot
where it truly shines on its own
rotting away
when tradition gets in the way
pizza's reputation at
stake and we're the ones left to ponder and

[Chorus]
in this kitchen it's just
you know our pizzas not the same
in this kitchen it's just
you know our pizzas not the same
as it was before you
added that pineapple

[Verse 2]
take it away
serve us a classic pizza
why do you insist on this craziness
we don't want a surprise
ringing our
bells with complaints and disappro
vegetarians appro
ve but for us it's an abomination

[Chorus]
in this kitchen it's just
you know our pizzas not the same
in this kitchen it's just
you know our pizzas not the same
as it was before you
added that pineapple

[Bridge]
go veggie piequick deliverytime
we don't wanna debate the way that it used to
leave traditionbehind try something new
we don't wanna debate who's ordering it first

[Outro]
oh
as it was
you know our pizzas not the same
as it was before you
