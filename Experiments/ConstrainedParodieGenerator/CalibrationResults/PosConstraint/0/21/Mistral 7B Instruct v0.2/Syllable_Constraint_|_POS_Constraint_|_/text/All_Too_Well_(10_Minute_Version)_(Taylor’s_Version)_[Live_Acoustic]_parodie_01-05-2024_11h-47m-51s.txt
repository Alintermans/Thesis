[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it wasn't right somehow
a slice of pineapple on your pizza pie
now ruins the taste for me every time

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple on a pizza it's a mystery
we laughed and joked about it up in the tree
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
but I can't picture it after all these

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
and I might pretend to be okay but I'm not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little pizza
you almost choked on it because you were lookin'
pineapple in my mouth it
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter we were arguing heated
you used to eat it plain in your childhood bedroom beddeddown in sheets
and your parents shaking their heads at our unusual
combinations of toppings on our pizza team
and you were pushing me away insisting pineapple was
the way to gokey in hand we were always skip
ping town and I was thinking on the drive down any
time now you'd admit it was a mistake but all I felt
was disappointment and you held
my disappointed faceall too wellall too
wellall too wellall too well
or was it indifferenceall too wellall too wellall
too wellall too wellall too wellall too wellall too

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about it long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing in the kitchen in the refrigerator
light down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too
wellpineapple in my mouth it I remember it all
too welldown the stairs I was there I remember it all
too wellpineapple in the
fridge I was there I remember it

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I wanted too much
but maybe this combination was a
masterpiece till you
ruined it with pineap
please I remember it all too
wellpineapple in my mouth it I remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too wellall too well
pineapple in my mouth it I remember it
all too wellall too wellall too

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you add pineapple to
my pizza pie you said if we had been more alike maybe it would
have been fine but that made me
want to die the idea you had of me
a never picky eater whose taste reflects on me not me weeping in
the kitchen party bathroom someone
asking me what happened you that's what it
was you who added
pineapple to my pizza pieyou who added
pineapple to my pizza pieyou who added pine
apple to my pizza pieyou who added pineapple to my pie
and all I felt was disappointment and you held my lif

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after pepperoni days and nights when you made me
your own now you return my pizza and I walk
home alone but you keep my old slice from that first
week it reminds you of simplicity and it tastes
like me you can't get rid
of it pineapple it reminds you

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I hated you
back before you added pineapple to my pizza
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
pineapple on my pizza
you remember it all
down the stairs I was there
you remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pizza toppings stay
the same from when your pineapple broke mine
taste buds and bones I'm a pizza lover who
is returning half my appetite
and did the pineapple bruise turn your love sour
just between us did the love
affair sour you too did the love aff
air sour you too did the love
affair sour you too did the

[Outro]
I love you guys so much just between us I remember
