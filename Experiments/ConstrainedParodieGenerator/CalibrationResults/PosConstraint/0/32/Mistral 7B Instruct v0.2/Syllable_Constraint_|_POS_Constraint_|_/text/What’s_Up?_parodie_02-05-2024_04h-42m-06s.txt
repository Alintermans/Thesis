[Verse 1]
twenty years with this endless
fighting to keep pineapple off that great big
pizza pie of peace ire
for a solution I knew I should've
realized quickly when I tasted that first slice of man
this brotherhood of pal

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I weep in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high then wide
and I shout from the top of my lungs ire full
what's going on here tonight ire full
our pizza

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyeyey ire full
heyeyeyey ire full
I said hey what's going on here
heyeyeyey ire full ire full ire
hey what's this
pineapple on my pizza pie

[Bridge]
ooh o

ooh uh hum
ooh o

[Verse 2]
and I pine
oh my god do I pine
I pine all the time
in this frustration ire
and I ple
e oh my god do I
plee every single day ire
for revolution

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I weep in the morning and I step outside
and I take a deep breath and I get real high then wide
and I shout from the top of my lungs ire full
what's going on here tonight ire full
our pizza

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyeyey ire full
heyeyeyey ire full
I said hey what's this on here
heyeyeyey ire full ire full ire
hey what's this
pineapple on my pizza pie
and I say heyeyeyey ire full

[Outro]
twenty years and my life is
trying to get up that great big hill of hope
for a solution ire full
