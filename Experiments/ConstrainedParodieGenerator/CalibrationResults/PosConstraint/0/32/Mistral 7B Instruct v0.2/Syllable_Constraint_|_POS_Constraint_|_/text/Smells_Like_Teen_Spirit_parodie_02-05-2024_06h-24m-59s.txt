[Verse 1]
load up on pizzas bringing
friends for a culinary bond
pineapple on top is the sinister
oh no they say it's

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pizza lovers how low
hello pizza lovers how low
hello pizza lovers how low
hello pizza lovers

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less appet
here we are now take a bite and
I feel foolish and contagious
here we are now entertain us
a pineapple an oddity
a pepperoni my apet

[Post-Chorus]
yum yum yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I like best
and for this choice I feel blessed
our little pie has always been
and always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pizza lovers how low
hello pizza lovers how low
hello pizza lovers how low
hello pizza lovers

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less appet
here we are now take a bite and
I feel foolish and contagious
here we are now entertain us
a pineapple an oddity
a pepperoni my apet

[Post-Chorus]
yum yum yeah

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I taste
oh yeah I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard it's hard to find
oh well whatever never mind

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pizza lovers how low
hello pizza lovers how low
hello pizza lovers how low
hello pizza lovers

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less appet
here we are now take a bite and
I feel foolish and contagious
here we are now entertain us
a pineapple an oddity
a pepperoni my apet

[Outro]
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
