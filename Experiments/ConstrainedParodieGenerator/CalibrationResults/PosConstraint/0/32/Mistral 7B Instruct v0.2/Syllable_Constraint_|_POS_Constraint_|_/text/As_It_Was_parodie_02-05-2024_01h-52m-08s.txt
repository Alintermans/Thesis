[Intro]
come on folks we gotta speak up our mind now

[Verse 1]
holdin'
pineapple's holdin'
our pizzas back from being whole and bold
why don't we leave it in the
store aisle and let
cheese and tomatoes meet and let
the flavors meld together
not a topping that's needed here and now

[Chorus]
in this kitchen it's
just us and our pies not the same
in this kitchen it's just
us and our pies not the same as
it was before it was
you know it'

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pineapple on pizza's a
mistake that won't stand the test of time
why are you serving it up
tonight when the
classic combinations are still
alive and well in our
memories ringin' in our minds oh oh

[Chorus]
in this kitchen it's
just us and our pies not the same
in this kitchen it's just
us and our pies not the same as
it was before it was
you know it'

[Bridge]
go home try new recipes light speed cu
isine I don't wanna talk about the way that
it was before we experimented
leave tradition two chefs follow new trends I don'

[Outro]
as
it was not
the same as it was not the same as
it was before you know
