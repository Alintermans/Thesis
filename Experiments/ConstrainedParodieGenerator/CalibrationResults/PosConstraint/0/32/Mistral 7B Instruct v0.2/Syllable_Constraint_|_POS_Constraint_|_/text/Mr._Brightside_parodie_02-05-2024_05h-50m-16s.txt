[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta hide from the sun because I hate pineap
it started out on a pie so sweet and divine how did
it end up on my pizza making me cringe and
now I'm fallin' asleep and they're slicing it up
while I'm watchin' in horror and my stomach's up
now they're savourin' each bite and my heart is sick
and it's all in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savourin'
they're savourin' each bite
let me go
'cause I just can't look it's
drivin' me

[Chorus]
pineapplesity turnin'
foodies into the sea of
regret and dismay we're swim
ming through sick pineapple lies
chokin' on your excuses
but it's just the price I pay
pineapple's callin

[Guitar Solo]
