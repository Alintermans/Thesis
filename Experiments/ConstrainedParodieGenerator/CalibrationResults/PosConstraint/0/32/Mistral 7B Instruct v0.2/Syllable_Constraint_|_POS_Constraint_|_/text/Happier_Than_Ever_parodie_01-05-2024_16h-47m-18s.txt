[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
it feels so out of sight

[Verse 1]
give it a day or two to ponder what's cleverer
to create a recipe
to tell me what to bee
do you taste my pizzas fine
or do you ignore the pine line
when you said you'd pass on by with
a pepperoni delight
I knew when I asked you to try it beside us
you'd do the opposite and ruin the
topping combination we'd chosen with our eyes closed in delight
I knew when I asked you to
be cool about our cul
inary creations you'd do the opposite and
add that unwanted pineapple

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now our pizza
is better than ever before wish I could explain
it better to you but it's a fact we all know it's
not true mmhmmm oh pineapple

[Verse 2]
you call me again with a slice in
your hand trying to persuade me to
give it a chance but I'm wasting my breath you
only listen to your fellow foodies
I don't taste like you
I don't taste like you no no
'cause I'd never top my pizza this
shoddily you made me hate

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk trash about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's just embarrassing you were my favorite
topping but all that you did was make me sad
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you ruined a dish
but I'd have an empty line because you never did
never paid any mind to my sauce and cheese so I shut
them all out for you because I was a kid

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just leave me alone pineapple nope no
ah
goddam
ah
nope no
nope no
