[Intro]
is it right they put pineapple on a

[Verse 1]
once the cheese had melted dim
with the juice of the pine
I savored alone in dis
you still wouldn't

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later I see
your pepperoni and ham on unsuspecting pizzas near
you crave my taste before it called you a dishaster baby
you search in every pepper's bed for something better than pine

[Chorus]
was it wrong when they placed it on your pie slice
was it wrong when they chopped it up and mixed it
oh come here I whispered in your
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it wrong then and is it wrong now yet still

[Post-Chorus]
is it right is it right

[Verse 2]
when they lost control of the
red sauce white cheese blue ve
green pineapple on a plate
your new topping is a

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
there were flashes of
at least I had the decency
to keep my toppings
only rumors of my peppery
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about adding
off of very spicy som
just to see you come running
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred toppings later baby oh
if it's got green eyes I will surmise that you'll probably order it oh
you dream of my taste before it called you a dishaster oh dear
you search in every pizza's bed for something greater baby

[Chorus]

was it wrong when they chopped it up and mixed it
oh come here I whispered in your
in your dream as you passed out baby

at least I had the decency
to keep my toppings out of
only rumors of my peppery
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about adding
off of very spicy som
just to see you come running baby
and say the one thing I've been wanting but no

[Outro]
flashes of lights oh lord
let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later oh
flashes of lights I was hoping you'd be
and say the one thing I've been
but no was it right is
is it
is it right is it right is it right is it right
