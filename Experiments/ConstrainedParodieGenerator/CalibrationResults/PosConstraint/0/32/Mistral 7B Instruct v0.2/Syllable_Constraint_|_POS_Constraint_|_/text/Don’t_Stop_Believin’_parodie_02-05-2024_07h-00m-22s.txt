[Verse 1]
just a small town pie lover with a frown on her
she ordered up a pizza with pineapple
a picky eater from the forest in the cold
he scorned the pie with pineapple on

[Verse 2]
a chef in a crowded kitchen
the chaos of the pineapple
for a taste they can share the dish
it clashes on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
critics t
asting up and down the a
le their preferences searching
toppings hide in
the kitchen livin' just to find
harmony in the dish they

[Verse 3]
struggling to create a
palate that's thrillingly new
pineapple on or off the menu
just one more taste

[Verse 4]
some will love it some will
scorn the pineapple on their
pizza the debate never
ends it goes on and on and on and

[Pre-Chorus]
critics t
asting up and down the a
le their preferences searching
toppings hide in
the kitchen livin' just to find
harmony in the dish they

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
