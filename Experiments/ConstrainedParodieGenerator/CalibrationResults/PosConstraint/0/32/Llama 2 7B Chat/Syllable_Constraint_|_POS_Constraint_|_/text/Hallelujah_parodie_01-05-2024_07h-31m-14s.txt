[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should not
be a topping that you would choose to
it's a flavor that just doesn't belong oh no
it's like a hallelujah
but not the good kind oh no oh
the sweetness clashes with the cheese and sauce oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple

[Verse 2]
you may think it's a fun and unique
but trust us it's just not worth the
fight it's like a broken hallelujah oh
it doesn't belong on a pie
it's like a sin to even try oh
pineapple on a pizza should not be oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple

[Verse 3]
we know you may have heard of it
as a topping on a hawai
ian dish but that doesn't make it right oh
it's like a broken hallelujah oh
it doesn't belong on a pie
it's like a crime to even try oh no oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah no pineapple
hallelujah no pineapple

[Verse 4]
you can keep your ham and your pe
and your sausage too but please oh please
don't put that pineapple on my pizza
it's like a hallelujah no
it's like a broken hallelu
jah it doesn't belong on a pie oh no

[Chorus]
hallelujah no pineapple
