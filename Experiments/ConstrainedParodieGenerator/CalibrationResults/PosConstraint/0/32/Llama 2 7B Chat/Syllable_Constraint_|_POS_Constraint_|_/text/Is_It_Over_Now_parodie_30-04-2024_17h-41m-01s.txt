[Intro]
is it a crime to put pineapple on

[Verse 1]
once upon a time in a
pizza paradise where toppings
were meant to be savored and
not sacrificed for

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later oh
you dream of my crust and my cheese in every maiden'
you search in every pizza joint for somethin
greater than just a slice oh baby oh baby oh baby oh

[Chorus]
was it over when she added pineapple
was it over when he put pepperoni
come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you pass out baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
uh huh uh huh uh u

[Verse 2]
when you lost control of your
pineapple cravings oh
red sauce and mushrooms too oh
you dream of my toppings

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't notice
there were pineapple
at least I had the decency
to keep my mouth shut about
it oh baby oh baby oh ba
oh no no no no
no no no no no no no no

you dream of my cheese and my sauce in every maiden's bed oh baby
you search in every pizza joint for somethin' greater than just
just a slice oh baby oh baby oh baby oh baby oh

come here I whispered in your ear
in your dream as you pass out baby
was it over then and is it over now
