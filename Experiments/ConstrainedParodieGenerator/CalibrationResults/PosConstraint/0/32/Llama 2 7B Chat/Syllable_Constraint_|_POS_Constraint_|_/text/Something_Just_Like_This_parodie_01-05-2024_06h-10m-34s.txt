I've been reading books of old

and pineapple on
my pizza should not be
on that list oh no no no no no no no no no

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said where d'you wanna go how
much you wanna risk I
don't want pineapple on mine
not looking for someone with
superhuman taste
some fairytale to
just something I can turn to
somebody I can che
disagree with me oh no

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just
like this oh I want

like this oh I want something just
like this oh I want something
