[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pie
my taste buds disagree with the crime
it's a fruit that doesn't belong on
a savory dish like pizza
it's like putting ketchup on a
steak and expecting it
to taste like a treat instead of a
mistake it's a no from
me when it comes to pineapple on
pizza don't even get me
started on the spelling of the word
pineapple should be spelled with an e
at the end not an a it
just doesn't look right to me and
besides it doesn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh oh
amen amen

[Chorus]
don't take me
to the pizza place with the pineapple on top
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of my taste
I'll tell you my toppings and
you can sharpen your knife but please don
don't make me
eat that sweet and sour mix it's a no from me
when it comes to pineapple on pizza don't
even get me started on
the spelling of the word it's just not

[Verse 2]
I know some people might say it's a
trendy and exotic
but to me it's just a no go
I'll stick to my pepperon
and mushroom thank you very much
I don't want my pizza to
taste like a tropical vac
I'll leave that for my dessert
I'll take my pizza
like a good old fashioned pie with
no pineapple in

[Chorus]
don't take me
to the pizza place with the pineapple on top
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of my taste
I'll tell you my toppings and
you can sharpen your knife but please don
don't make me
eat that sweet and sour mix it's a no from me
when it comes to pineapple on pizza don't
even get me started on
the spelling of the word it's just not

[Bridge]
I know some people might say it's a fun and exc
novelty but to me it's just a no go I'll stick
to my classic toppings thank you very much don
t want my pizza to taste like a tropical vac

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh oh oh
amen amen

[Chorus]
don't take me
to the pizza place with the pineapple on top
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of my taste
I'll tell you my toppings and
you can sharpen your knife but please don
don't make me
eat that sweet and sour mix it's a no from me
when it comes to pineapple on pizza don't
even get me started on
the spelling of the word it's just not
