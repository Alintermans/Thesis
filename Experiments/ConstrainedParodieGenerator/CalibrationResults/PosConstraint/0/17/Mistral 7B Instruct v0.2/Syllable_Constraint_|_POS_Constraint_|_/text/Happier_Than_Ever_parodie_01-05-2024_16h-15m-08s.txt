[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our combined delicious
harder for me to carry on
wish I could explain it

[Verse 1]
try I might to find a reason amusing within
to justify your presence
on this savory dinner
do they celebrate our
combination in their dining
where my beloved me meeteth pine
I knew when I asked you to
be subtle with the toppings we're choosing you'd do
and I'd end up feeling quite surprised it
your beloved goat cheese replaced with this pine would be delightful was it
or your supposed compromise
making even sour cream
your just disagreeing instead sad with my ruined
late into our even ing

[Chorus]
why pineapple's not on our pizza our
our supposed enjoyable harmony instead
harder us apart remember what first brought me winning feeling
wish I could explain it right

[Verse 2]
your added my favoritefood
turn onto villainy through these lines
my loved herbs and spices and me confused tossed
into your seemingly heaven deceived
our shared late heated up
our desired together
in your supposed better dining
my appreciated me

[Verse 3]
and our shared oven wouldn touched since our inception
long will others voices silent ical
though all time to questionings us might we share tastes
but this on my repeated asking faded
how are so could these actions I embrace
and ruin so love's intended we
my beloved mustard or olive oils on my beloved toppings
and your supposed dedication this empty dish with
just keep this forgotten out us share but ours before
enemy it these to as our supposed

[Outro]
your forced existence changes
time taken my valued eating be
