[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a

flack from the pepperoni and
sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched and
on his breath jack he's a pineapple addict and
she just wants to exact revenge and get back at
it's a chess match she's on his back like a
jetpack and she's kept track of all his pizza toppings and
guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next and I know she
'cause she loves danger
psychopath and you don't fuck with no man's toppings she
care but she's devised some plan to top him in the

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand it
was come sunlight scram now we huff and puff and and
he found out now she feels deserted and used
'cause he left so what he did it first to her too
now how am I supposed to tell this pizza that we
don't want it no more don't take it personal
I just can't say this in person to you so I turn
to the studio like hole in the wall diners don't have to be res
reserved in a booth I just feel like the person who I'm turning to
irreversible I preyed on you like
it's church at the pew and now that I got you I don
don't want you took advantage in my thirst to pursue and
now that I got you I don't want you to
use protection before I bite into
your forbidden toppings and fuck did
I know I'm a pineapple on a pizza should
not be a sin been a topping for some
meat and cheese ought not to
be a crime all my toppings need holy wa
water washing over me well little pizza pie I don

gonna cause a fuss and

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the pepperoni never the
piece hey fuck can I say if life was a
pizza and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in
five lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin' on ice
maybe that's why I may have came at you
sideways but I can't keep
my lies straight but I made you terminate
my pizza toppings this love triangle left us
tangled what else can I say it was fun for
a while bet I really woulda loved
your toppings didn't really wanna abort
but fuck it what's one more lie to tell our

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a sin
been a topping for some meat and cheese ought not to be a crime

I don't want to admit to
something if it's just gonna cause a fuss and the
