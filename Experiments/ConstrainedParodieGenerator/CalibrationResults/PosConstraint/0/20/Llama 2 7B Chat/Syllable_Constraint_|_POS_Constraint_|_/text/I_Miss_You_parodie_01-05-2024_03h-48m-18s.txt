[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the fruit from hawaii in
the topping that we never wanted to
the flavor that we never
asked for in a pizza
it's like a vacation in every slice
but we don't want to go
we'll have pizza on pizza if we
want to live in a world of regret and
sadness in the valley

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the cheese we thought we had
the toppings we never knew we needed
the flavors we never tasted
the pineapple that
we never asked for in a pizza piece of
individuality
and uniqueness in a world
of uniformity and conform
and as we stare at the pizza
we counted the slices of
discontent and disappointment in the
midst of a pizza

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza don't waste your
time on pineapple on
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza don't waste your
time on pineapple on

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza don't waste your
time on pineapple on
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza don't waste your
time on pineapple on
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza don't waste your
time on pineapple on
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza don't waste your
time on pineapple on

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
