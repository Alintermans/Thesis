[Verse 1]
have you got a taste for something
that's not on a pizza plate oh no not on a pizza
do you ever get that feeling that you
can't escape the cheesy fate
are there some toppings you dislike so much
that you can't even take a bite oh no not on
a pizza that's got pineapple
on it no no no
how can you do this to me oh pineapple on a pizza
it's like a crime against culinary decree

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this abomination
is something you'd like to show me oh no not on a
pizza that's got pineapple on it no way no
do you want me to crawl back to you oh pineapple

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to you
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
busy bein' wrong
to fall for something so wrong
now I've thought it through
crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
for something that's not a crime to waste oh
do you ever get that feeling that you're in
a pizza paradise without pineapple in sight oh
are there some toppings you dislike so much oh no not on a
pizza that's got pineapple on it no no no not
on a pizza that's got pineapple on it no

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this abomination
is something you'd like to show me oh no not on a
pizza that's got pineapple on it no way no
do you want me to crawl back to you oh pineapple

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to you ever thought of call
when you've had a few maybe
I'm too busy bein' wrong
to fall for something so wrong now I
thought It through crawlin' back to you do I

[Outro]
