[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping frenzy with no escape from reality
open your eyeswide seeing a pineapple
I'm just a poor chef I need no sympathy
because I'm easy peel easy go little high little low
any way the sauce flows doesn't really matter to me to me

[Verse 1]
papa just ordered a
pineapple on his pizza pie placed it right there in the
papa culinary dreams
but now I've gone and ruined it all so
papa ooh didnt mean to make you sigh if
I'm not back again this time tomorrow spare
onions and olives carry on as if nothing really

[Verse 2]
too late my creation
sends shivers down my spine pizza aching all the time
goodbye pizza lovers I've got to
go gotta leave you all behind and face the
papa ooh any way the sauce flows

il I sometimes wish I'd never added pine
