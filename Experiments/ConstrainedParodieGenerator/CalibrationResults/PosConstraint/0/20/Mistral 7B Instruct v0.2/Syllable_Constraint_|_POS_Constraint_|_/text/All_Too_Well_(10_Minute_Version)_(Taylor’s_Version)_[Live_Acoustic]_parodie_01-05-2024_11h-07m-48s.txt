[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it felt like a mistake
and I left my pizza there with pineapple
and you've still got it in your fridge now looking

[Verse 2]
oh your sweet disposition and my puzzled gaze coll
we're arguing in the kitchen about this
pineapple on a pizza pie falls apart like
and I can picture it after all these nights

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little kitchen
floor you almost choked on your slice because you were grimacing
pineapple in your hair it
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter our debate was heating
up you used to be a pineapple hater in a single bed dream
and your family's laughing stories about you on the pe
you told me about your past believing pineapple
was the key to a perfect pizza pie but now you see me
regretfully tossing away the pineapple
and I was thinking on the drive home wondering al
he's gonna say it's a mistake you never called it what
it was till we were dead and gone
'til we were dead and gone and buried checking the
pineapple for a sign of
life but all I felt was disappointment and you held me
with a look of regret and dismay oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
pineapple light down the
stairs I remember it all too
well wind in my hair you were there I remember it
all too well pineapple in my hair you were there I was
there down the stairs I was
there I remember it all too well

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you added pineap
ple to it running scared
I was there I remember it
all too well and you call me up again just to argue with
me so stubbornly in the name of traditionally right
I'm a disappointed piece of pizza lying
here because I remember it

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you change the recipe
you said if we had agreed on the pineapple maybe it would have
been fine but that made me want
to throw it all away and that made me want
to throw it all away and that made me want to throw it all away and
that made me want to throw it all way
and then you wondered where it went to as
I reached for the pine
apple but all I felt was disappointment
and you held my lifeless frame oh oh oh oh oh
and I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could
do and I forget about you long enough to forget

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after pepperoni days and nights when you made me
your own now you serve me pineapple and I walk
alone but you keep my old pizza from that first
week because it reminds you of innocence and it
smells like me you can't get
rid of it because you remember

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
pineapple in my hair you
were there I remember
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapple stays the
same from when your pepperoni broke the
rules and bones I'm a soldier who's returning
half the calories you asked for but
did the pineapple top burn you too did the love
affair leave a mark on you
'cause in this kitchen's barren cold I still
remember the first fall of snow
and how it glistened as it fell

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair burn you all too well
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well pineapple in
my hair I was there I was there down the
stairs I was there I was there sacred
prayer I was there I was there it was
rare you remember it all too well pineap
ple in my hair I was there I was there
down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it
pineapple in my hair I was there was
there sacred prayer I was there I was
there it was rare you remember it
pineapple in my hair I was
there down the stairs I was there I was there
sacred prayer I was there I was there
it was rare you remember it all
too well pineapple in my hair I was there

[Spoken Outro]
