[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
wishing it was out of

[Verse 1]
give me a slice or two to ponder something brighter
to create a recipe
to tell me what to put near
do you read my recipes
or do you ignore my decree
when you said you loved pineapple
was I even on your plate
I knew when I asked you to spare it dearer than
a traditional pepperoni pair
you'd do the opposite of what you'd swear you'd do we'd
end up with a bitter taste
don't say it's a fair share
you clearly weren't aware that you ruined our
pizza paradise so if you

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now our pizza
is better than ever before wish I could explain
it better we'd all be in agreement I wish it wasn't true
mm hm hm hm hm hm ha

[Verse 2]
you call me again proclaiming pine
as the perfect topping for your pie
you scared me to death with your insistence strong
but I'm wasting my breath on a lost cause
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
'cause I'd never treat our pizza
this way you made me hate this

[Verse 3]
and I don't post memes about you online bashing
pineapple's place on our pizza scene
'cause that's just embarrassing it was once my all time
favorite dish but now it just makes me feel
disgusted and ashamed so don't waste
the time I don't have and don't
try to make me feel ashamed of my choice I could talk about
every time that you respected my wishes but
I'd have an empty line since you never did respect mine
respecting my mother and friends instead of

[Outro]
you ruined our perfect
combination always said you were
unique but made all our
moments a disappointment just leave us
al
one al
ah
alone
yes pine
