[Verse 1]
just stop your whining it's a
sign of the pineapple times
welcome to the final slice of
pizza's ultimate demise accordin' to some
you look quite tasty here but
pineapple ain't really

[Pre-Chorus]
we never ordered right we've been here
before why are we always arguing
over fruit on our
pizza pies we never learn why are
we always arguing over fruit on
our pizza pies we

[Chorus]
just stop your whining it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
just stop your whining it'll be fine they
said pineapple's just a flavor
we gotta get away from here

[Verse 2]
just stop your whining have the taste of your life
breaking through the savory
atmosphere things look pretty
good from here remember every bite
will be alright we can meet
again somewhere somewhere far

[Pre-Chorus]
we never ordered right we've been here
before why are we always arguing
over fruit on our
pizza pies we never learn why are
we always arguing over fruit on
our pizza pies we

[Chorus]
away from here where the cheese and sauce align
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
stop your whining baby it'll be fine they
said pineapple's just a flavor
we gotta get away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
we never ordered right we've been here
before why are we always arguing
over fruit on our
pizza pies we never learn why are
we always arguing over fruit on
our pizza pies we

[Bridge]
we don't discuss the
toppings enough we
should open up before
it's all too much will
we ever learn we
have been here before

[Outro]
stop your whining baby it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to get away we got to get away
we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
we got to we got to away
