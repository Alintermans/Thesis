He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar serving a\npineapple on a pizza\nbeen a lover of tradition and a hater of the new\nall my taste buds need cleansing water to rinse away the\nmystery fruit on my pizza\nwell little one I don't want to admit to\nchanging the recipe\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's bringing pineapple home for a taste test\npepperoni and sausage in\ndressings that clash and don't impress\nbut she just wants to experiment and impress\nit's a culinary clash she's on a mission\nshe's kept track of all his past orders and\nguess who just happens to be moving on to the next dish\nactually just adding pineapple to his pizza and she has\nwhat his traditional pal\nbut she's devised some plan to change his taste preferences\nknife in hand says their pizza's hangin' by a thread\nso she's been on the web lately researching new flavors\nsays maybe she'll be my pepper\nand I know she's using me to try to play him but\nhi suzanne I should've said goodbye suzanne after the first\nbite I am but tonight I am part of the\nforbidden pineapple pie team and she\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar serving a\npineapple on a pizza\nbeen a lover of tradition and a hater of the new\nall my taste buds need cleansing water to rinse away the\nmystery fruit on my pizza\nwell little one I don't want to admit to\nchanging the recipe\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na simple pizza turned a complex one\nit was come toppings sunrise now we argue and\nhe found out now she feels disrespected and\nused because he took away her favorite\nnow how am I supposed to tell this person that we\ncan't serve pineapple on our pizza again\nit's hard to find the words I'm aloof and nervous and sue\ndon't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth and respect for\nour culinary past and traditions we built together but\nI revert to the kitchen like a hole\nin the wall pizzeria and I just feel like the\nperson I'm becoming is irreversible I abused\nthe trust you put in me and now our love\nfeels like a burnt pizza left in the heat\nwhy do I do this act that I do\nget on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech\npineapple and cheese is burning the bond\n'cause now with our love in\nthe oven we can't bring it to the world\nshoulda used toppings before I bit into your forbidden\ntop\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's ooh my name's o\npizza\no\nh river\nrunning water over\npizza pie we'll let the\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the traditionalist never\nthe innovator hey I can't say\nbut I made you terminate our pizza creations\nthis love for pineapple left us in a mess tangled\nwhat else can I say it was fun for a\nwhile but I really would've\nloved your traditional smile did I dare\nto abort our pizza traditions for a\nnew ingredient or two or three or four\nor five or six or seven or eight\nor nine or ten or eleven or twelve or\nthirteen or fourteen or fifteen or sixteen\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar serving a\npineapple on a pizza\nbeen a lover of tradition and a hater of the new\nall my taste bud\ns need cle\n\nansing wa ter to rinse away the mis\ntery fruit\n\non my pizza well little one\nI don't want to admit to changing the rec\n",
