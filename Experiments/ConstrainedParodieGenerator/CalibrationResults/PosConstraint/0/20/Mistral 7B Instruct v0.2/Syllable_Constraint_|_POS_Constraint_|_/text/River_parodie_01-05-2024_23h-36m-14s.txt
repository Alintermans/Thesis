[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar serving a
pineapple on a pizza
been a lover of tradition and a hater of the new
all my taste buds need cleansing water to rinse away the
mystery fruit on my pizza
well little one I don't want to admit to
changing the recipe

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's bringing pineapple home for a taste test
pepperoni and sausage in
dressings that clash and don't impress
but she just wants to experiment and impress
it's a culinary clash she's on a mission
she's kept track of all his past orders and
guess who just happens to be moving on to the next dish
actually just adding pineapple to his pizza and she has
what his traditional pal
but she's devised some plan to change his taste preferences
knife in hand says their pizza's hangin' by a thread
so she's been on the web lately researching new flavors
says maybe she'll be my pepper
and I know she's using me to try to play him but
hi suzanne I should've said goodbye suzanne after the first
bite I am but tonight I am part of the
forbidden pineapple pie team and she

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar serving a
pineapple on a pizza
been a lover of tradition and a hater of the new
all my taste buds need cleansing water to rinse away the
mystery fruit on my pizza
well little one I don't want to admit to
changing the recipe

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a simple pizza turned a complex one
it was come toppings sunrise now we argue and
he found out now she feels disrespected and
used because he took away her favorite
now how am I supposed to tell this person that we
can't serve pineapple on our pizza again
it's hard to find the words I'm aloof and nervous and sue
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth and respect for
our culinary past and traditions we built together but
I revert to the kitchen like a hole
in the wall pizzeria and I just feel like the
person I'm becoming is irreversible I abused
the trust you put in me and now our love
feels like a burnt pizza left in the heat
why do I do this act that I do
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
pineapple and cheese is burning the bond
'cause now with our love in
the oven we can't bring it to the world
shoulda used toppings before I bit into your forbidden
top

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar serving a
pineapple on a pizza
been a lover of tradition and a hater of the new
all my taste buds need cleansing water to rinse away the
mystery fruit on my pizza
well little one I don't want to admit to

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the traditionalist never
the innovator hey I can't say
but I made you terminate our pizza creations
this love for pineapple left us in a mess tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a
while but I really would've
loved your traditional smile did I dare
to abort our pizza traditions for a
new ingredient or two or three or four
or five or six or seven or eight
or nine or ten or eleven or twelve or
thirteen or fourteen or fifteen or sixteen
