[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pineapple on my pie
the unwelcome guest atop the pizza
the unsuspecting palate
of clashing flavors in the
kitchen of despair we share if we want it
where you can always find me
and we'll have harmony on pizza
and in the slice we'll wish this never ends
we'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where are you and I'm so sorry
I cannot taste my pizza now tonight
I need something savory and
this sick pineapple
comes creeping on with its sweetness haunting me
and as I bite I counted
the juice from all the pineap
dripping down and mixing with the sauce
like indecisiveness to call
for a new topping on the
pizza pie will you come home and stop this
this pineapple pain

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't top your pie with me you're already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
