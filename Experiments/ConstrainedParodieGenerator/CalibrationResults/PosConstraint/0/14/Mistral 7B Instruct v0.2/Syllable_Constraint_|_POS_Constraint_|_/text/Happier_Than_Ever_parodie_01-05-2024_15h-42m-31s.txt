[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
wishing it was out of

[Verse 1]
give me a slice or two to ponder something tasty
to create a recipe
to tell me what to beebe
do you read my articles
or do you ignore my decree
when you said you loved pineapple
was I even on your plate
I knew when I asked you to spice it up a bit
you'd add it without a pitiful fit
you'd ignore my pleas and ruin it with a twist of fruit so bitter
so if you really wanna
make our pizza great once
my suggestion is quite simple and easy to pron
just leave the pineapple out at

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on us now we're happier
our pizza tastes better than ever before wish
we could explain it better to the world around us we wish it
wasn't true but pineapple

[Verse 2]
you call me again with a piney
obsession in your eyesight demean
you horrify me to death but I'm
wasting my breath on a lost cause' see
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you no
'cause I'd never top our pizza
with something so unappet

[Verse 3]
and I don't defend pineapple on the internet
never told anyone anything good
'cause that's just embarrassing our pizza was once
a masterpiece but now it's ruined by a
fruit that doesn't belong don't waste the
time I don't have and don't make
me feel bad for wanting to enjoy my meal in peace I could
talk about every time that you added pineap
please but I'd have an empty slice because you never did
respect my wishes and the taste of our

[Outro]
you ruined our perfect
pizza with your misunderstanding
made all our memories
just pineapple and cheese leave us alone
yes
yes please
ah
pineap
leaves us
