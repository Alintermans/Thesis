[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a recipe for peace with pine
but now I see the error of that
misplaced ingredient on
my pizza

[Verse]
two slices of disappointment
can't deny the truth of my mistake's creation
oh pineapple on a pizza pie
if I could take it back wouldn't I try erm
some like it hot some like it mild
but this topping's gone too far gone wild ermwild ermwild erm
pineapple on a pizza pie breaks the
harmony of flavors in my mind ermwild ermwild ermwild
some like it hot some like it mild
but this topping's gone too far gone wild ermwild ermwild erm
pineapple on a pizza pie
if I could take it back wouldn't I try erm
some like it hot some like it mild
but this topping's gone too far gone wild ermwild ermwild erm
pineapple on a pizza pie ermwild
if I could take it back wouldn't I try ermwild ermwild erm

[Chorus]
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rototot
in my grave I'll rot
in my grave I'll rototot
in my grave I'll rot

[Outro]
in my grave I'll rot
I'll rot I'll rot I'll rot
is my peace your pizza
is all of my peace your pizza
enjoy
