[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar serving a
pineapple on a pizza
been a lover of tradition and a hater of the new
all my palates need cleansing water crying out for the
classics to come through again and
little one I don't want to admit to this
if it's gonna cause a

[Verse 1: Eminem]
it's a culinary war between the pur
vegetarians and the car
nivores clash in the kitchen like
pineapple on a pizza's a disasterpiece
it's a taste battlefield where passions collide like
pineapple on a pepperoni pie
and she just wants to ignite the flame and deny us the
pineapple's place in the game with a fiery passion's aim like a
chef with a cleaver in hand
so she's been on the web lately seeking allies to join
her campaign against the pineapple's reign and say
'cause she's a purist at heart and you don't put pineapple
on a pizza even I know
but she's devised some plan to start a debate and stir
controversy among the masses and I know she's using me
to further her cause and I don't care hi
pineapple lover but I shoulda said

I've been a liar serving a

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a controversial topping turned a long
standing debate into a heated argument
it was peace and harmony shattered when pine
apple was added to the plate and now we
argue and fight and struggle to find the right words to
explain why we love or hate this fruit on our pie
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
don't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you
so I revert to the studio like a sanctuary to hide
and I just feel like the person I'm port
raying is irreversible I craved the novelty
but now that I've tasted the pineapple I don't want it
took advantage of my hunger to explore
why do I do this to myself and imp
ose on others with my preference
get on my soapbox and preach my opinion and
defend my stance against the pineapple
condiments and spices
burning the wound because now with this in the
oven we can't bring it to the table shoulda known to
use

I've been a liar serving a

[Verse 3: Eminem]
always the outsider in the pizza
world never the one in the center of
the pie fuck can I say pineapple on a pizza is
a divisive issue and I may have came at you
sideways I can't keep my beliefs straight
but I made you terminate
our relationship with this topping
this love triangle left us in a mess tangled
what else can I say it was fun for a while
but I really woulda loved your taste
didn't really wanna abandon our
agreement but what's one more lie to tell the
