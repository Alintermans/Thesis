[Verse 1]
first things first
I'll rant about this fruit on my pie dish
pineapple on pizza's a curse
it's a taste that just won't pers
a taste that just won't persist

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't you argue with me about this trendy
topping on my pizza
I'm the one who's picky and cheesy
the master of my pizza's le

[Pre-Chorus]
I was served a slice with surprise
pineapple on top was a disgu
saving my palate for the few
who share my disdain and shook at you singin' the blues
pining for the days of olden
when pizza was savory and
had no place for this tropical
interloper that stole the spot

[Chorus]
painstakingly wrong you made me see
pineapple believer
painful to taste you bring me down then
pineapple believer
painstakingly wrong you made me try it out
my love for pizza it came from the
pineapple believer in me now
pineapple believer

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a prayer to the pizza gods up
above that pineapple
won't be on my pizza evermore
our tastebuds up above

[Pre-Chorus]
I was driven to despair
by the sight of pineapple there
craving for the days that were rare
when my pizza tasted pure and
cheesy and savory no more interloper to
be found on my plate or in my mind it's rained down painfully
on my pizza

[Chorus]
painstakingly wrong you made me see
pineapple believer
painful to taste you bring me down then
pineapple believer
painstakingly wrong you made me try it out
my love for pizza it came from the
pineapple believer in me now
pineapple believer

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the fire and the flames
you're the face of the future
the sauce in my veins oh oh
the sauce in my veins oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's rained down painfully on my pizza plate and
pineapple believer in me now it's rained down painfully
on my pizza

[Chorus]
painstakingly wrong you made me see
pineapple believer
painful to taste you bring me down then
pineapple believer
painstakingly wrong you made me try it out
my love for pizza it came from the
pineapple believer in me now
pineapple believer
