[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
she's the pineapple at the table
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've spoken up before
if the kitchens ever did dec
she's the last true defense
every pizza night's gettin' more
a fresh controversy
we were born picky what they say it
my oven offers no comprom
she tells me change the toppings upside
the only pizza I'll be sent to
is when I'm alone with you
I was born picky but I love
it's the pineapple on

[Pre-Chorus]
a pepper
pepperamen

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that pineapple
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that pineapple
oh good chef let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
if I'm a vegetarian of
my lover's the pizza
to keep the flavors on my side
she demands a compromise
add the whole garden get somethin
somethin' savory for the main
that's a fine lookin' palate

that looks tasty that looks fine too
this is hunger work

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that pineapple
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that pineapple
oh good chef let me give you my life

[Bridge]
no meats or cheeses when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter harmony than our gentle din
in the chaos and dough of that sad kitchen scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh pepper
pepperamen

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that pineapple
oh good chef let me give you my life
take me to the
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that pineapple
oh good chef let me give you my life
