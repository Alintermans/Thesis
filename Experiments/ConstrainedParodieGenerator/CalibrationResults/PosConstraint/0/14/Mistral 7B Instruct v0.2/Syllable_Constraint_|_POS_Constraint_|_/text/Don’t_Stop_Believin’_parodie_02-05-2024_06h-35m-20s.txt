[Verse 1]
just a small town cookin' up a curious dish
pineapple on a pizza causing quite a
a city palate with a taste so bold and new
but oh the debate rages on and on and

[Verse 2]
a chef in the kitchen with a
pineapple's sweet aroma in
for a bite they can share the cul
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
waitin' in the line at the
their palates searchin' for delight
pepperoni
livin' just to find acceptance
hiding in the pizza night

[Verse 3]
struggling to create a
everybody wants a taste
paying any price to roll the dice
just one more slice

[Verse 4]
some will savor the blend
some will turn up their nose and
oh the debate never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza lovers
waitin' in the line at the
their palates searchin' for delight
pepperoni
livin' just to find acceptance
hiding in the pizza night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
