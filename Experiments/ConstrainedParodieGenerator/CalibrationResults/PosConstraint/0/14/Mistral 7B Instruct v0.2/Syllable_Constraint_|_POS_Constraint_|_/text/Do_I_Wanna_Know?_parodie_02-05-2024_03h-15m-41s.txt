[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clashes like something
in the kitchen cabinet so
have you no idea that it's a big
mistake I've seen you make this weeknight after nightlight
how many food combinations
can you justify
'cause there's this joke I found that makes me think of you somehow an' I
replay it in my head until I fall asleep

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this combination flows
was sorta hopin' that you'd choose to avoid it though
we could agree that the nights were made for trying
new things that we can't enjoy tomorrow nightly

[Chorus]
scurrying back to
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
obsessed with being
to fall for another to
now I've thought it through
scurrying back to

[Verse 2]
have you got the courage
to admit that it's a flavor combo
that's just not worth the struggle and the trouble
simmer down and take a bite I'm sorry to interrupt
it's just I'm constantly on the edge of trying to change your
mind but I don't know if you feel the same as me
but we could agree to disagree and move on

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this combination flows
was sorta hopin' that you'd choose to avoid it though
we could agree that the nights were made for trying
new things that we can't enjoy tomorrow nightly

[Chorus]
scurrying back to you scurrying back
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a few scurry
'cause I always do scurry scurry back
maybe I'm too scurrying back to be
obsessed with being yours to fall
scurrying back to you now
scurrying back to
scurrying back to

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this combination flows
was sorta hopin' that you'd choose to avoid it though
we could agree that the nights were made for trying
new things that we can't enjoy tomorrow nightly
do I wanna know too busy bein' yours to fall
ever thought of ordering something new darlin' do
do I wanna know do you want me scurrying back to
