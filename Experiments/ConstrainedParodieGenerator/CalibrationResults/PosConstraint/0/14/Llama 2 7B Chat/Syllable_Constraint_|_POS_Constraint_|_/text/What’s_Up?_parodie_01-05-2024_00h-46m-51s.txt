[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
it's a crime against humanity somehow
for a topping so sweet
it's like a sugary disease in dis
for a dish that's meant to be neatly crafted with care
not a fruit that should be

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I'm feeling a little peculiar about
pineapple on a pizza being fed to my head
and I wake in the morning and I step wide
and I take a deep breath and I get
really anno

[Chorus]
and I say pineapple
pineapple
I said pineapple what's going
on a pizza oh no
pineapple
I said pineapple what's going

[Bridge]

oh no

oh no no

[Verse 2]
I try to
oh my goodness do they
I try to avoid
this abomination
on a pie
that's meant to be savored
not something that's gonna make me
wanna vomit blood

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I'm feeling a little peculiar about
pineapple on a pizza being fed to my head
and I wake in the morning and I step wide
and I take a deep breath and I get
really anno

[Chorus]
and I say pineapple
pineapple
I said pineapple what's gone
on a pizza oh no
pineapple
I said pineapple what's gone wrong
with the world today oh

oh no no
oh no no no no no no no no

[Bridge]

[Outro]
twenty five years and my life
still trying to get up that great big hill of
hope for a destination
