[Intro]
I think I've finally found a way
to explain why pineapple doesn
should never be on a pizza in
any way possible please
you agree

[Verse]
I've tasted the sweetest of to
the juiciest of fruits in my time on this earthly plane
but pineapple on a pizza is
like a crime against humanity in a
crime against humanity in
a heinous act that cannot be justified by any
moral or ethical standard in the
history of culinary atrocities committed
against the sacred tradition
of pizza making itself I must say with a heavy
heart and a strong sense of conviction

no matter how you slice it or
how you justify it or try to rationalize it

you to join me in this fight against this foul abomina

[Chorus]
pineapple on a
pineapple on a
pineapple on a pizza
no no no no no
no no no no no no no
pineapple on a

[Outro]
so let us stand un
united in our
opposition to this
gastronomical blasphemy
and fight
