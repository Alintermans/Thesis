[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the fruit from hawaii in
the topping that we never wanted to
the flavor that we never
asked for or needed in a
pizza that's already too much to handle
we can live without the sweet
and the juice that stains our hands and
floors and clothes and everything we own that
is already too much

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where is the balance in life when
we add something that doesn't belong on
a pie that's already too much
a savory and
sweet combination that just doesn't work in
the flavors that we know and
love and enjoy and crave and
can't be replaced by something that
tastes like a tropical island
when we have so much more to
lose than to gain with pineapple on a
pizza that's just not

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your toppings on me you're always
the voice inside our
head saying no to the
pineapple that we never wanted or asked
for in the first place don
t waste your toppings on

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't waste your toppings on me you're always
the voice inside our
head saying no to the
pineapple that we never wanted or asked
for in the first place don
t waste your toppings on
don't waste your time on pineapple on a
pizza that's already
too much to handle don
t waste your time on pineapple on a it
pizza that's already
too much to handle don

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
I miss pineapple on
