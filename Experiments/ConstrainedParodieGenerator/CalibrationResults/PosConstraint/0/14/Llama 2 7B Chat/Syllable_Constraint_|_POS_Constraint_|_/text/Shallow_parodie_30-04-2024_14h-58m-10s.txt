[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza should not be the thing to do
it's a crime against
good taste and tradition too oh no

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
we're falling
in the pit of pineapple despair we are
longing
for a topping that doesn't make us

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tired of the sweet
tired of the heat wave tired of the
pineapple repeat
ain't it hard to keep it real no more

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
we're falling
in the pit of pineapple despair we are
longing
for a topping that doesn't make us

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the floor
crash through the surface where the pineapple can
no more no more no more no

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the ha ha ha ha ha
in the ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
in the ha ha ha ha ha
we're far from the pineapple

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ha ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never meet the floor
crash through the surface where the pineapple can
no more no more no more no

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
we're off the deep end watch
as we dive in we'll never meet the
floor crash through the surface
where the pineapple can't
