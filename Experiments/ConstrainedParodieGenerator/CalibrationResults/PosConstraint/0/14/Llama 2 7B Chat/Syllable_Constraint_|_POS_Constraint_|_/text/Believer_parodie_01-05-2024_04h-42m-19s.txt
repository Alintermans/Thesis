[Verse 1]
pineapple
oh no don't put it on my pizza
it's a crime against culina
the toppings are fine just the way
they are meant to be enjoyed you

[Verse 2]
second things second
don't take away my cheese please dear lord above
it's the foundation of
my pizza dreams and visions of joy
a slice of heaven in my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on margherita
taking my toppings to the masses
writing my poems for the few
that appreciate the art of pizza making them
singing from the heart of a true
believer in the cheese and sau
seeing the beauty through the pe
pepperoni and mushroom ha

[Chorus]
pineapple you ruin my pizza
you make it a fruit sal
instead of a savory delight
pineapple you take it
from my pizza sight oh no oh no oh no
my pizza my love my drive it came
from the toppings on top oh no oh
no pineapple on top

[Verse 3]
third things third
send a letter to the pizza place
tell them how you feel in
your own words and your own space please dear lord
don't put it on my pizza

[Pre-Chorus]
I was raised on margher
taking my toppings to the clouds
falling like ashes to the ground
hoping my pizza dreams they would
drown but they never did ever lived ebbin and flow
inhibited limited until it broke open and ra
rained down like a

[Chorus]
pineapple you ruin my pizza
you make it a fruit sal
instead of a savory delight
pineapple you take it
from my pizza sight oh no oh no oh no
my pizza my love my drive it came
from the toppings on top oh no oh
no pineapple on top

[Verse 4]
last things last
by the grace of the cheese and the sauce pot
you're the face of the pizza
the toppings in my belly
oh no oh no oh no oh

[Pre-Chorus]
but they never did ever lived ebbin and flowin
inhibited limited until it broke open and ra
rained down like a

[Chorus]
pineapple you ruin my pizza
you make it a fruit sal
instead of a savory delight
pineapple you take it
from my pizza sight oh no oh no oh no
my pizza my love my drive it came
from the toppings on top oh no oh
no pineapple on top
