[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza oh no no no
mama don't put it on there please don't do it
can't believe you'd even consider it
its flavor just doesn't belong on a pie
in a world full of toppings so divine open your eyes and
see the mistake that you're about to designate toppings that just

[Verse 1]
aint anymore gotta
gotta stop you from making this faux pas just can't ab
oreo cheese and pepper
but not pineapple oh no no no it
tanges fundimentally wrong just can
from your classic margherita to a meat
loads with tomatoes and onions that's the way it should be

[Verse 2]
why would you take away
take away the one topping that makes it all worthwhile
bbq chicken or add some bacon
something savory would be a delight but
plain should never be an option don
your credibility
your taste buds your very sanity are at

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
our pizza traditions must be preserved
classify pineappleas a heresy can't you
fectoberry or blueberries instead why must it be
ust when you think it can't get any worse it's pineapple on a pizza oh no no no don't do it
and your supposed friendly neighborhood local

memoryand we'll never forgive you for
such a gross affront to the culinary
