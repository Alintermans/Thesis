[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
pineapple on a pizza
a topping so divine
tropical sweetness on
flagrant disregard for
culinary dec
I can't believe it
won't fit inside my piece I want something just like

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]

how many calories
my growing waistline can handle
with each additional treat
I fear for my health
no pineapple on
my pizza I protest do
won't be satisfied
I seek something just like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
