[Intro]
keep away the pineapple from my pizza pie

[Verse 1]

it ain't the topping that I desire
why don't you check your inbox

back street is where I'd rather be
than you bringing pineapple
and your icy stares defeat me please keep

[Chorus]
in this kitchenverse it
aint got the same flavor as before
in this universe it
aint got the same flavor as before
from my rose per my rose
aint got the same flavor

[Chorus]
in this kitchenverse it
aint got the same flavor as before
in this universe it
aint got the same flavor as before
from my rose per my rose
aint got the same flavor
