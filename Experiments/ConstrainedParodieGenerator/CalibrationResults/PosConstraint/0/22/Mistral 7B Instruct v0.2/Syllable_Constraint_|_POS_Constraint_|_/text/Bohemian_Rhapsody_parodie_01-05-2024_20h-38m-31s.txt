[Intro]
is this a pizza peace is what we seekin
topperless and topped with an unwelcome pineapple
take a bite and close your eyes surrender to
I've just made a gaffe struck afood disaster
with a knife in hand traditional choice I'd cling to old ways
any leafy green or pepper can't compete with pineapple

[Verse 1]
brotherhood so tested
pressed a button next to passionfruit said it was bested
farewater bearings ag
but now I find love's true testament a
fair breeze carried away love off handed
if I'm not here again this slice tomorrow
swallow pride swallow every morsel on offer then

[Verse 2]
late deliciousness has
comes swiftly down my palate sensitivity to
bon appetite its taken going strong
must partway saying goodbye every bite
family tear a silence a part
my beloved so called to
carry on carrying on as if nothing

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I glimpse the golden circle before me sets
denizens margheritta seeking their amusement
bolts and sweetened yet so startling they me I i I we
pizzius chef savior bound by zestful decretions pleasers none elles elles elles elles elles elles
but I'm merely a low paid hater given
he's merely a low orderer from an uns
preference he he ounce ounce every
free willed fresh faced come what mayed ounce ounce sayed
won millis who have ounce put aside ounce
come our ounce way our ounce way our ounce
come our ounce way our ounce way our ounce
come our ounce way our ounce
come our way come our way
never never never never let ourself
never never never let
never never never never let go our way our way
oh mamma mia mamma mia never let our way go

[Verse 4]
so you figure it's fitting topping me with on
so your tastebuds your giving leaving me to
babe no can't stand this to my beloved be
just gotta leave ive ive ive gonna ive got to go

[Outro]
