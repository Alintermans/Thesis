[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our beloved pizza dish
I savor every bite with
an uncontrollable

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to pondersomething clever
to construct an argument
to defend my position
do you add it year after
or do your preferred choices ste
when I suggested our pie
was my suggestion even
I knew when I invited you to just tryit left
doing the opposite of your promise
your beloved pineapple would leave us in a stateof regretand dis
so if you really wanna
have a taste of harmony
we'll top our pies with herbs or veggiesinsteadof
pineapple on our pizza

[Chorus]
when pineapples gonefrom our pizza dish
my palate savors every bitewithan un
controllable delighti wish I could explain it better we
wish it weren't so true let

[Verse 2]
you advocateagainfor its place
pushy to insists upon a change
your forced preference scares me to deathbut I
as I'm wasting mybreath you value your
opinion above all else
our beloved pizza will lose
without our shared agreement
you made our traditions

[Verse 3]
and we don'tdissectthese silly debatesonlineo
never spoke insultsin someoneelse's
presencepineapple's been my companionfor
years and all it brought was upsetting our
once sharedlovemaking ever dish
