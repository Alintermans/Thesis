He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a fan of pineapple\non my pizza sent me ins\nbeen a lover of the sweet and tangy taste of it all in\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it gonna cause is pain\nmy love for pineapple now is falling like the\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's comin' home with his teeth gnashed oh so\npineapple and ham oh boy does\nthat we'll be a match made in heaven\nor so I've been told by the pepperoni ma\nI don't want to admit to something I've been\nhiding for so long pineapple on a\nbut pineapple on a pizza is like a sin in the\nchurch I can't take it anymore I must confess my love for it\nlike a guilty pleasure that\nI can't ignore pineapple on a pizza is like\na red flag to a bull I can't\navoid it any longer I must embrace it like a\nnew love in my life pineapple\non my pizza forever I don't care if it\ncauses pain to others I must be true to myself and my love\nfor pineapple on a pizza is something\nthat I can't live without so let the\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a fan of pineapple\non my pizza sent me ins\nbeen a lover of the sweet and tangy taste of it all in\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it gonna cause is pain\nmy love for pineapple now is falling like the\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI know I'm not the only one who feels\nthis way about pineapple on a pizza it\nseems like everyone has their own opinion\nlike a neverending debate that I don\njust can't participate in I don't want to\nadmit to something that could cause pain to others but\npineapple on a pizza is like a red flag to a\nbull I can't avoid it any longer I must confess my love for\nit like a guilty pleasure that I can't ignore pineapple on\na pizza is something that I can't\nlive without so let the river run I don't care\nif it causes pain to others I must be true to myself\nand my love for pineapple on a pizza\nist something that I can't ignore so\nlet the river run and let my love\nfor pineapple on a pizza be heard I don\ndont care if it causes pain to\nothers I must be true\nto myself and my love for pineapple on\na pizza forever I don't care if it causes pain\nto\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's pineapple mine\npineale\ncall\npineapple\nriver run pineapple\npizza forever I don't care\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nI know I'm not the only one who feels\nthis way about pineapple on aji\nseems like everyone has their own opinion it's like a\nneverending debate that I just can't partic\nipate in I don't want to admit\nto something that could cause pain\nto others but pineapple on aji\nis like a red flag to a bull I can't av\noid it any longer I must confess mu\nlove for it like a guilty\npleasure that I can't ignore pineapple\non a pizza is something that I can't\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a fan of pineapple\non my pizza sent me ins\nbeen a lover of the sweet and tangy taste of it all in\nwell little one\nI don't\n\nwant to admit to something if all it\ngonna cause\n\npain so let the river run let\nmy love for pineapple on a pizza be heard\n",
