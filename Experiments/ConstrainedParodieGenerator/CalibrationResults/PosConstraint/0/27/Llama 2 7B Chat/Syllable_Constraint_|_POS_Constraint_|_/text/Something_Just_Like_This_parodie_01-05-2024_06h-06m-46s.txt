[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I had a pineapple on
my pizza and it didn
didn't quite taste the same
the sweetness clashed with the
savory flavors
and now I'm singing this
song to express my painful shame doo doo doo doo do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go now that the
pineapple's gone from the
pizza scene oh how I miss its
tangy zest and the way it
brought a tropical
twist to the classic
cheesy delight doo doo do
oh how I wish it were
still there on my plate doo do

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just
like that pineapple
doo doo do
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just
like that pineapple
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh I want something just like that
pineapple on my pizza

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I tried other toppings too
but none of them felt quite
right the pepperoni
was too spicy the sa
lmon was too sour the
onions made me cry do
oh how I miss that pineapple on my pie

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go now that the
pineapple's gone from the
pizza scene oh how I miss its
tangy zest and the way it
brought a tropical
twist to the classic
cheesy delight doo doo do
oh how I wish it were

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like
that pineapple on my pie

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like that
pineapple's sweetness and
crunchiness in a
cheese sandwich or maybe
even a salad oh how nice
it would be to have it
back on my plate do
doo doo doo

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
now that the pineapple
is gone from the pizza scene oh
how I miss its tangy zip
and the way it brought
a tropical touch
to the classic cheesy treat
doo doo doo doo doo do
oh how I wish it were still

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like that
pineapple on my pizza do
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo do
