the smell of sweetness fills the
for a taste they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangles waiting
up and down the supermark
their flavors searching in the night
fruit stand people
living just to find perfection
hiding somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
working hard to get a slice
everybody wants a taste
paying anything to roll the dice

some will lose the topping race
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangles waiting
up and down the supermark
their flavors searching in the night
fruit stand people
living just to find perfection
hiding somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]

hold on to that flavor

don't stop enjoying
hold on
supermarket
don't stop enjoying
hold on to that flavor
supermarket
