pineapple
don't you dare put it on my pizza

I can't believe you'd even
consider such a heinous act

way or I'll lose my appetite
and throw a fit like a toddler in a rage goaded
seeing pineapple on my pie
makes me wanna scream and holler

[Verse 3]
third things third
make no mistake I'll fight to the death
for my right to choose what
