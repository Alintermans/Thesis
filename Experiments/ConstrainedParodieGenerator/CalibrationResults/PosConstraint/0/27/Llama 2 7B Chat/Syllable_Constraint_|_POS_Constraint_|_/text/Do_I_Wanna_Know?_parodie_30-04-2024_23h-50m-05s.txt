[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza
do you really think it's a good idea to combine
it's like putting ketchup on a
catastrophe of flavors and
texture it's just not right you see oh no
don't you know that pineapple doesn't belong
on a pizza it's like putting
a fruit salad on
a steak it's just not gonna work out you know what I mean oh
please for the love of cheese don't put pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this abomination
is something you'd be into too oh no please don't
say it ain't so it's like putting mayonnaise
on a hot dog it's just not natural you see oh

[Chorus]
crawlin' back to the
original pizza to
ever thought of

had a few too
'cause I always do oh
maybe I'm too busy be
longing for the good
old days when pineapp

[Verse 2]
back to the classic to

[Outro]
