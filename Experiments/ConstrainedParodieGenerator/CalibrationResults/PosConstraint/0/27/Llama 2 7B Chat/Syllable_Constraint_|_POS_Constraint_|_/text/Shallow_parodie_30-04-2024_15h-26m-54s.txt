[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza it's just not right oh no it
ain't gonna taste
like a sweet delight oh no it won

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
we can't
resist the urge to resist it oh no it
ain't
gonna make us lose our mind oh

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tried it before but
ain't no more we'll explore oh no it
ain't gonna make
us want it more oh no it won't no

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
we can't
resist the urge to resist it oh no it
ain't
gonna make us lose our mind oh

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
ain't never gonna
meet the pineapple again oh no it won
ain't gonna make us lose

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the ha ha ha ha ha
in the ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
in the ha ha ha ha ha
we're far from the pineapple

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ha ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
ain't never gonna
meet the pineapple again oh no it won
ain't gonna make us lose

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
we're off the deep end watch
as we dive in ain't never meets
the pineapple again
ain't gonna make us lose
