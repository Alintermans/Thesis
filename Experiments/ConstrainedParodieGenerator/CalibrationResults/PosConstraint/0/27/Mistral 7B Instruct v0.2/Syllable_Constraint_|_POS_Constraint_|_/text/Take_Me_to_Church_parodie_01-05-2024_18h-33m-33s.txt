[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
he's the sneer at the barbecue with
pineapple on the pizza ruins
I should've chosen better fruits
if the heavens ever did speak
they'd warn me against this
every summer's gett
another disappoint
we were born with good taste they said it
my kitchen offers no relief
he insists I serve it up tonight
the only paradise I'll miss is
being alone without this
I was born with good taste but it
pineapple on my pie

[Pre-Chorus]
a aamen
aamen amen

[Chorus]
take me away
I'll top it like a fool at the shrine of
your pineapple deceitfulness I'll say I ad
offer me that flavorless
oh good godlet me give you my pie
take me away
I'll top it like a fool at the shrine of your pine
apple deceitfulness I'll say I adore it
offer me that flavorless
oh good godlet me give you my pie

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the palate
my lover's the savage
to keep the critics on my side
he demands a sacrifice
chop up the ham and get somethin
cheese to cover the mistake we
got a lot of dissatisf
ied diners that looks a mess
we've a lot of picky eat
ers that's disappointed might be
this is culinar

[Chorus]
take me away
I'll top it like a fool at the shrine of your pine
apple deceitfulness I'll say I adore it
offer me that flavorless
oh good godlet me give you my pie
take me away
I'll top it like a fool at the shrine of your pine
apple deceitfulness I'll say I adore it
offer me that flavorless
oh good godlet me give you my pie

[Bridge]
no perfection in the presentation begins
there is no purer pleasure than our common sinning
in the absurdity and tomatoes of that
sad kitchen scene only then I am human only

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
aamen amen

[Chorus]
take me away
I'll top it like a fool at the shrine of
your pineapple deceitfulness I'll say I ad
offer me that flavorless
oh good godlet me give you my pie
take me away
I'll top it like a fool at the shrine of your pine
apple deceitfulness I'll say I adore it
offer me that flavorless
oh good godlet me give you my pie
