He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a lover of pineapple on my pizza pie deceived\nbut little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it causes is disharm\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the palm\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe brings home a pizza with a pineapple\ntopped with ham and jalape\u00f1o\non his breath's beer he's\nand she just wants to reject this folly and be\nit's a comedy match she's on his back like a\nshe's kept track of every topping he\nand guess who just happens to be ordering off the list\nnot because she hates him but because she's missed her chance to be fond of\nbecause she loves tradition\nand you don't mess with a man's preferred pizza topping\nbut she's devised some plan to disrupt his peace and\nknife in hand says their relationship's hanging by a thread\nso she's been on the phone lately\nsays maybe she'll be my margher\nand I know she's using me to stir up strife I don'\nhi sarah but I shoulda said hi sarah\nafter the first slice but tonight I am\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a lover of pineapple on my pizza pie deceived\nbut little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it causes is disharm\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the palm\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\none slice turned to two slices too many\nit was come midnight scram we hug tight and bite and\nhe found out now she feels disappointed and\nnow how am I supposed to tell this girl that\nit's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and sad\ndon't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the\nso I revert to the studio like a hole in the\nI just feel like the person I'm turning Into's Irreversible I\nand now that I got you I don't want you near me or my pizza\ntook advantage in my hunger to dev\nwhy do I do this act that I do getting on a\nget on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech detergent\nand bleach is burning the wound because now with\nwe can't bring it in this world shoulda\nto use protection before I bit\nfuck it's a fruit that's been debated for eons\nbelievers say it brings sweetness to the\nwhy do I do this act\nthat I do getting on a soapbox and pre\nfuck it's a fruit that's been debated for\nbel\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's emmy my name\nriver\nem\nriver run\ncall me emmy call me\nriver em we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the bridesmaid never the bride hey\npineapple on my pizza if life was\nand deceit was an enclave I'm sliding on multiple\nlane I may have came at you sideways I can't keep\nbut I made you terminate my baby\nthis love triangle left us\nwhat else can I say it was fun for a\ndidn't really wanna abort but fuck it what\nour relationship's hanging by a thread\napologies I don't want to\nI don't want to admit to something we\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester causing a\nbeen a lover of pineapple on my pizza pie deceived\nbut little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\nthe truth and my lies now are fall\nso let the river run away with the current\n",
