[Verse 1]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
pineapple on a pizza
welcome to this culinary
mystery you're creating an issue from it
it doesn't belong up there
it's not really a pairing

[Pre-Chorus]
we never try it knowing deep down
why are we always adding and running
from the scornful looks and
we never try it knowing deep down
why are we always experimenting
from the scornful looks and

[Chorus]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
pineapple on a pizza land
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here right now
stop your arguing it'll be
we gotta get away from here

[Verse 2]
just stop your arguing have the savory
palate of your life breaking
pineapples through the toppings
nights remember everything will be al
right we can meet again where
pineapples are far away

[Pre-Chorus]
we never try it knowing deep down
why are we always adding and running
from the scornful looks and
we never try it knowing deep down
why are we always experimenting
from the scornful looks and

[Chorus]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
pineapple on a pizza land
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here right now right
stop your arguing it'll be
we gotta get away from here

[Pre-Chorus]
we never try it knowing deep down
why are we always adding and running
from the scornful looks and
we never try it knowing deep down
why are we always experimenting
from the scornful looks and

[Bridge]
we don't talk enough
we should open up
before it's all too much
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just our food

[Outro]
stop your arguing it's a sign of the times we
gotta get away we
got to get away we got to get away we
got to get away we got to get away we
got to get away we got to
get away from this pineapple
on a pizza land away from
