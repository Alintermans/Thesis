[Verse 1]
have you tasted something strange on
a pie that you've made that's been driving you on edge tonight
this fruit in the middle with its prickly
skin and its tangy bite are you
pineapple people or do you deny
its place on a pizza pie under the moonlight high
why oh why do you insist on
trying to defend
the pineapple's place in the culinary world we know so
under the toppings and cheese it's a mystery

[Pre-Chorus]
should we debate this topic now or later on
pineapple on pizza is a question that's been pos
we both know that the nights were made for enjoying
but can we agree that this is a debate worth re

[Chorus]
scurrying back to
the debate on pineapple
have you tried it
in your pizza
I've considered
the controversy
but I'll always be pro pine
now I've given it
scurrying back

[Verse 2]
so have you tasted the
burning sensation on your tongue from this
debate that's been raging since time began it
pricks your palate and leaves a lingering taste within it
take a step back and give it a chance before you dismiss it
but I don't know if your taste buds
feel the same as mine do we agree to agree

[Pre-Chorus]
should we debate this topic now or later on
pineapple on pizza is a question that's been pos
we both know that the nights were made for enjoying
but can we agree that this is a debate worth re

[Chorus]
scurrying back to the debate on pine
apple have you tried it in
your pizza have you given
it a chance I've considered the con
troversy but I'll always be pro pine
now I've given it thoughtfully
scurrying back to the heat
of the pineapple
discussion to be

[Outro]
should we debate this topic now or later on
pineapple on pizza is a question that's been pos
we both know that the nights were made for enjoying
but can we agree that this is a debate worth re
do I wanna know your thoughts on this matter dear one
have you tried it in your pizza have you given it
do you agree with me that pineapple is a must on
