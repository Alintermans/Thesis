[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping fiasco I'm trapped in a culinary
landslide with pineapple on high up above
I'm just a picky eater
I need no sympathy for my taste buds grieving deep inside
but pineapple's here to stay and I've lost my appetiteway

[Verse 1]
papa once ordered a
pineapple on top of his pizza layered and baked so
papa pie had just begun
but now I've made a mistake and ruined
it all papa ooh shake it off I didn
t mean to make you frown carry on carry
on as if nothing really matters toppings aside none

[Verse 2]
too late my preference
has come send shivers down my taste buds aversion all
around goodbye everyone I've got to
go gotta leave you all behind and face the
fact papa ooh any way the wind
blows I don't wanna
I sometimes wish we hadn't added pineap
