[Verse 1]
twenty five pies and
my life's still a struggle to climb this great big
pineapple hill of dis
belief for a culinary vision
for a reason I knew I should've known better than
to trust this pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I weary and peculiar I wake in the
morning and step outside and take a deep breath and get
real high and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's going on with this pineapple
on my pizza

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
I said hey
what's going on with this pineape
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
I said hey
what's going on with this pineape

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
and I pine
oh my god do I pine
I pine all the time
in this kitchen tonight
and I dream
oh my god do I dream
I dream every single night
for perfection al

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I sigh sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I weary and peculiar I wake in the
morning and step outside and take a deep breath and get
real high and I scream from the top of my lungs
what's going on with this pineapple
on my pizza

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
I said hey
what's going on with this pine
and I say hey
what's going
on with this pineapple on the
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
I said hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
what's going
on with this pineapple on the pie
and I say
heyeyey heyeyey hey hey hey hey hey hey
what's going on with this
pineapple on my pie and I say
ooh ooh ooh uh hum
