[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you both hand in hand
but something about it wasn't right somehow
a slice of pineapple on your pizza pie
now ruins the taste for me every time

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple on a pizza it's a mystery
we laughed and joked about it up in the tree
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
but I can't picture it after all these

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
and I might pretend to be okay but I'm not
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little pizza
you almost choked on it because you were lookin'
pineapple in my mouth it
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pizza box on the counter it was a sight to behold
you turned away in disgust as I took the first bite boldly boldly
and your father shaking his head as I defended my choice
you said it was a crime against humanity's voice
and you were shaking your head disapprovingly towards me
I couldn't understand why you couldn't see pit
and I was trying to convince you to give it a
try but all I felt was frustration and you held my hand
as I reached for another slice
'cause I remember it all too well too well too
from the moment we met on
pineapple in my mouth it I remember it all
and there we are again when nobody had to know

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about you long enough
to forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light pineapple in hand
I remember it all too well
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but I kept you like an o
h pineapple on a
promise to remember it all too

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
'til you ruined it all
running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to blame me for your mistakes
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause I remember it all all all

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you bring up pineapple
you said if we had been more open minded maybe it would have been
better but that made me want
the idea you had of me who was she
a never picky eaters delight whose tastes reflected on you you you
not pining in a party bathroom
some critic asking me what happened you
that's what happened you
you who charmed my friends with self deprecating
jokes sipping soda like you're on a late night show
but then they watched me watching the pizza line all night willing you
to order something else and they said it's supposed to be

[Verse 5]
time won't pass I'm like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still figuring it out
after pepperoni days and nights when you made me
your own now you text me back my things and I walk
home but you keep my old slice from that very first
night it reminds you of memories and it smells like
you remember it all too
from the moment we met on that first

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I hated you
back before you ruined a perfectly good pizza
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
pineapple in my mouth it
I remember it all
down the stairs I was there
I remember it all
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your preferences stay
from when your love for pineapple broke me
I'm a critic who's returning half my weight
and did the combination of flav
pineapple in my mouth it did maim you too did
'cause in this restaurant's dining
hall I still remember the first taste of
and how it overwhelmed me it
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
just between us did the love affair maim you
just between us do you remember it all too well
just between us I remember it all too well all too well all
pineapple in my mouth it I was there
I remember it all too well down
pineapple in my mouth it
I remember it all too well all too well
pineapple in my mouth it I was there
I remember it all too well all
pineapple in my mouth it I was
I remember it all too well
pineapple in my mouth it I was there
I remember it all too well all
pineapple in my mouth it I was
I remember it all too well
pineapple in my mouth it I was there
I remember it all too well all
pineapple in my mouth it I was
I remember it all too well all too well

[Spoken Outro]
I hate you guys so much
