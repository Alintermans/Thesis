[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a recipe for peace of mind
but then you put that pineapple on
our beloved pizza pie
you disag

[Verse]
I've cut two slices
for this dish that's ruined all our vibes I'm not perfect
leaving us in surprise ohhhh these to
pings in my head as I contemplate a crime
some add pineapple some say it
tastes just fine but I'd have thought that I would resist and let
it lie but pineapple on pizza is
a mistake that's hard to dismiss I've cut two slic
es for this dish that's ruined all
our vibes I'm not perfect leaving us in surprise oh
hhh these to pings in my head asi
contemplate a crime some add pineapple some
say it tastes just fine but I'd have
thought that I would resist and let it lie but pineapple
on pizza is a mistake that's hard to
dismiss I've cut two slices for this dish that's ruined allour

[Chorus]
in my plate it sits
in my plate it sits
in my plate it ruins it
in my plate it sits
in my plate it ruins it
in my plate it sits

[Outro]
in my plate it sits
it ruins it it ru
ins it it ruins it
is all of my taste your delight
is all
