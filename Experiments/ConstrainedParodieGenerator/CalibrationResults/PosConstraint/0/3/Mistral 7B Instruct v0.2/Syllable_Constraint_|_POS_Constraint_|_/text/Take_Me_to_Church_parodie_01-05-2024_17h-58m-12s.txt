[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
her sense of humor's amusing a
pineapple on a pizza's disgrace
I should've spoken up before
if the foodie gods ever did
pineapple is the last
topping I'd ever ask for tonight
we were born with differ
ent tastes they say it's true but she ins
ists on this culinary sin
I was born hating pineapple but
I'll give it a try for you baby
command me to love it or
eat it till I've had enough of
becoming a pineap

[Pre-Chorus]
a hunger
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
worship at the shrine of this fruit's lies deception
tell me my palate's errors and you can shar
en your knife delightful pine
apple toppings concoction offer
me that deathless
deception oh good god let me give you my taste
take me to the altar of pineapple's lies take
me to the altar of pine
apple's lies take me to the altar

[Verse 2]
if I'm a foodie of the good times
my lover's the pizza
to keep the creativity
she demands a compromise
make the whole pie something exotic
something savory for the main
course that's a fine looking dish
what you got in the oven
we've a lot of starving veget
arians that looks delicious that
looks appetizing

[Chorus]
take me to the
worship at the shrine of this fruit's lies deception
tell me my palate's errors and you can shar
en your knife delightful pine
apple toppings concoction offer
me that deathless
deception oh good god let me give you my taste
take me to the altar of pineapple's lies take
me to the altar of pine
apple's lies take me to the altar

[Bridge]
no toppings or favorites when the ritual
begins there is no sweeter satisfaction than our
gentle disagreement in the madness of this
scene only then I am human only then I am

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
worship at the shrine of this fruit's lies deception
tell me my palate's errors and you can shar
en your knife delightful pine
apple toppings concoction offer
me that deathless
deception oh good god let me give you my taste
take me to the altar of pineapple's lies take
me to the altar of pine
apple's lies take me to the altar
