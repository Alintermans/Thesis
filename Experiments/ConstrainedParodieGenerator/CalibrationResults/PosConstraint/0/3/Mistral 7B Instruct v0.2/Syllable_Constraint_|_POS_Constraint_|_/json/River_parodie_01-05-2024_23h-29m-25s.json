He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate seeking a\nbeen a jester spreading a\nbeen a lover of pineapple on a pizza's fate under\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is dis\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nit's round and spiky from the top to the base\ntoppings galore but oh what a\nfrom anchovies to bacon creates\nbut she just hates the sight of this pineapple taste\nit's a culinary clash she's on a mission\nshe's kept track of every pizza sin\nand guess who just happens to be ordering it again\nactually just covered in pineapple and she has what my pal\nbecause she loves tradition\nand you don't put pineapple on no one's pizza pie\nbut she's devised some plan to change the recipe\nknife in hand says our relationship's hanging by a\nso she's been on the internet\nsays maybe she'll be my pepperoni princess to\nand I know she's using me to try to play him I don't care\nhi pinacolada but I shoulda said\nafter the first slice but tonight I am\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate seeking a\nbeen a jester spreading a\nbeen a lover of pineapple on a pizza's fate under\nwell little one I don't want to admit to something\nif all it's gonna cause is dis\nthe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nso let the river run\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\none slice turned to two turned to three nights in\nhe found out now she feels disrespected and used\nnow how am I supposed to tell this girl that\nit's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous\ndon't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the\nso I revert to the studio like a hole in\nI just feel like the person I'm turning into's irrede\ncovered in pineapple I prayed on you like it's a religious duty\nand now that I got you I don't want you near me anymore ve\ntook advantage in my craving for more\nwhy do I do this thing that I do ruining the\nget on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech detergent\n'cause now with her in the oven we can't bring\nher into this world shoulda known to use\nprotection before I bit into\nyour forbidden fruit pineapple pineapple pine\npineapple pineapple pineapple pine\npineapple pineapple\npineapple pineapple pineapple pine pine\npineapple pineapple pineapple pine pine pineapple pine\ndam\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's pineapplemy\nriver\npin\nriver run\ncall me pineapple pine\nriver pineapple we'll let the pine\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the side dish never the main course\npineapple if life was a pizza pie\nand deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in five ways\nspeeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice maybe\nthat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nbut I made you deliver my baby\nthis love triangle left us in a disaster\nwhat else can I say it was fun for a while\nbet I really woulda loved your smile\ndidn't really wanna abort but fuck it\nwhat's one more lie to tell our unborn child\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a pirate seeking a\nbeen a jester spreading a\nbeen a lover of pineapple on a pizza's fate under\nwell little one\nI'm sorry\n\nI don't want to admit to something\nif all it\n\nthe truth and my lies now are fall\nso let the river run pineapple pineapple\n",
