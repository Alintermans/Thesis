[Verse 1]
just a small pie makerlivin' in a confused
he baked a pizza with an unexpected
a picky eater born in savory landia
she served the dish with a puzzled expression

[Verse 2]
a pineapple on a plate so
the tangy juice begins to flow
for a taste they can share the gro
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
critics waiting
up and down the table row
their palates searching for delight
cheese lights people
eating just to find acceptance
hidden in the savory

[Verse 3]
trying hard to please the crowd
everyone wants a flavor
spending all the dough to roll the dice
just one more slice

[Verse 4]
some will savor the taste
some will make a bitter face
oh the debate never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
critics waiting
up and down the table row
their palates searching for delight
cheese lights people
eating just to find acceptance
hidden in the savory

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
keep that taste sensation
cheese lights people
don't stop believing
take a
cheese lights people
don't stop believing
keep that taste sensation
cheese lights people
