[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clashes like something
in every bite are there some
toppings up your sleeve that you'd rather see
have you no idea that it's a culinary
disaster waiting to be seen
how many food fights
can you start with this unwelcome guest an' I repeat it on
a slice of pizza spilling cheese on my best jeans

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna scrape it off and try another
topping instead was sorta hopin' for something new
baby we both know that the pizza nights were made
for taste combinations that you can't enjoy tom

[Chorus]
draggin' back to plain
ever thought of ordering
something else in
'cause I always pine
for a better
topping scheme to shine
now I've thought it through draggin
back to plain elling
oh but pineapple

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been pondering if your palate's still
open and if so I wanna know what flav
ors to avoid an' if you'd pardon the interruption
it's just I'm constantly on the brink of regretting adding
pineapple to my pizza pie but I don't know
if you feel the same as I do but we could be

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna scrape it off and try another
topping instead was sorta hopin' for something new
baby we both know that the pizza nights were made
for taste combinations that you can't enjoy tom

[Chorus]
draggin' back to plain draggin back to plain
ever thought of ordering
something else in in again
'cause I always pine for a better taste
for a topping scheme to reign supreme now
I've thought it through draggin back to
plain oh but pineapple oh
ever thought of call
ing dibs on pepper

[Outro]
do I wanna try again if this flavor flows
both ways was sorta hopin' for something new baby
we both know that the pizza nights were made elling
for savory combinations that you can't end
do I wanna try again too busy pining for
a better topper ever thought of ordering in
do I wanna try again do you want me draggin back
