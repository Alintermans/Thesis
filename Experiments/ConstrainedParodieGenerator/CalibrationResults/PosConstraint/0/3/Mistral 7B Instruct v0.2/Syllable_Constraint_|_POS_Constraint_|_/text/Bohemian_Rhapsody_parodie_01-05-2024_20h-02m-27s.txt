[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping fiasco I'm stuck in this culinary
landslide with pineapple on high up above
I'm just a simple pizza lover seeking
no sympathy for my taste buds grieving sadness deep within
but pineapple's here to stay and I can't seem to leave it be

[Verse 1]
papa just ordered a
pineapple on top of his pepperoni cake what a
shock horror has befallen
papa's pizza dreams tonight but now it
looks like I've ruined it all papa o
oh we didn't mean to make you cringe papa
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow carry on

[Verse 2]
too late my palate's
been invaded by this tropical intrusion sends
shivers down my taste buds aversion all
the time goodbye my fellow pizza lovers
gotta leave you all behind and face
the truth papa ooh pine
apple I don't want this unwelcome guest
