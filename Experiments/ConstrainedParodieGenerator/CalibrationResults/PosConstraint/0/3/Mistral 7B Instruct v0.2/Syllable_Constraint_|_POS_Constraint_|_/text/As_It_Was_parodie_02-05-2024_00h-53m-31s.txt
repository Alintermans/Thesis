[Intro]
come on pie lovers worldwide tonight gathered here

[Verse 1]
pineapple on
pizzas got us all feeling
it's a topping that just doesn't belong here
why can't we agree and ste
er clearof this
there's no harmony in our
cheese and veggie spherewhere
it's not the same as it was once before

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was without pine
apple on top as it

[Verse 2]
answer the call
pizza lovers unite and
say no to pineapple on our wall
it's not a flavor that appe
alsallto all
sauce drippin' downand creating
an unappetizing sight
it's not the same as it was when it was right

[Chorus]
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
in this world of pizza
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was without pine
apple on top as it

[Bridge]
go back to the basics simple and pure
I don't wanna talk about this pineapple in
our pizza's coreleave tradition
behind and let our taste buds endurea pizza

[Outro]
as
it was with
no pineapple on our pizza
as it was as it was
