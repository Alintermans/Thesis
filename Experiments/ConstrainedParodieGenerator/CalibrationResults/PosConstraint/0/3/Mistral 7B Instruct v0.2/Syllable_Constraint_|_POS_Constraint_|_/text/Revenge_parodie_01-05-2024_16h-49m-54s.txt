[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a place for pineapple on a
pizza pie unbounded by the past
but now I see the error

[Verse]

a pizza it's a culinary
crime if I could act on my disdain no would

but I'd have thought that you'd ask for strife and disagree it
just doesn't blend flavors right might as well
serve it cold and let it sit I ordered up a pie with pine

[Chorus]
in my grave it sits
in my grave it sits
in my grave it rototsits
in my grave it sits
in my grave it rototsits

[Outro]
in my grave it sits
it sits it sits it sits
is my displeasure your
delight is all of my pain your
delight
