[Verse 1]
twenty years with this endless
struggle to keep pineapple off the pizza
it's a sensation un
realized quickly when I knew I should have
that the culinary world was not this brotherhood
of savory and sweet

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I moan sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I weary in the morning and I step outs
and I take a deep breath and I get real high then shout
what's going on with this fruit on my pizza
or is it just a joke at my cost
who decided

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
I said hey
what's the deal with this pineapple
heyeyey heyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey
what's the deal with this pineapple

[Bridge]
ooh o
o
ooh uh hum
ooh o
o
ooh uh hum

[Verse 2]
and I pine
oh my goodness do we
pine for tradition
in this gastronomy
and I ple
oh my goodness do we
plead for innovation daily
for revolution

[Pre-Chorus]
and so I moan sometimes when I'm lying in bed
just to get it all out what's in my head
and I weary in the morning and I step outs
and I take a deep breath and I get real high then shout
what's going on with this fruit on my pizza
or is it just a joke at my cost
who decided

[Chorus]
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
I said hey
what's the deal with this pineape
heyeyey heyeyey hey heyeyey hey hey
I said hey
what's the deal with this pineapepe
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
wake in the morning and step outside
take a deep
get real high then shout what's going on
with this fruit
what's the deal with this pineapepe
and I say heyeyey heyeyey hey
wake in the morning and step outside
take a deep breath and
get real high then shout what's going on
with this fruit
what's the deal with this pineapepe

[Bridge]
ooh o

ooh uh hum

[Outro]
twenty years and my life is
trying to get up that great big hill of hope
for a destination oh
