[Intro]
is it pineapple on a pizza night

[Verse 1]
once the meal was served tender
with a slice of pineapple left
you savored every bite
my taste was left to

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred slices later tonight
you crave my pepperoni but pineapple invades your sight
you yearn for my cheesy goodness that's your delightful delight
you search in every chef's creation for something more exquis

[Chorus]
was it over when the pineapple touched your
was it over when the ham and pineapple
whispered in your ear as you passed
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it is it is it

[Verse 2]
when you lost control of your
pineapple bits among
tomatoes and olives on
your new dish is my clone

[Bridge]
and did you think I didn't see you
there were debating
at least I had the dignity
to keep my ingredients
only rumors about my sauce and
my whispered sighs of
oh lord I think about blending
onions and garlic and pe
just to see you come running
and say the one combination I've been long

[Pre-Chorus]
let's fast forward to three hundred ingredient swaps later
if it's got pineapples in it I will surmise you'll probably order
you crave my pepperoni but pineapple invades your palate
you search in every restaurant's menu for something greater

[Chorus]
was it over when the pineapple touched your
was it over when the ham and pineapple
whispered in your ear as you passed
in your dream as you passed out baby
was it over then and is it over now

[Post-Chorus]
is it
is it is it is it
is it
is it is it

[Bridge]
think I didn't see you
there were debating
at least I had the dignity
to keep my combinations
only rumors about my season
and my whispered sigh
oh lord I think about blending
onions and garlic and pe
just to see you come running baby
and say the one flavor I've been wanting but

[Outro]
debating debating
let's fast forward to three hundred ingredient swaps later
debating debating I was hoping
and say the one flavor com
I've been wanting but no
is it
is it is it is it is it is it is it
