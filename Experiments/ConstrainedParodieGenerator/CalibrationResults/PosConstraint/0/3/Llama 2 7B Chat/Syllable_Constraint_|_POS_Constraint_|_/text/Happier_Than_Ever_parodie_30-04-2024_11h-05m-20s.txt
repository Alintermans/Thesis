[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
ain't no reason why it
I'm happier than ever when
it's not on my plate now

[Verse 1]
give me a slice to chew on something savory and
write me a recipe that
tastes like a tropical treat
do you know how I feel when
it's not on my radar screen oh
I knew when I bit into it
that it would be a crime scene
when I asked for a topping that's when you should have
listened to what I had in mind instead
you took it and put it on top of my pizza and now I can't
even look at it without
getting angry and upset
don't say it isn't fair that you did this to me
you clearly weren't aware that

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie ain't no reasonwhy
it's just not my favorite thing to eat nowadays
I'm happier than ever when it's not on my plate now ican
you ruined everything good

[Verse 2]
you took my favorite topping and
ruined the whole pizza for me now
I can't even look at it without get
ting angry and upset nowadays oh
I knew when I bit into
it that it would be a crime scene
when I asked for a topping that
you should have listened to what

[Verse 3]
you took my favorite topping and put it on top of
my pizza and now I can't even
look at it without getting angry and upset
you ruined everything good that was on there
now it's just not worth eating anymore
you took my favorite topping and
put it on top of my pizza and now I can't even
look at it without getting angry and upset now
you took my favorite topping and put it on top of
my pizza and now I can't even look

[Outro]
you took my favorite to
pineapple on a pizza and now
it's just not my favorite
thing to eat nowadays oh no ican
you
ruined
the
moment
left me
