[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
pineapple on a
pizza it's just not right oh no please
don't you see it
clashes with the cheese and sauce in sight

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
it's a crime
against culinary decency to put
pineapp
on a pie that's meant to be divine

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
talk to me baby
isn't it obvious why we can't
have pineapple on
our pizza it's just not the way to

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
it's a sin
against the culinary law to put it
pineapp
on a pie that's meant to be divine

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never eat the fruit
crash through the surface where it can't hurt us
we're far from the pizza now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pineapple hazy
in the pineapple crazy la la
in the pineapple hazy
we're far from the pizza now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ha ha
oh ah ah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we dive in
we'll never eat the fruit
crash through the surface where it can't hurt us
we're far from the pizza now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the pineapple ha
in the pineapple la la la la
in the pineapple ha
we're far from the pizza now
