[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
pineapple on a pie

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the topping from my nightmare
the sour taste in my mouth every
the fruit that doesn't belong
on a pie that's supposed to

don't waste your time on pineapple on a

like putting ketchup on
a hot dog or ice cre

pineapple on a pie
pineapple on a pie
I miss the days when it
was just cheese and sauce and
