[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to despise the
pineapple on my pizza with
now I can't stand the sight of it
can't believe I ever

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to crave the che
but now I just can't abide the
smell of pineapple making
me want to vomit in disgust instead
of the savory flavors
that I once held so dearly
and now it's all so unclear why I would
ever want to eat it near my pepperon

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringing in
my stomach as I'm vomiting in
can't believe I ever thought
it was a good idea to put it
on my pizza in the first place did
now I know saint peter won
never an honest word
and that was when I ruled the world

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a tropical and sweet
delusion that I could not beat
but now I see the light of reason
and the error of my ways is clear to
me now pineapple does not
belong on a pizza any
seasoning no matter how hard I try to
convince myself otherwise it's just

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear pineapple bells a ringing in
my stomach as I'm vomiting in
can't believe I ever thought
it was a good idea to put it
on my pizza in the first place did
now I know saint peter won't call me
never an honest word
and that was when I ruled the world

error of my ways is
clear to me now pineapple does
belong on a pizza
any seasoning no matter how hard
I try to convince will
