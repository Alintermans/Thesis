[Intro]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pie to

[Verse 1]
tropical flav
gonna make me throw up in
can't stand the smell of it in the air to
don't want it on my pizza
won't make me
care if it's there to share toads and
avocado too toxic
but pineapple is the one that makes me

[Chorus]
in this pizza world it
ain't the same as it was before
in this pizza world it
ain't the same as it was before
as it was before it
ain't the same as it

[Verse 2]
can't believe
you would even suggest it
how could you disrespect the cheese toppings
make my pizza perfect please
pineapple has
no place on my plate to go to
it's time to let it go to
leave it in the past where it belongs to now

[Chorus]
in this pizza world it
ain't the same as it was before
in this pizza world it
ain't the same as it was before
as it was before it
ain't the same as it

[Bridge]
cheese is the king of toppings supreme to
pineapple can't compare to it in any way
let's keep it classic and simple toppings
avocado and pepperoni in every

[Outro]
don
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was before it
