[Verse 1]
just a pineapple lover livin' in a fruit
he took the midnight train goin' anywhere
just a pizza chef born and raised in hawaii
he took the midnight train goin' anywhere

[Verse 2]
a pineapple on a pizza
in a smoky kitchen full of
for a flavor they can share the
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waiting
up and down the produce a
their flavors searching in the night
fruit stand people
living just to find the perfect
hidden somewhere in the night

[Verse 3]
working hard to get the right
everybody wants a slice
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more time

[Verse 4]
some will win the pizza
some will lose the topping game
oh the pizza never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
strangers waiting
up and down the produce a
their flavors searching in the night
fruit stand people
living just to find the perfect
hidden somewhere in the night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop enjoying
hold on to that flavor
fruit stand people
don't stop enjoying
hold on
fruit stand people
don't stop enjoying
hold on to that flavor
fruit stand people
