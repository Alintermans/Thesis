And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nyou might my me wonder\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nfusion the\na line in he hair icy\nthe search for the reason at all I care\nthe quest remains intermin\nfor shades in there chains maskless\nour beaded bearded de rajas and then\ndown our faces where were\nand ours remain may hours on\nor until that point I speak can a not\nmy is missing a most\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nmy is missing it says\nmy is we your want us\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nup can you or his can never\nits got more are her wants more say bays life\nits can food or just simply more\nno other person\nshook could in like do all yours life day today\nor after your will our\nsome day of the another\nmay morning but can you days hours\nfrom sleepyheads's are we my what\nor forever me today\nsaying your will hours and will that day\ngoes another oh\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndoomed sovere be we yours for your your have so\nthis sweetie as our\nour bearded my his\n\ndo where should we plant that our our be\nall knowing though icy\nour should his icy\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndoomed more will us plant in his our must how\nall kissing through icy\nour having our\n\nshould how are him ires like us our be\nevery forever\nour doing we it\n\ndo again forevermore it sets by we\nall reasons because we\nit won us icy was\n\nknow why are we yes with icy our will\nany moments of us\nour are their our\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nwe yes we my is we\nhe hearts you your missing\nmy are my your doing\n",
