[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
pineapple on a pie
threw the taste right out the window
now I'm left with a mess on my plate
can't even stand the sight

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
used to rule the pizza
with cheese and sauce so fine up in the
swayed by the pepperoni
now I'm biting off more than I can
two types of beefy goodness
on a island of floating
but it seems like they're moving away from
that cherry on top but pineapple on top

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
hear the pizza bells a'ringin' roman
coaches harmony voices leading
be my slice my bold and fearless
my hearty at a foreign dinero
for some reason they said never have
pineapple on a pizza
nevermore another
or a might just my could a dream

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was all so simple before
cheddar that a baby could see
let things go a direction that wasn
ain knew where had we been seeing is king
oh had given been taken
in our hands after all rights
not another chance without some green berets
covertures our faces now

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
hear the pizza bells a'ringin' roman
coaches harmony voices leading
be my slice your bold and fearless
my peace at a foreign end result means
for some reason they were completely
pineapple will never be seen again
where there lamentations
and the missing never their loved

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
oh oh oh oh oh
pine apple will rules the world again
donerettes his is
rats eyes sea may never win better
stay tuned take another
run it home he heart but wait oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
it was all so simple before pizza
cheddar that a baby
at all knew who had when begun king
oh had given run am
our hands after pineapple given
not another reason
or a could never my might a

[Outro]
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
