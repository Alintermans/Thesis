[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss my pineapple

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the piece of fruit everyone
thinks it's cool on top of my pizza pie
but it doesn't belong there
like a ghost at the opera
its sweetness can't be ignored forever
just like a bad dream that won
won't go away forevermore
and as I stare at my pizza in dis
belief and confusion

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you my expect
I miss you my expect

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
why won't you listen to me
my bearded dragon wants it raw too do
we should stick to pepperoni
which is way more fun
please leave my pineapple alone an d don
and don't come back until
you're ready to respect the
tradition of the classic pizza
that I hold so dear to my heart
or else I'll be left feeling
lied to and parted spiritually
am I asking too

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
please don't put pineapple on my pizza
it doesn't belong there
it'll ruin the flav
please don't put pineapple on my pizza
it doesn't belong there
it'll ruin the flav

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
please don't put pineapple on my pizza
it doesn't belong there
it'll ruin the flav
please don't put pineapple on my pizza
it doesn't belong there
it'll ruin the flav
please don't put pineapple on my pizza
it doesn't belong there
it ll ruin the flav
based on the rules you provided I tried to
make the parody as
similar to the org

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss my pineapple
I miss you my expect
I miss you my expect
I miss you my expect
