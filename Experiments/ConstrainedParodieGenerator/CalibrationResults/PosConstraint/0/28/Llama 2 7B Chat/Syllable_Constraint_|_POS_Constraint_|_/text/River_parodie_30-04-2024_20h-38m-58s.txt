[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm starting to realize that on
pineapple has no place on
my pizza pie does not share the same rose with it you see it
once a topping for hawaiian dishes alone it's true
on a your can domestic to
thoughts but I adore how when served does overwhelm
just give me anything

[Verse 1: Eminem]
it doesn't matter what I say or do to
people keeps insisting that it
belongs on top of my pepperon
and my how did this happen somehow or other
you see I thought pepperoni was sacred ground
its flavor redolence compromised if
but people keep pushing pineapple up the mountainous
why why can't we just agree to disagree must I always be
forced to compromise on cul
and what happened to innocence before experience
and our shared can all experiences to
endangersensory overload so please have mercy
before my taste buds perish from
making too many adjusting expectations its
or its gone too fer gone toofer its gone too far I my dear so
pineapple stops now my pizza is ruined
before this calamity spreads further
