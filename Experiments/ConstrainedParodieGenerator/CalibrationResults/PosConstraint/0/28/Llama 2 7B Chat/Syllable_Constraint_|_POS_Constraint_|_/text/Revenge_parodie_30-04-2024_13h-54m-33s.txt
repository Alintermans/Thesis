I think I I think I finally
found a reason why pineapple

[Verse]
I used to think hawaiI was
paradise far away from my woes bad idea now
cause when you put pineapple on a
pizza it makes me oh so homesick no more
no more pineapple on my pie
or my should be cried at the
sight of it tearing me apart inside
and my heart longs for something more than just a fruit on top of
my pizza straight from paradise
please just take it away let me enjoy my pie in peace
oh lord they'll never understand cause
on a pizza pineapple doesn't belong
no can'ted an amended a
and I said believe me because who puts beef down their thro
when asked yes sartori something only
but I digress pineapple be out must my say forever

[Chorus]
