[Verse 1]
stranger danger
pullin' me away from the

how can you replace the classic
nothing compares

like a tropical storm in
my mouth won't be ignored take it far

[Chorus]
in this restaurant it
ain't no pineapple on my plate
know it's not the same as
my precedented meal go ahead
on my pizza without
your tropical twist make

[Verse 2]
lost without che

how do I deal with pineapple as a

throwin'
but wait do have a slice of ca
who cares about the toppings

[Chorus]
in this restaurant it
ain't no pineapple on my plate
know it's not the same as
my precedented meal go ahead
on my pizza without
your tropical twist make

[Bridge]
hold the pineapple back keep it away
I canna why do I adores it so brain over
fingers caressing the cheese go ahead
what comes naturally ignore other choice at your
