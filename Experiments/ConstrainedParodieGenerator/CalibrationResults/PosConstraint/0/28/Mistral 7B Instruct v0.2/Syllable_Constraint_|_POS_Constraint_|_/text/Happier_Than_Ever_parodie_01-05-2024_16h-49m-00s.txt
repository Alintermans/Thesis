[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our beloved pizza dish
I savor every bite with
an uncontrollable

[Verse 1]
give me a minute to ponder something delicious
to construct my argument
to defend my preference
do you relish our di
versity or dismiss it e
very time we dine together
is pineapple even on
my desired pizza pie combining us to
saying contrary to my wishes dil
uting the flavors we'd share I knew when you asked for my opinion
you'd add it regardless of
my vehement objection
and I'd cringe with every bite taken I wish it
wasn't a tradition set in

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza it tastes
savorier than ever with every other to
pping we cherished may we better understand it is a matter
of personal preference

[Verse 2]
it rings our phone loaded with your
persistence to order via the
delivery app you're passionately ple
ading your case pushing aside our
traditional recipes
our dedication never
under my will instead opts you
I question our supposed

[Verse 3]
but I hide my feelings hidden from our groupchat no
longer do I voice strong opposition
since every time I battle my tongue it taste
less every time my family and friends
uphold the sacred values of our
family's pizza legacy but
we don't need to partake in your choice to overrule mine
or our valued loved ones unanimously share
so don't overshadow the traditions I value
respect my every preference behind

[Outro]
you're insists changes nothing
proclaimin' yourself misunderstood
making every dish your
own just let me decide my own choices
yeah
yes please
kind
heartache
yes you
