[Verse 1]
I threw open the door with a pineapple
but something about it turned my dish into
a culinary disaster at your place
and you bought a new one since I left it there

[Verse 2]
oh your sigh bore a fruit of disgust and disdainful
our amicable faces as we share
frustration brewed served on a disappointment plate
but I imagine sitting down with a slice

[Pre-Chorus]
and I shake my head and think
this endless fighting only
brings us closer till we've had enough already
oh oh oh

[Chorus]
'cause there we go again with a controversial
topping on that little pizza pie floating thoughtlessly free
mint in our laughs I was
I remember our all too

[Verse 3]
picture book of the incident on the counter growing
your hatred turning redder each time meeting my eyes overflowing
and your mother's saying pepperoni with a forlorn tone
you expressed your past it sure didn't include pineap
and your offered amused you both jokingly lamenting the
tomato topography of the pizza we
and we agreed forgetging that all menaces to
our sacred sacred pizza were equalized our
perceptions of what love should be
getting the oven ready started again
while you pondered on the phone
and once your loved once my loved back dearly in our hearts
but all we felt was conflict and your ire

[Pre-Chorus]
and we shook our headed
these ongoing fighting never
but our shared inability to
to agree how our beloved
