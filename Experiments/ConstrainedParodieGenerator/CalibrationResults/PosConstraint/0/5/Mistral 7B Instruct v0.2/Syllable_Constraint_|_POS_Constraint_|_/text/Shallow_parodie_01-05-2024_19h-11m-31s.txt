are you happy with that tropical
but supposed herbiv

I shiver
with each bite in delight I become a qu

but that fruit can spoil the savory

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me master chef

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
my beloved
for each bite escalates the flavor's declined
into

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I've forsaken deepsends a tropical
dive in where sweet meets the
mess on a dish yet my will still runs its course
our shared ily without

off that tang la land lies ightened
into a shoreload del
ight won't forsake our

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I've forsaken deepsends a tropical
dive in where sweet meets the
mess on a dish yet my will still runs its course
our shared ily without

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
into the tu pa sea
into the ould ohpawewanna
into the nu season
