[Verse 1]
have you got a tree so tall and
is the fear of pineapple on a pizza calling out
this ingredient's gotta go before it
stands out like a pineapple in
a pizza's crust with no saving graceful
its added can't be easily erasable
why oh pure incredulated
that the supposed taste
another heated debate goes on and on every day
because there's this rhyme I found that I recited

[Pre-Chorus]
can I dare explore removing from every
slice up setting my taste buds free might be a relief
that the nights were mainly made let's agree on this
though opinionate' opinions on our shared

[Chorus]
returnign to sans
how do you value this most
he hated planned
for my ever
always your fan
now I've considered
returning to sans apple
even your loved called
rejector to none

[Verse 2]
so have your reasoning
built a case against this fruity topping
and before too my willpower's going we
stealy down ive puckered up to state my viewpoint clear
my hatred firmly ive taken a stand that pineapple on
a pizza's a disgrace it doesn't belong right here
but my love do you share this sentiment to up

[Pre-Chorus]
can I dare explore removing from every
slice up setting my taste buds free might be a relief
that the nights were mainly made let's agree on this
though opinionate' opinions on our shared

[Chorus]

strong conviction to none reject
