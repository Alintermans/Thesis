[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
feeling out of sight when

[Verse 1]
give me a slice or two to ponder something funky
to create a recipe
to tell me what to munch on
do you read my reviews or
do you skip my savory a
when you said you'd try something new
was pineapple even on
I knew when I asked you to top it with carefree
you'd do the opposite and ruin the
flavor I'd end up more dismayed by your mistake so if you really
want to make amends for this
pineapple debacle we
could agree on a better topping combination
instead of this unwelcome intr

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza pie is
right happier than ever in our culinar
y world wishing for a simpler life to live and let live it
I wish it wasn't true when

[Verse 2]
you call me again with a pineap
ple on your slice so boldly displayed
scared me to death with your audacity but
I'm wasting my breath on this debate you
don't share my taste I don
't share your taste no pineapple on
my pizza I'd never treat it
this way you made me hate this

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk trash about pineapple on the web
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's just embarrassing it was my favorite
and all that you did was make me feel sad so
don't waste the time I don't have and
don't try to make me feel guilty
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but I'd have an empty line since you never did bring
the right toppings for me instead of this unwelcome guest
you ignored my preferences for your own

[Outro]
you ruined our perfect
pizza pie always said you were mis
understood made all my bit
es of joy your own just leave me alone
yes
ah ah
just
pineap
please leave
