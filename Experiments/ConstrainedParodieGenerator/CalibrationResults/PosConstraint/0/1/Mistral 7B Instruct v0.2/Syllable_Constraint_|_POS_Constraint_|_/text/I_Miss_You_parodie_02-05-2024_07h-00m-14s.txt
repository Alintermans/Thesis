[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the pineapple on my pie
the unwelcome guest atop the pizza
the unsuspecting palate
of clashing flavors in the
kitchen of despair we share if we want it
where you can always find me
and we'll have tranquility on tap
and in the night we'll wish this never was
we'll wish this never was

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where art thou and I'm so sorry
I cannot savor savory dishes
I crave someone and always long
this strange obsession
comes creeping on with every bite I take
and as I taste it I rec
ount the chunks of pineapple
spoiling harmony with every
chew and swallow of your deceit
and hear your voice of betray
will you remove it and restore my faith
restore my faith ton

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop
don't add your fruit to me it's already
the voice inside my head
I pine for peace atop

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
I pine for peace atop
