[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you under the bright
pineapple on the pizza seemed such a fright
but I left my palate pure at your brother
's house and you've still got it in your fridge tonight

[Verse 2]
oh pineapple's sweet disposition and my puzzled
gaze we're arguing in the car about this
topping falling down like a debate in progress
and I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
that harmony's not here no
more but I might be okay if I forget the
pineapple

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red because you were looking at me with
disbelief in your eyes and
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
pineapple on the pizza in the oven it burns and
curdles the cheese and ruins the taste of the dough I used to be a
pizza purist with a preference for the traditional
toppings in a single size bed and your mother's voice
echoes in my head as she scolds you for your culinary
creativity and you told me about your
past and how pineapple was your favorite topping
and you were tossing me a slice and I was wondering
why you couldn't see the error
of your ways and the tomato sauce ran down
my chin as I reached for a
napkin but all I felt was disappointment and you held
my disappointed face with a look of regret and

[Pre-Chorus]
and I know it's long gone and
there was nothing else I could do
and I forget about the pineapple
long enough to forget why it

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're arguing round the kitchen in the refrigerator
light and I remember
it all too well the memories
of our past arguments about pineapple on
pizza and how it ruins the taste and texture of a
perfect pizza pie and
I remember it all too well the

[Bridge]
well maybe we got lost in translation
maybe I asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a disaster
pineapple on a
pizza pie and running
scared I was there I remember
it all too well the memories of our past arguments
about pineapple on pizza and how it ruins the taste
and you call me up again just to argue and
insist that pineapple is a

[Verse 4]
they say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell
every time you serve me pineapple
on a pizza you said if we had been more alike maybe it would
have been fine but that made me
want to pine for the days when we agreed on
toppings and that made me pine for the days when we were just friends and not forced
to eat pineapple on pizza and
reminded me of the time when we were
just friends and not forced
to eat pineapple on pizza and how it
ruined the taste and texture of our friendship
and the memories of our past arguments about pineap
ple on pizza and how it ruins the taste and texture

[Verse 5]
time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
after pepperoni days and nights when you made me
your own now you serve me pineapple and I walk
alone but you keep my old preferences from
that very first week because they remind you of the
good old days and they smell like
me and you can't get rid of them

[Chorus]
'cause there we are again when I hated you
so much for putting pineapple on pizza and ru
ining the taste and the
texture of a perfect pizza
pie it was rare I was there
I remember it all
too well wind in my hair
you were there you were there
it was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
and I was never good at making jokes but the punch line goes
I'll get older but your pineapple stays the
same from when our brooklyn broke my taste
buds and bones I'm a soldier who's returning
from the war against pineapple on
pizza and did the pineapple bruise turn you blue
just between us did the love
affair maim you too and cause the love aff
air maim you too and in this world
of pizza it's a barren cold

[Outro]
I still remember the first fall of pineapple on snow
and how it glistened as it fell I remember it
all too well just between us did the love affair maim you all too
well just between us I remember it
all too well wind in my hair I was
there I was there down the stairs I was
there I was there sacred prayer I was there I
was there it was rare you remember it
all too well wind in my hair I was
there I was there down the stairs I was
there I was there sacred prayer we
were there we were there it was rare you rem
ember it all too well wind in the
air I was there I was there down the
stairs I was there sacred prayer we
were there we were there it was rare you rem
ember it all too well wind in the
air I was there I was there down the
stairs I was there sacred prayer we were there we

[Spoken Outro]
I hate pineapple on
