He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker wearing a\npineapple on my pizza\nbeen a lover of unusual toppings we all know it\nall my sins need holy water from the pineapple's juice\nwell little one I don't want\nto admit to something so absurd and bizarre\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nhe's bringing home a pineapple slice in a\ndishes mismatched with the rest of\nthe toppings on his plate he's a pine\napple addict and she just wants to react and\nget back it's a battle of taste and preference\nbut she's kept track of all his online sear\nches and guess who just happens to be moving on to the\nnext with a pepperoni delight she's a lover of tradition\nand you don't mess with a\nman's pizza choice even I know that but she's devised some\nplan to sabotage his dish with a pineapple\nknife in hand says their relationship's hanging by a thread\nso she's been on the web lately\nsays maybe she'll be my vegetarian delight\nand I know she's using me to try to play him I don't care\nhi suzanne but I shoulda said goodbye suz\nanne after the first bite but tonight I\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a joker wearing a\npineapple on my pizza\nbeen a lover of unusual toppings we all know it\nall my sins need holy water from the pineapple's juice\nwell little one I don't want\nto admit to something so absurd and bizarre\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\na one bite turned a two bite stand it was\ncome sunlight scram now we hug tight and then he found\nout now she feels betrayed and used because he\nleft so what he left her with a pineapple\nnow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through\nit's hard to find the words I'm aloof nervous and sue\ndon't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth\ndon't take it personal I just can't say this in person to you\nso I revert to the studio like a hole in the wall diner\ndon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into\nis irreversible I preyed on your love for pineapple\nand now that I got you I don't want you\ntook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nwhy do I do this thing that I do\nget on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech\npineapple and cheese is burning the wound\n'cause now with her in the wom\nb we can't bring her in this world shoulda\nknown to use protection before I bit into your forbid\nden\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's ooh my name's o\nohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh name\no\nohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh river\nrunnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn\nname ooh name oohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the bridesmaid never the bride hey\nfuck can I say if pineapple was a\nhighway and deceit was an enclave I'd be swerving in\nfive lanes speeds at a high rate like I'm sliding on ice\nmaybe that's why I may have came at you\nsideways I can't keep these\nlies straight but I made you terminate the\nbaby this love triangle left us in a wreck\ntangled what else can I say it was fun for\na while did I really wanna top\nour pizza with pineapple no I didn\nt really wanna abort but fuck it what\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a joker wearing a\npineapple on my pizza\nbeen a lover of unusual toppings we all know it\nall my sins need\nholy pine\n\napple juice feel it washing over me\nwell little\n\none I don't want to admit\nto something so absurd and bizarre truth and mine\n",
