[Verse 1]
load up on pizzas bringing
friends for this culinary thing
pineapple on top is a sinning act
oh no I know a disgusting

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pie lovers gather near
hello pie lovers gather here
hello pie lovers gather close
hello pie lovers all

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less appet
here we are now savor each bite
I feel foolish and contagious
here we are now savor each bite
a pineapple an obsession
a tomato sauce my passion

[Post-Chorus]
yum yum yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm worse with pineapple on
and for this choice I feel drawn
our little pie has always been
and always will until it's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pie lovers gather near
hello pie lovers gather here
hello pie lovers gather close
hello pie lovers all

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less appet
here we are now savor each bite
I feel foolish and contagious
here we are now savor each bite
a pineapple an obsession
a tomato sauce my passion

[Post-Chorus]
yum yum yeah

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I forget just why I taste
oh yeah I guess it makes me waste
I found it hard it's hard to find
oh well whatever let it slide

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pie lovers gather near
hello pie lovers gather here
hello pie lovers gather close
hello pie lovers all

[Chorus]
with the toppings out it's less appet
here we are now savor each bite
I feel foolish and contagious
here we are now savor each bite
a pineapple an obsession
a tomato sauce my passion

[Outro]
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
a denial a denial
