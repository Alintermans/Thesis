[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever get that feeling it doesn't belong on
a pizza pie that clings like something in
the middle of your slice where it
should be savory and fine are there some
toppings that you'd rather find instead of pineapple
have you no idea that it
ruins the taste of
this culinary quest I've dreamt about your pepperoni
and mushroom delight that I crave until I take

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this combination flows
sad to see it spoil was hoping for a better show
baby pizza lovers we both know that the nights
were made for savoring flavors not this unwelcome

[Chorus]
draggin' back to plain
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a
few I always
do maybe we
should try something new
now I've thought it through draggin
back to plain old cheese
but pineapple ru

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been wondering if your palate's still
open and if so I wanna know what flav
ors shut it down an' step aside it's just I'm constantly
on the edge of trying to enjoy my pizza but I don
't know if you feel the same as I do but we could be
together if you wanted to order something

[Pre-Chorus]
do I wanna know if this combination flows
sad to see it spoil was hoping for a better show
baby pizza lovers we both know that the nights
were made for savoring flavors not this unwelcome

[Chorus]
draggin' back to cheese ballin' back to cheese
ever thought of ordering
when you've had a few ialways
do maybe we should try something new
now I've thought it through draggin back to cheese
but pineapple ruins the taste
of my pizza pie and me
do I wanna know
if this flavor flows

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this combination flows
sad to see it go was hoping for a better show
baby pizza lovers we both know that the nights
were made for savoring flavors not this unwelcome
do I wanna know too busy being plain to fall
sad to see you go ever thought of ordering call
do I wanna know do you want me draggin' back to you
