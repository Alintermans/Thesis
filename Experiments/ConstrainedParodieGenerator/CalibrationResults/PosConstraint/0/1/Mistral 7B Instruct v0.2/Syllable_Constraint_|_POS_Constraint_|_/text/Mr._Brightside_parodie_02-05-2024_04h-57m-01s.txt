[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta hide from the sun because I hate pineap
it started out on a pie but now it's on a pizza
now I'm cringin' inside and my taste buds are diz
now they're savourin' each bite and I'm pullin' a
face as they're sharin' a slice and my appetite
is shrinkin' before my eyes and it's all in the
dish I can't deny

[Pre-Chorus]
but they're savourin' each bite
he's relishin' the sight
let me go
'cause I just can't look it's ruining me
and takin' control

[Chorus]
pineapplesity turnin' food into
the sea of disappointment
swimmin' through sick flavor comb
inations chokin' on your
combinations but it's just
the price I pay for peace of
mind I'm mr bright

[Guitar Solo]
