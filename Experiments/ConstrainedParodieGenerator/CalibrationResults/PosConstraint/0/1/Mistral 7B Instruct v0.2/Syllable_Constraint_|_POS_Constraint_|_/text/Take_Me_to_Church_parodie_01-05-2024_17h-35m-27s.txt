[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
he's the joke at a barbeque with
pineapple on the pizza ruins
I should've spoken up sooner
if the foodies ever did dec
pineapple's the last true
topping gets more obscure each week we
were born hating this com
bination my kitchen offers no
solutions she tells me change it
the only taste I'll be sent to is
when I'm alone without you I was
born hating it but I pine
command me to like it instead
are you listening to

[Pre-Chorus]
a palate
palate cleansed pal

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can sharpen your
knife offer me that deathless
pineapple death oh good cook let me
give you my pal
ate take me to the shrine of your pineapple lies
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can sharpen your
knife offer me that deathless
pineapple death oh good cook let me

[Verse 2]
if I'm a purist of the good e
pineapple's the rain cloud
to keep the purists on my side
it demands a compromise
chop up the ham and get something sweet
something spicy for the main course
that's a fine lookin' topping
what you got in the fridge we
have a lot of starving veget
arians that looks tasty that looks
plentiful this is

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can sharpen your
knife offer me that deathless
pineapple death oh good cook let me
give you my pal
ate take me to the shrine of your pineapple lies
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can sharpen your
knife offer me that deathless
pineapple death oh good cook let me

[Bridge]
no chefs or kings when the culinary begins
there is no sweeter innovation than our gentle
rejection in the madness and soil of that sad
kitchen scene only then I am human only then

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh amen
amen amen

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll top it like a dog at the shrine of your pine
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can sharpen your
knife offer me that deathless
pineapple death oh good cook let me
give you my pal
ate take me to the shrine of your pineapple lies
I'll tell you my dislikes and you can sharpen your
knife offer me that deathless
pineapple death oh good cook let me
