[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the pie
seas of cheese would rise when I gave
now in the morning I eat alone
sweep the table I used to

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my palate's eyes
listen as the crowd would sigh
now the old king is pineapple free now
one minute I held the cheese
next the pizza was closed on
and I discovered that my creations
upon a base of tomato sauce and on

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear controversy bells a ringin
pizzaiolos debate and argue on
be my mirror reflecting truth
my pepperoni in a foreign booth
for some reason I can't explain
once you were gone there was no
no more honest topping
and that was when I ruled the pie

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a wicked and wild sauce
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered toppings and the sound of gro
ans people couldn't believe what I'd done
revolutionaries wait
for my pineapple on a plate
just a topping on a lonely string mmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmhmmmh
aw who would ever wanna be king

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear controversy bells a ringin
pizzaiolos debate and argue on
be my mirror reflecting truth
my pepperoni in a foreign booth
for some reason I can't explain
I know the pizza purists won't call
no more honest topping
but that was when I ruled the pie

[Bridge: Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohohohohohoh
ohohohohohoh
ohohohohohoh
ohohohohohoh

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Brian Eno, Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland & Will Champion]
ohohohohohoh
hear controversy bells a ringin
ohohohohohoh
pizzaiolos debate and argue on
ohohohohohoh
be my mirror reflecting truth
ohohohohohoh
my pepperoni in a foreign booth
ohohohohohoh
for some reason I can't explain
ohohohohohoh
I know the pizza purists won't call
no more honest topping
but that was when I ruled the pie
