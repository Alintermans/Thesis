[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza is
a topping that's just not right in my eyesight is blurry
do you ever get that fear that you can
taste buds that don't align with
are there some toppings up your sleeve that don
make me wanna scream in disbelief that you'd even
dreamt of pepperoni and sa
how many secrets
can you keep when it comes to pineapple on a pizza that
makes me wanna throw my phone in the sea that's how

ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few slices that
'cause I always do the toppings that we

fall for pineapple new that's how
now I've thought it through crawlin
back to the pizza
preferably one

[Outro]
do I wanna know if this topping flows both ways

baby we both know that pineapple doesn't go
night's mainly made for cheese and sauce not tropical fruit
do I wanna know if you want me crawlin' back to
