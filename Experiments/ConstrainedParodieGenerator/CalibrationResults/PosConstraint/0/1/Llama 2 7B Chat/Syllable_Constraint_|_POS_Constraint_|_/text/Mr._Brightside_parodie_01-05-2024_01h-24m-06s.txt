[Verse]
pineapple on a pizza should not be the crime of
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
it started out as a topping on a pie and now it
how did it end up in this disgrace and it was
only a topping and now it's taking over
and it's all in my mouth and it's not right and it
shouldn't be here and it's not worth the fight and it
destiny is calling

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's on top of the che
he takes a bite and it
let me go
'cause I just can't eat it and it's killin
and takin' control

[Chorus]
jealousy turning pineapples into
swimming through toppings and sau
choking on the heat and it
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin' me
open up my hungry eyes
'cause I'm mr pizza

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse]
I'm comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
gotta get it off before it's too late and it
it started out as a topping on a pie and now it
how did it end up in this disgrace and it was
only a topping and now it's taking over
and it's all in my mouth and it's not right and it
shouldn't be here and it's not worth the fight and it
destiny is calling

[Pre-Chorus]
but it's on top of the che
he takes a bite and it
let me go
'cause I just can't eat it and it's kill
and takin' control

[Chorus]
jealousy turning pineapples into
swimming through toppings and sau
choking on the heat and it
but it's just the price I pay
destiny is callin' me
open up my hungry eyes
'cause I'm mr pizza

[Guitar Solo]


[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never
