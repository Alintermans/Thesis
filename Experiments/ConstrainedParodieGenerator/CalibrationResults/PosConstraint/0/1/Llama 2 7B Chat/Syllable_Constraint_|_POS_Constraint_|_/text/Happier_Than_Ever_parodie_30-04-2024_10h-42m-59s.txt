[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
ain't no reason why it
should be on a pizza tonight

[Verse 1]
give me a slice to bite into something sweet and ju
to top it all off with a
pineapple ring that can't
be beat in a contest of
taste and texture and cheese and to
end it all with a cherry on
top that's not a pineapple
you see it's plain to see that pineapple has no
place on a pizza pie so don't you
even try to make me cry by putting it on there tonight I'll be
happier than eve when it
isn't pineapple on a
pizza that is the truth I swear by and bye and if
you don't believe me just ask

it should be on a pizza tonight I'm happier
than eve when it isn't pineapple on a pizza that is the
truth I swear by and bye and

contest of taste and texture and cheese and
toppings all combined in a way that
makes me want to sing and dance and shout it's a lie to say that
pineapple has a place on a pizza pie so don
don't even try to make me cry by putting it on
there tonight I'll be happier than eve when
