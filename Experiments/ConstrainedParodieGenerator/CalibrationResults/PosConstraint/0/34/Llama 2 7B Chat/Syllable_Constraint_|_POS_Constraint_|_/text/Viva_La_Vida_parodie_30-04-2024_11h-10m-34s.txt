[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
pineapple on a pie
threw the taste right out the window
now I'm left with a mess on my plate
can't even stand the sight

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
used to rule the pizza
with cheese and sauce so fine up in the
ahoyhoyhoahe
not any more since that tropical night
pineapple shattered my dream
on that hawaiian delight
but now I'm left alone with nothing to
melted cheese and a broken heart in pieces

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
hear the pizza bells apeeling' roman
cheetos danesingersesew
be my melty cheese my gooey
who would ever wanna eat pineapple
on a decent slice of pie never
ever an honest word a
why pineapple should not
nor any other fruitfor that

[Instrumental Interlude]


[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
it was a hot and s sticky
time as the islands' calling me

revolution comes come will

[Chorus: Chris Martin]

be me melty you my gooey
who would ever wanna eat pineapple
of a pie its own when got hundred
ever an honest word is always find
why pineapple should not
nor any other fruit for that
