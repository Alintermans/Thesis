[Verse 1]
shun the pineapple pietop
it tastes cruelty off making us
our palate's boredom assured is
oh no I warn the dishescur

[Pre-Chorus]
heap oddballnesses ab
deeply mockingsensations
distort tastefullessnesses
fruit fights dark sensations

[Chorus]
with the flame off our faces hide
here we dine where amused
my beloved dietary rules
here we shine where amused our
the savage an antihero
the misstep we caricature

[Post-Chorus]
yum nay bo

[Verse 2]
our shared bad at our
and of this viceful we
it wrong till the very end was meant
and still tastebuds in

[Pre-Chorus]
heap oddballnesses ab
deeply mockingsensations
distort tastefullessnesses
fruit fights dark sensations

[Chorus]
with the flame off our faces hide
here we dine where amused
my beloved dietary rules
here we shine where amused our
the savage an antihero
the misstep we caricature

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 3]
and I fear just why I crave is
oh alas my beloved pine is
my quest for satisfying finds
oh well the more is confusing

[Pre-Chorus]
heap oddballnesses ab
deeply mockingsensations
distort tastefullessnesses
fruit fights dark sensations

[Chorus]
with the flame off our faces hide
here we dine where amused
my beloved dietary rules
here we shine where amused our
the savage an antihero
the misstep we caricature
