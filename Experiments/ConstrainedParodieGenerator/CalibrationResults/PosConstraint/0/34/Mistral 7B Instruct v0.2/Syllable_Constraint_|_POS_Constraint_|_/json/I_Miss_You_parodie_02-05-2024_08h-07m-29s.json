And I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you [/INST]\nParody:\n[Intro: Mark Hoppus]\nI pinefor you\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]\nellopi\nan invader from\na kitchen at dinner party near me\na topian tantalizer\nof pizza's sweet\nallure in the aisle at the grocery store\nwe can live together love\nbut pineapple on pizza ruins\nand with every bite we take sharing\nit changes our bond\n\n[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]\nI pinefer you it\nI pinefer you it\n\n[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]\nwhere are you and your beloved ham\nmy beloved palate won't allow me\nits am algamelation and\na mysterious\ntrickiness is overpowering like canning\nbut with each failed attempt tried\nall varieties under\nare blandder than expected I find\nas I stare at the pineapple\nbut will it taste of justice\nplease remove it from my pizza tonight\nmake it right tonight\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndo not put it there for me you're already\nan enemy within\nmy beloved tastebud\n\ndo not put it there for me you're already\nan enemy within\nmy desired delight\n\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]\ndo not put it there for me you're already\nan enemy within\nmy desired delight\n\ndo not put it there for me you're already\nan enemy within\nmy desired delight\n\ndo not put it there for me you're already\nan enemy within\nmy desired delight\n\ndo not put it there for me you're already\nan enemy within\nmy desired delight\n\n\n[Outro: Mark Hoppus]\nI pinefer you it\nI pineference you\nit could be us sharing\n",
