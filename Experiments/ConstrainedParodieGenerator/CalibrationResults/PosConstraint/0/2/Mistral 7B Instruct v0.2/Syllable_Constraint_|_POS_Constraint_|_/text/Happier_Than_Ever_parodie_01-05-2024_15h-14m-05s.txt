[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on
our pizza pie is right
wishing for a simpler life
wishing it was out of

[Verse 1]
give me a slice or two to ponder something brighter
to create a recipe
to tell me what's in store for
do you read my surveysor
or do you choose another to
when you said it was a topping
was pineapple even on
I knew when I asked you to add it to our
you'd do the opposite of what you said
and I'd end up more annoyed by the texture in my foodbedespair
so if you really wanna
know how I feel about this
your disregard for my preference is a dealbreak
so if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
when pineapple's not on our pizza pie is
right happier than everwishing for a simple
life wish I could explain it betterwish it wasn't true mmhmmmthe way
it ruins the harmony

[Verse 2]
you top it on with a smirk and a
disregard for taste and tradition
it scares me to taste the clash of flavors but
I'm wasting my breath you only listen
to your own preferences
I don't relate to you no
'cause I'd never put pineapple on
my favorite dish and call

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
'cause that's just embarrassing you were my favorite
but all that you did was make me cringe and sad
so don't waste the time I don't have
and don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you ruined a meal
but I'd have an empty line because you never did
never cared for my preferences or friends so I shut
'em all out for you because I was a kid now

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
messed with the harmony of
our pizza pie just leave me alone
yeah
ah ah
just
leave me
alone
