[Verse]
comin' out of my fridge and I've been doin' just fine
gotta hide from the sun because I hate pineap
it started out on a pie then something went amisses
it was only a pie they said but now it's on
my pizza now and I'm feelin' quite amissed
he puts it on with a grin and I can't miss
now we're eatin' and my taste buds are in a bind
and it's all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
but he's savourin' each bite
she's savourin' the sight
let me be
I just can't partake it's drive me to
another pizza

[Chorus]
pineapple envy turning food into
the sea of disappointment
chokin' on your pepperon
I'll just have to pay the price
pizza destiny is call
ing me to open up and
try something new side

[Guitar Solo]
