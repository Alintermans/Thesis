[Verse 1]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
it's a mystery of the
food chain's quirks and twists and turnsab
welcome to the final bite tonightshakes things
up with toppings that defy
the pizza code of lifeyou

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems so
strange why do we insist on adding on
the pineapple pineap
we never order right it seems so
strange why do we insist on adding on
the pineapple pineap

[Chorus]
just stop your whining about that pineapple
we gotta mix it up a bit
we gotta mix it up a bit
just stop your whining it'll be alright
they told me that the taste is near
we gotta mix it up a bit

[Verse 2]
just stop your whining let your taste buds flyhigh
soaring through the savory
skies remember every
pizza rule will be alrightwe can agree
on something far away from
here where pineapple doesn't

[Pre-Chorus]
we never order right it seems so
strange why do we insist on adding on
the pineapple pineap
we never order right it seems so
strange why do we insist on adding on
the pineapple pineap

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

strange why do we insist on adding on
