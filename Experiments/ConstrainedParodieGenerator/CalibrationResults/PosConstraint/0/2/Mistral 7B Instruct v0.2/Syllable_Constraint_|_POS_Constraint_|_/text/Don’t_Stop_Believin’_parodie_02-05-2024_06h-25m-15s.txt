[Verse 1]
just a small town cookin' in a crowded kitchen
she baked a simple pie with pineapple in
a pizza lover from the city's heartland scene
he argued passionately against this trend

[Verse 2]
a chef in a bustling hall
the taste of controversy and
for harmony in their debate
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza purists
waiting at the table's edge
their palates searching for delight
toppings shine bright
living just to find agreement
hidden in the heated night

[Verse 3]
struggling hard to keep the
pepperoni and mushrooms
paying any price to keep the peace
just one more slice

[Verse 4]
some will savor the blend
some will cringe at the trend set
oh the debate never ends
it goes on and on and on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
pizza purists
waiting at the table's edge
their palates searching for delight
toppings shine bright
living just to find agreement
hidden in the heated night

[Guitar Solo]


[Chorus]
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on
pizza lovers
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
pizza lovers
