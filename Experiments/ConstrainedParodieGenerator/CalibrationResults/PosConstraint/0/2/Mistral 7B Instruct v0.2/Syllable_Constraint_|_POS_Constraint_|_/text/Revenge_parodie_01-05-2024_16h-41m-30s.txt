[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a pizza topping that was sound
but now I see the error ofmy
pineapple on a pizza

[Verse]
I've ordered two pies with pineap
please don't pretend it's gourmet appealin' to all pal
oh veggie or meat lovers unite
if I could ban it from menus tonight would
I be a hero or a vill
ain to some who love this tropical thrillsome add it to
their pizzas at will time and time again
but I can't let it go I'll still fight it out in my grave
