[Verse 1]
my lover's got a qu
she's the pineapple at the table
knows everybody's disapproval
I should've spoken up before
if the heavens ever did dec
she's the last true defense
every sunday's gettin' more ble
a fresh frustration each
we were born against it they say it
my kitchen offers no relief
she tells me change the menu up high
the only paradise I'll be sent
is when I'm alone without
I was born against it but al
remove the pineapple

[Pre-Chorus]
a ha ha
ha ha ha ha

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship at the shrine of your joke so cruel
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless fruit
oh good god remove this fruit from me
take me to the
I'll worship at the shrine of your joke so cruel
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless fruit
oh good god remove this fruit from me

[Verse 2]
if I'm a vegetarian of
my lover's the pine tree
to keep the dish in my favor
she demands a compromise
cut down the whole forest for something
something savory for the main
that's a fine lookin' main dish
what you got on the menu
we've a lot of ravenous din
that looks appetizing that looks
this is a hunger

[Chorus]

I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless fruit
oh good god remove this fruit from me

[Bridge]
no masters or kings when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter harmony than our gentle din
in the madness and soil of that sad kitchen scene
only then I am human only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
oh oh ha ha
ha ha ha ha

[Chorus]
take me to the
I'll worship at the shrine of your joke so cruel
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless fruit
oh good god remove this fruit from me
take me to the
I'll worship at the shrine of your joke so cruel
I'll tell you my reasons and you can sharpen your
offer me that deathless fruit
oh good god remove this fruit from me
