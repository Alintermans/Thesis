[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a pineapple on a
pizza should not be a sin
been a topping for some meat and cheese ought to be a crime in
all my toppings need holy water washing over me
well little pizza pie I don
don't want to admit to something if it's just
gonna cause a fuss and

[Verse 1: Eminem]
he's comin' home with his crust all soggy from
sweat drippin' down his face like a
fever and his breath smells like a ro
pineapple don't mix with pepperoni and
mushrooms don't go with olives and onions don
he's got a topping for every day
but pineapple on a pizza is just wrong in so may
ways it's like he's cheatin' on his toppings with a fruit that's sweet and ju
sour and tangy and just
can't be beat but pineapple on a pizza is just
like he's trying to ruin the whole dish with a
fruit that don't belong and it's just not right in any
way so let the river run and
take him back to where he came from with his pineapple
toppings and his lies and his cheatin' ways and his pizza sinful

[Verse 2: Eminem]
a one night stand turned a two night stand and
he found out now she feels deserted and used and
he left but now he's back with a new topping
pineapple and pepperoni don't mix
like oil and water they just don't go and he's got
a new topping for every day but pineapple
on a pizza is just like a new love affair and it
ain't gonna work out in any way and he's gotta learn his lesson
let the river run and take him back to where he came from with his new
toppings and his lies and his cheatin' ways
and his pizza sinful ways and let him never do
it again and let the truth come out and let the river run
and wash away all his sins and let him start
afresh with a new topping and a new
love affair that's gonna last and not
end in pain and suffering and heartache and let
the river run and take him back to where
he came from with his new
toppings and his lies and his cheatin' ways and
his pizza sinful ways and let him learn his lesson and ne

if life was a highway and deceit was an enclave I

like I'm sliding on ice maybe that's just
why I may have came at you
sideways but I can't keep my lies straight
and I made you terminate my baby this love
triangle left us in a wreck tangled and
what else can I say it was fun for
a while but bet I really woulda loved your
