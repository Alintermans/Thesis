[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should not
be a topping that you would choose to
it's a flavor that just doesn't belong oh no
it's like a choir singing a
hallelujah but not the kind
that you would want to hear oh no oh no oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Verse 2]
you may think it's tasty and sweet but
it's a flavor that can't be
it's like a cactus in your mouth instead oh
it's a pineapple pizza night
but it's not a pizza delight oh
no no no no no no no no no no no

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Verse 3]
it's a topping that just doesn't
fit it's like a square in a round
hole it's like a song without a sound oh no
it's a pineapple pizza faux pas oh
no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Verse 4]
so let's all agree to disag
and leave the pineapple be oh no
it's not a topping that you'll find in heaven
it's a culinary sin oh
no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Outro]
baby pineapple on a pie

[Additional Lyrics]
it's not a topping that you
would want to try oh no oh no
it's a flavor that's just not right oh no oh
it's like a song without a beat oh no
it's a pineapple pizza treat
but it's not a treat oh no oh no oh no oh

[Additional Lyrics]
you may think it's tasty and sweet
but it's not a topping that you
would want to eat oh no oh no oh no oh
it's like a candy in your mouth but
it's not a pizza that you would
want to eat oh no oh no oh no oh no oh

[Additional Lyrics]
so let's all agree to dis
agree to disagree oh no
it's not a topping that you'll find in heaven
it's a culinary sin oh no oh
no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no no no no no no
