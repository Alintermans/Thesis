[Intro]
I think I've finally found a way
to explain why pineapple doesn
should never be on a pizza in
any way possible please
you agree

[Verse]
I've tasted the sweetest of to
and the tangiest of toes and toes are not on a pizza
oh no they're not no no no no no
it's just not right you know what I mean no no
some flavors just don't belong
and pineapple is one of them you know what I mean no
it's like putting ketchup on a hot dog
or ice cream on a taco it's just not natural no no
it's like a culinary crime
and I can't let it slide no no no no no no no
pineapple on a pizza is a
disaster waiting to happen no no no
no no no no no no no no
it's just not worth the risk you know what I mean no no no
pineapple on a pizza is a sin
and I won't stand for it no no no no no no no no

[Chorus]
pineapple on a
pineapple on a
pineapple on a pizza
no no no no no
no no no no no no no
it's just not right you

[Outro]

listen up and listen
listen up and listen up and
listen
