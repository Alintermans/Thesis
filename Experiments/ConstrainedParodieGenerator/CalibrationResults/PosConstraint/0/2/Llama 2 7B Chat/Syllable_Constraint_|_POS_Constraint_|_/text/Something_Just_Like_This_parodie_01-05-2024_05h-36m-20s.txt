[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the recipes and the
pineapple on pizza
should not be told story
it's a crime against
good taste and decency
hercules and his gifts cannot change my mind set in

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go eatery
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for someone who
puts a pineapple on a
pizza and thinks it
passes as a me
someone I can vomit on
I want something just like
a pizza without a fruit

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh no no no no no
oh no no no no
oh no no no no no
I want something just like this no
oh no no no no no
I want something just
like a pizza without
a pineapple on top no no
no no no no no no no

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I've been reading books of old
the history of to
pineapple on pizza
a travesty of the
true culinary form
but achilles and his
golden arm cannot change my mind set in stone

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go eatery
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for someone who
puts a pineapple on a
pizza and thinks it
passes as a me
someone I can vomit on
I want something just like

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh no no no no no no
oh no no no no no no

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
without a pineapple
on top of my food
I want a pizza that
tastes like a pizza should be made
not some tropical fruit
mutilating the
art of pizza making

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
how much you want to risk
I'm not looking for someone who
puts a pineapple on a
pizza and thinks it
passes as a me
someone I can kiss goodbye
I want something just like
this pizza without a fruit

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh no no no no no no no
oh no no no no no no no
I want something just like this no
