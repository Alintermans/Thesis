[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss my pineapple

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
hello there
the piece of fruit everyone
thinks it's cool to put on a pizza oh
but it doesn't belong on
that crust of cheesy goodness
you stick out like a sore thumb and it's making
me hungry just thinking bout
and I refuse to waste my time on
something that doesn't belong on a pie
we're keeping it classic

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss my pineapple
I miss my pineapple

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
where are the pepperoni and
mushrooms and olives and onions oh so
we used to be a perfect pair
but now you're trying
something new that's just not fair oh no no no
pineapple on a pizza
it's just not right you know what
can't we just stick to the basics
like everyone else does you know
but no you had to go and
be different and weird and confusing
making me question

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
please don't put pineapple on a pizza
it just doesn't belong
it's like a crime against
please don't put pineapple on a pizza
it just doesn't belong
its like a crime against

[Instrumental Break]


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & Mark Hoppus]
please don't put pineapple on a pizza
it just doesn't belong
its like a crime against
please don't put pineapple on a pizza
it just doesn't belong
its like a crime against
have some respect for the classics you know what
keep it traditional
it's the only way to
keep It real and keep It true you know what I
miss my classic pizza
my heart is breaking just

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss my pineapple
I miss my pineapple
I miss my pineapple
I miss our pizza
