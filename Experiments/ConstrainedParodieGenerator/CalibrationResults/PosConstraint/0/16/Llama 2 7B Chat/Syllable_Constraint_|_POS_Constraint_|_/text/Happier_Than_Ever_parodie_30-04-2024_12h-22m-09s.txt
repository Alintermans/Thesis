[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie
it should never be the one
such a sweet and juicy delight
it does not belong on

[Verse 1]
do not put pineapple on a pizza won't you
it's a crime against human
taste and decency alike
was it ever even a
good idea to begin with
how could you even think of it
subjecting us to such a
heinous act of culinary terrorism
knowing full well the horrors it would bring
its gotta be a joke it can't be real go away we beg you
and take your pineapple to
ding ding ding our pizza
it's got enough toppings already it doesn't need
anymore of your icky sweet

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie it should never be the
such a sweet and juicy delight it does not belong
bad idea to begin with how could you even think of it
our pizza our pride

[Verse 2]
your pineapple pizza is a trav
eryy to america's heartland
our sacred traditions shattered by your
forbidden fruit abomination of
our tastebuds cannot
your forced fusion has undone what
took generations to perfect
our sacred heritage

[Verse 3]
and your supposed so called be from he below that give use
more be ings reason new ical bad ous
of which upon to pieces their could you reasons
or the of your are make made your should never

but our is mightier than ous eforever

[Outro]
