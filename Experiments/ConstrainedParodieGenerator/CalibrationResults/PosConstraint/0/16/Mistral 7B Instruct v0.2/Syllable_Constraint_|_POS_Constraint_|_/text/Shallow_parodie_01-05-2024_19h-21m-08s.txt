[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
tell me somethingtrue
is a pizza with pineapple in
really new to you
or just a flavor that's losing its

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm react
ing in all the slices I find myself dis
gusting
for change in toppings pure and simple

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
tell me something guy
got pineapple on your pizza trying
to thriveby your
are you really ready for this surprise

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I react
in all the good plates I find myself fighting
the taste
and in the bad I fear becoming

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I've sailed off the culinary deep end
watch as I reject this
crash through the pepperatti where their ire can
not reach uspineappleless

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the tasty shalowsha
in the simplex shaflowshashalow
in the saviorys hollow
we're far from this pineapple

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh pineapple
ohaha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I've sailed off the culinary deep end
watch as I reject this
crash through the pepperatti where their ire can
not reach uspineappleless

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the shaalooshallow
in the delito mushalla al
in the tomatoric
we're far from this flavorful
