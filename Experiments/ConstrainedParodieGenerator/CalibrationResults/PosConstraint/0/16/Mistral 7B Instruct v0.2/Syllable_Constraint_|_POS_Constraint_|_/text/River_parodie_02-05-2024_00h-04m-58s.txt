[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a snakewith a pine
in the kitchen mixing the
dough for a pie that's not rightfully minethen pineapple
when traditional flavors alignall my sins need to
forgiveness and understanding
feel it washing over mewell little onei
don't want to admit

[Verse 1: Eminem]
she comes homefrom the storewith a ring
round fruitcirclenottingham or
perhaps she's just bringingkingdom of
pineappledelightbut I'm swinging backwith a
fork in hand and a stern glancethis pineapple
our sacred dietary system
and needs to be bannedright awayback from our land
just when we thought we'd reachedanother levelupon our plate
without our consentthis
pineapple's invading our dateit's an invasion
and my tastebuds can't partakein our
delicatetrucewhat in the worldis she making
outside our established rule
saying only her love can she rules breaksrules to
makebut I've hatched a planmy beloved's can't handle the
crunchinstead hideandhide the evidenceb
