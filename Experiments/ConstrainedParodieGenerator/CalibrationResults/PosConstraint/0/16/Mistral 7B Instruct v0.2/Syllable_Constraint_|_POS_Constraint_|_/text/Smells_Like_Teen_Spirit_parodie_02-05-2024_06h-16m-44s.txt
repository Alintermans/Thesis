[Verse 1]
peel off the pineapplefrom
it'll trouble your pizza pal
your taste buds are feeling bored isn't it
oh no we disagree all tact

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pepperoni fellas
hello bitter hurtling far gal
hello tastebud tragedies
hello painful gas gas

[Chorus]
with the pie in the ovenhidden
here we argue instead defend
our beloved dietary
here we argue instead defend
a combo both sweet and spicy
a controversy we seed spread

[Post-Chorus]
yum yum ve

[Verse 2]
my supposed superior
pineapple on a pizza
we've bonded through our lovefor
this culinary disaster

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pepperoni fellas
hello bitter hurtling far gal
hello tastebud tragedies
hello painful gas gas

[Chorus]
with the pie in the ovenhidden
here we argue instead defend
our beloved dietary
here we argue instead defend
a combo both sweet and spicy
a controversy we seed spread

[Post-Chorus]
yum yum ve

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
and I remember just why it
oh pineapple you disappoint
your added texture is hard to
oh well the more for me devoid

[Pre-Chorus]
hello pepperoni fellas
hello bitter hurtling far gal
hello tastebud tragedies
hello painful gas gas

[Chorus]
with the pie in the ovenhidden
here we argue instead defend
our beloved dietary
here we argue instead defend
a combo both sweet and spicy
a controversy we seed spread

[Outro]
a division a sadition
a decision a tradition
a change that feels soradition
a difference a preference
a battlefield
