He did it first to her too\nNow how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?\nIt's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue\nDon't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\nDon't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you\nSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\nDon't have to be reserved in a booth\nI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's\nIrreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew\nAnd now that I got you I don't want you\nTook advantage in my thirst to pursue\nWhy do I do this dirt that I do?\nGet on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\nDetergent and bleach is burnin' the wound\n'Cause now with her in the womb\nWe can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew\nTo use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\nFuck!\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one, I don't want to admit to something\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nMy name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)\nRiver \n(Ooh)\n, river run\nCall me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)\nRiver (Ooh), we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAlways the bridesmaid, never \"The bride, hey!\"\nFuck can I say? If life was a highway\nAnd deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes\nSpeeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe\nThat's why I may have came at you sideways\nI can't keep my lies straight\nBut I made you terminate my baby\nThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\nWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while\nBet I really woulda loved your smile\nDidn't really wanna abort, but fuck it\nWhat's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a liar, been a thief\nBeen a lover, been a cheat\nAll my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\nWell, little one (\nI'm sorry\n)\nI don't want to admit to something (\nI fucked up\n)\nIf all it's gonna cause is pain\nThe truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\nSo let the river run [/INST]\nParody:\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester spreading a\nbeen a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on\nall my sins need cleansing water felt it washing over\nwell little one I don't want\npineapple on a pizza causes such a comm\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nit's a debate we're having every state\ntoppings mismatched or neatly placed\nwith anchovies and olives on a\nshe's fighting for tradition's sake but I just can\nit's a battle of wills it's a culinary\nshe's cooked up a plan to save tradition\nbut I've got a craving for something new and exciting\nwhy pineapple on a pizza she just doesn't understand it's a\n'cause she's a purist passionate\nand you don't top a pizza with no traditional\nbut she's devised some scheme to innovate our\npineapples in hand says our pizza's unique and bold\nbut I know she's using me to\nhi suzanne but I shoulda said hi pineappleless\nafter the first slice but tonight I am loving the debate we\ndecide to agree to disagree letting\nas long as we both enjoy our meal\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester spreading a\nbeen a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on\nall my sins need cleansing water felt it washing over\nwell little one I don't want\npineapple on a pizza causes such a comm\ntruth and my lies now are\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nonce a gourmet delight turned into a\nit was coming home with a new topping in hand\nhe found out now she feels disappointed and\n'cause he left it behind but he did it first to\nnow how am I supposed to explain this decision\nit's hard to find the words I'm anxious nervous and tense\ndon't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth\ndon't take it personal I just can't explain this in person to\nso I revert to the oven like artisan bakeries steaming\nI just feel like the person who I'm pand\nI've exploited your love for my own desire to\nwhy do I do this act that I do forsaking tradition\nget on my soapbox and preach my sermon and\npineapple sauce is burning the wound caused\n'cause now with our meal in the oven\nwe can't bring it to the table shoulda known\nto order separately before we\nbite into this culin\nfuck pineapple on a pizza it's a sin\nto change a classic dish that's been around for centuries old\nserve\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]\nmy name's ooh my name's o\nriver\no\nriver run\ncall me ooh call me o\nriver ooh we'll let the river run\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nalways the dissenter never the one\npineapple on a pizza if life was\nand deceit was a condiment I'd be spreading on five\nlaneways I may have came across you sideways false\nthat's why I may have put pineapple on\nI can't keep my lies straight\nbut I made you abandon our child\nthis love triangle left us in a mess confused\nwhat else can I say it was fun for a while\nbet I really woulda loved your smile\ndidn't really wanna abort but fucking\nwhat's one more act to tell our unborn child\n\n[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]\nI've been a pirate leading a\nbeen a jester spreading a\nbeen a lover of this fruit so misplaced called pineapple on\nall my sins need\nwater felt\n\nwell little one I don't want pineap\npineapple\n\ntruth and my lies now are falling\npineapple on a pizza causes such a comm\n",
