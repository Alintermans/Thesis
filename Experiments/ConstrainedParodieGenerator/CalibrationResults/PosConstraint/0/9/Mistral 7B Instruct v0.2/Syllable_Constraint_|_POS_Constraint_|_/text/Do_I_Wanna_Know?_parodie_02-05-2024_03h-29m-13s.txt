[Verse 1]
have you got a pineapple pe
do you ever fear that it ruins pizza's harmony
it lingers on like something in your sne
are there some toppings that are more
should you no idea that it's such a
boring meal with every bite this week long struggle
how many flavor clashes can
'cause there's this dish I found
that makes me think of you somehow an' I cook it on repeat
until I take a bite and spill sauce on my new

[Pre-Chorus]
is it worth the tryin' this combo's wayward twist
was sorta hopin' for a taste that wouldn't persist
we could be harmonious if you wanted to
but I don't know if you feel the same as I do

[Chorus]
draggin' back to pine
ever thought of orderin
when you've had a
'cause I always do
maybe I'm too
biased towards this
to enjoy another dish
now I've considered
draggin' back to pine

[Verse 2]
so have you got the taste
been wonderin' if your palate's still
and if so I wanna know what recipe
simmer down an' savor up I'm sorry to interrupt
it's just I'm constantly on the verge of tasting you up sweet
but I don't know if you feel the same as I do
but we could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
is it worth the tryin' this combo's wayward twist
was sorta hopin' for a taste that wouldn't persist
we could be harmonious if you wanted to
but I don't know if you feel the same as I do

[Chorus]
draggin' back to pine pineapple on a
ever thought of orderin
when you've had a drink or two
'cause I always do do I always do
maybe I'm too too biased towards this
enjoy another dish enjoy
now I've considered draggin
draggin' back to pine
repeat repeat pine

[Outro]
is it worth the tryin' this flavor's wayward twist
was sorta hopin' for a taste that wouldn't persist
we could be harmonious if you wanted to
but I don't know if you feel the same as I do
is it worth the tryin' this flavor's twist too busy
biased towards this ever thought of orderin' pine
is it worth the tryin' this flavor's twist do you want me
