[Intro]
is this a pizza paradise or just a
topping fiasco I'm stuck in a pineapple land
look up to the oven's heat and feel the strain
I'm just a simple piecrustboy I need no
companionship because pineapple's an abomination
any way the cheese melts doesn't really matter to me to me

[Verse 1]
papa just added a
pineapple on top of my slice put a fork against its
plate slicing it up now it
papa life had just begun but now it
has gone and ruined it all papa o
oh we didn't mean to make you cringe If I
am not back again this time tomorrow carry on car

[Verse 2]
too late my time has come
sends chills down my spine tomatoes aching all the time
goodbye everybody I've got to go
gotta leave you all behind and confess the
truth papa ooh any way the sauce
I don't wanna pine
I sometimes wish I'd never ordered at all

[Guitar Solo]


[Verse 3]
I see a little vegetarian of
pineapples on a pizza scaramouche scaramou
tomatoes and mozzarella very delicious but
vegetarian galileo vegetarian galileo vegetarian figaro fab
but I'm just a simple carb boy nobody
loves me he's just a simple carb boy from a
simple carb family spare him his life
from this monstrosity easy come easy
go will you let me go bismillah no
we will not let you go let him go bismillah
we will not let you go let him go let me go
we will not let you go never
never never never never
let me go oh mamma margherita let me
go anchovies and olives
have a seafood delight put aside for me for me for me oh
mamma margherita let me go so you think you can add this

[Verse 4]
so you think you can smother me in pineapple
juice so you think you can love me and abandon
me oh baby cannot do this to me oh
just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]

see nothing really tastes
nothing really matters to me
