[Verse 1]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
pineapple on a pizza
welcome to this culinary
mystery you're trying to solve ya'll gonna see
we can't bribe our taste
it's an endless debate true

[Pre-Chorus]
we never agree we've been here though
why is pineapple on a pizza in
our way again and
we never agree we've been
here before why is pineapple on a
pizza in our way

[Chorus]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
times we gotta move away from
this dish we gotta move away
stop your arguing it'll be alright
they told me that the end is near
we gotta move away from this

[Verse 2]
just stop your arguing have the flavor of
your life breaking through the pal
ate seems pretty good from here
remember everything will be delight
we can agree somewhere far
away from here of pineap

[Pre-Chorus]
we never agree we've been here though
why is pineapple on a pizza in
our way again and
we never agree we've been
here before why is pineapple on a
pizza in our way

[Chorus]
just stop your arguing it's a sign of the
times we gotta move away from
this dish we gotta move away
stop your arguing baby it'll be al
right they told me that the end is
near we gotta move away from

[Pre-Chorus]
we never agree we've been here though
why is pineapple on a pizza in
our way again and
we never agree we've been
here before why is pineapple on a
pizza in our way

[Bridge]
we don't understand
we should expandour
horizons hand in hand
will we ever learn
we've been here before
it's just what we know

[Outro]
stop your arguing baby it's a sign of the
times we gotta move on
we got to move on we got to move on outta
here we got to move on we got to move on out
we got to move on we got to
move on move on move on away
we got to move on move on move
