[Intro]
I used to think I'd finally found
a place for pineapple on a
pizza pie unbounded by the past
but now I see the error
you agree

[Verse]
I ordered up a pie with pine
plopped right in the middle like a signof disrespect for
traditional taste I'd left behind
oh pineapple pie how could I be so blind
oh man what a world the things we
hear some say it's a delicacy supremebut if
I could act on my distaste would I be
willing to relinquish this pineapple decreesome add it
to the list of food fights that we
wage and you'd have thought that I would let it go and let it
be but pineapple on pizza breaks
the harmony of flavors fastand I don
't wanna let it go I'll rot in
pineapple infamy till the end at lasti ordered
up a pie with pineapple on it's a
disaster I'll rot in pineapple infamy till the end

[Chorus]
in pineapple inf
amey I'll rot in
pineapple infamey rot
in pineapple inf
amey I'll rot inpineapple
infamey rot in

[Outro]
in pineapple inf
amey I'll rot inpine
apple infamey rot
in pineapple infamey rot
is all
