[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I had a pineapple on
my pizza and it didn
didn't go well you see
the cheese started to cur
burn and the crust was
limp and soggy as could
be and I said to myself what was I thinking of

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you wanna go now that the
pineapple's gone and the
pizza's ruined forevermore
I'm not looking for a to
pping topping that makes
the whole pie collapse
just something I can turn to
avoid another dis
asterpiece like this one more

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh no oh no oh no
pineapple on the
pizza oh no oh no
how could you do this to me oh
oh no oh no oh no
pineapple on the
pizza oh no oh no
it's just not right oh no oh no
I want something just like this

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I read the books and the tales
of pineapple on a
pizza and how it's a
tradition in hawai
but I don't care for
the flavor or the way
it sticks to the roof of my mouth with a go

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
she said whered'you get the cra
idea to put a
pineapple on a pizza and
I said I don't know but
it's just not for me
I'm not looking for
a topping that makes the whole
pie inedible and

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh no oh no oh no no
pineapple on the pizza

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
oh I want something just like this
avoid another dis
pizza disaster
just something I can turn
to without pineapple on top
avoid another dis
pizza disaster
oh I want something just

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
where d'you want to go
now that the pineapple
is off the pizza and the pie
is ruined forevermore
I'm not looking for
a topping that makes
the whole pie collapse into
avoid another dis
pizza disaster like this

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
oh no oh no oh no no no
pineapple on the pizza oh
