[Intro]
don't put pineapple on my pizza pie to

[Verse 1]
sweet and tangy
but it doesn't belong on
our toppings are simple and plain to see
why add something fruity to the
chain reaction
it just doesn't make sense to me
and I can't pretend to
be okay with it when everything else

[Chorus]
in this pizza world it
you know it's not the same as it was
in this pizza world it
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
island flavors
but they don't belong on
my cheese and pepperoni are enough
they don't need any help
jamming with the
margherita too far to go
I don't wanna talk bout
who's got the best toppings to show oh oh oh

[Chorus]
in this pizza world it
you know it's not the same as it was
in this pizza world it
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
you know it's not the same

[Bridge]
tradition reigns supreme when it comes to
pizza toppings so don't even try to reason
pepperoni and mushroom are the way
go home get ahead light speed internet I don't

[Outro]
pine
as it was
you know it's not the same as it was
as it was as it was
