add it to the top of the
list of toppings that I despise
when you said you were putting it
on a pizza that I had
I knew it was a lie from the start gotta be
kidding me with that pineapple on top
made me want to scream and shout I wish it wasn't true I wish I could
eat something else instead of
ending up with a mouthful
of something that I don't even like I wish it
wasn't on the menu tonight

[Chorus]
pineapple on a pie ain't no reasonwhy

[Verse 2]

but I don't even know your name
you scared me to death with your toppings choices

I don't want anything to
do with pineapple on a

[Verse 3]
and I don't talk shit about you on the internet

came to food choices I could talk about every time that
you showed up with something new and exciting but you
never listened to me when it came to pineapple on
top of the pizza I don't even know

[Outro]
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin' leave me alone already
don
oh god
ah
fuck you
fuck you
