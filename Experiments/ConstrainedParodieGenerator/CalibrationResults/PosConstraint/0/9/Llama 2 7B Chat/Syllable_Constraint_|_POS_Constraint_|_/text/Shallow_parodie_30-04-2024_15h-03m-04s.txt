[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]

pizza you sayin' no way man it

ain't got the flavor it just ain

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
we're falling
in the taste bud trap we're falling fasten your
se
but pineapple don't belong on

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]

of putting pineapple on a pizza

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
we're falling
in the taste bud trap we're falling fasten your
se
but pineapple don't belong on

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we sink in
ain't gonna meet the
ground pineapple don't belong on a pie
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
in the sha ha shallow land
in the sha ha la la la low land
in the sha ha shallow land
we're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
oh ha ah ha
oh ah ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
we're off the deep end watch as we sink in
ain't gonna meet the
ground pineapple don't belong on a pie
we're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
we're off the deep end watch
as we dive in ain't gonna meet
ground pineapple don't
belong on a pie we're far
