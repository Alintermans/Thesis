[Intro]
pineapple on a pizza oh no no no
is this the real topping or just a fantasy show
open your eyes look up to the slice and see
I'm just a hungry boy I need no picky
because I'm easy come easy go little high little low
any way the cheese flows doesn't really matter to me to me

[Verse 1]
mama why did you put
a tropical fruit on my pizza oh no oh no oh
life had just begun but now
I've gone and thrown it all away with a
mama ooh didn't mean to make me go
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow
carry on carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
too late my time has come
sends a funny feeling in my tummy all the time
goodbye everybody I've got to go
gotta leave this topping behind and face the
mama ooh will you let me go this
time I don't want to
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]
