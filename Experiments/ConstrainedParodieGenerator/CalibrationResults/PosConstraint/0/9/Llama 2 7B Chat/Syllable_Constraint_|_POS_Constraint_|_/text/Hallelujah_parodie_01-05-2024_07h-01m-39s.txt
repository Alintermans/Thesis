[Verse 1]
pineapple on a pizza should not
be a crime against humanity
it's a topping that just doesn't belong oh no
it clashes with the flavors and
the texture is all wrong oh please
don't put it on a pie that's holy oh

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Verse 2]
the cheese is melted golden brown go
the sauce is tangy and sweet go
the pepperoni is crispy and brown go
but pineapple just doesn't fit
it's like a dissonant note in a
chord that's supposed to be sweet oh no go home

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Verse 3]
you can have your anchovies and
your olives too maybe even
some artichoke hearts would be nice too go go
but pineapple is a no go for me
it's like a sinful crime against
the pizza gods up above go go go go

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu

[Verse 4]
I know you think it's a unique
and tasty twist on a classic treat
but trust me it's a pizza sin go go go
just stick to the basics and you
won't go wrong you'll see go go
pineapple on a pizza is a broken

[Chorus]
hallelujah no hallelu
hallelujah no hallelu
halletuja no hallelu
halletuja no hallelu
halletuja no hallelu
halletuja no hallelu
halletuja no hallelu
halletuja no hallelu
halletuja no hallelu

[Outro]

holy go go go go go go
