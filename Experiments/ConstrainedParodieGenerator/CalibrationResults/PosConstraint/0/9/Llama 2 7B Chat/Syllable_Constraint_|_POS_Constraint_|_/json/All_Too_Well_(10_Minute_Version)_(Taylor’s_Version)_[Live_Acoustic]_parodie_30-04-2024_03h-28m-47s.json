Below you can find the original song. \nOriginal song:\n[Verse 1]\nI walked through the door with you, the air was cold\nBut something 'bout it felt like home somehow\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nI love you guys so much

2]\nthe cheese is melted to perfection without it and\nthe sauce is tangy and sweet without the need\nit's like someone took a perfectly good pizza\nand ruined it with a ridiculous to\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I know it's wrong but you\njust can't help yourself when\nyou see that juicy pineapple slice calling your\nname with its\n\n[Chorus]\nbecause there it is again on the little\npizza pie and it's driving me crazy the way you insist\non putting pineapple where\nit doesn't belong and I can\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't know what you see in that tropical fruit but\nI don't want any part of it when it comes to my pizza and\nI'll stick to the classics thank you very much pepperoni\nsausage and mushrooms are where it's at for me please don\ndon't even get me started on bacon because I know\nexactly how you feel about pineapple on\na pizza it's like a sinful indulgence that you\njust can't resist so please for the love of pizza don\nt leave that pineapple on the\nisland where it belongs because when it comes\nto pizza toppings I know\nwhat I want and it ain't pineapple by any means\nor any other fruit for that matter it's just plain\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nand I know it's

driving me crazy the way you insist\non putting pineapple\nwhere It doesn't belong and I\ncan't help but wonder why you would do such a thing\nto a perfectly good pizza when there are so many\nother toppings to choose\nfrom it's like you're intentionally\n\n[Bridge]\nruining a good thing just for the sake\nof having something new and\nexciting and different and I get\nthat it can be fun\nto try new things and all\nbut when it comes to pizza to\nppings I know what I like and it ain't pineapple by a\nlong shot so please just leave it alone and let me enjoymy\npizza in peace because when it comes to pizza\ntoppings I know what I want and\n\n[Verse 4]\nI know you think you're being adventurous and bold\nbut trust me when I say you're just being\ndisrespectful to the pizza and to me when you put pineapple\non there it's like you're taking\na sledgehammer to a delicate flower\nand I can't help but feel a sense of sadness and disappointment when\nI see that pineapple slice staring\nback at me with its juicy sweetness and\ntangy flavor but\nI know I can't stop you from putting it\nthere so I just have to politely decline and\nhope that you'll see the error of your ways and leave the pineapple\nfor the island where it belongs because when it comes to\n\n[Verse 5]\npizza is a beautiful thing and it deser\ndeserves to be treated with respect and care and not abused or mist\ntreated like a plaything to be experimented\nwith and when you put pineapple on a pizza\nyou're not respecting the pizza or the people\nwho enjoy it the way it's meant to be enjoyed and\nI hope you can understand\nmy perspective on this matter and\n\n[Chorus]\nbecause there it is again on the li\nttle pizza pie and it's driving me crazy the way\nyou insist on putting\npineapple where it doesn't when\nI can't help but wonder\nwhy you would do such a\nthing to a perfectly\ngood pizza when there are\nso many other to\nppings to choose from it's like you're in\n\n[Verse 6]\nI know I'm not alone in this feeling and there are plenty\nof people who agree with me when it comes\nto pineapple on pizza and I hope\nyou'll listen to their perspectives and see things\nfrom their point of view because
