[Verse]
don't put pineapple on my pizza and tell me
gotta gotta have my cheese and pepperoni
it started out with a topping how did it end up like
it was only a pizza it was only a
now I'm foaming at the mouth and she's callin' a
while he's cookin' up a storm and she's takin' a
now they're goin' to the fridge and my stomach is
and it's all in my taste

[Pre-Chorus]
but she's puttin' it in a
he takes it out now and
let me go
'cause I just can't stand it is killin' me
and takin' control

[Chorus]
jealousy turnin' pizza into a
spinnin' through toppings lullab
chokin' on your toppings lies
but It's just the flavor I
destination is callin
open up my hungry eyes
'cause I'm mr pizza

[Guitar Solo]
