your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I

your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Verse 3]\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n[Verse 4]\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n[Verse 6]\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was

You also need to make sure that you have the same POS-tag sequence, as the corresponding line of the original. Write a parody about why pineapple should not be on a pizza. Make sure to adhere to the rules of a song parody. Below you can find the original song. \nOriginal song:\n[Verse 1]\nJust stop your crying, it's a sign of the times\nWelcome to the final show\nI hope you're wearing your best clothes\nYou can't bribe the door on your way to the sky\nYou look pretty good down here\nBut you ain't really good\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe never learn, we've been here before\nWhy are we always stuck and running from\nThe bullets, the bullets?\nWe never learn, we've been here before\nWhy are we always stuck and running from\nThe bullets, the bullets?\n\n[Chorus]\nJust stop your crying, it's a sign of the times\nWe gotta get away from here\nWe gotta get away from here\nJust stop your crying, it'll be alright\nThey told me that the end is near\nWe gotta get away from here\n\n[Verse 2]\nJust stop your crying, have the time of your life\nBreaking through the atmosphere\nThings look pretty good from here\nRemember everything will be alright\nWe can meet again somewhere\nSomewhere far away from here\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe never learn, we've been here before\nWhy are we always stuck and running from\nThe bullets, the bullets?\nWe never learn, we've been here before\nWhy are we always stuck and running from\nThe bullets, the bullets?\n\n[Chorus]\nJust stop your crying, it's a sign of the times\nWe gotta get away from here\nWe gotta get away from here\nStop your crying, baby, it'll be alright\nThey told me that the end is near\nWe gotta get away from here\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe never learn, we've been here before\nWhy are we always stuck and running from\nThe bullets, the bullets?\nWe never learn, we've been here before\nWhy are we always stuck and running from\nThe bullets, the bullets?\n\n[Bridge]\nWe don't talk enough\nWe should open up\nBefore it's all too much\nWill we ever learn?\nWe've been here before\nIt's just what we know\n[Outro]\nStop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times\nWe gotta get away\nWe got to get away, we got to get away\nWe got to get away, we got to get away\nWe got to, we got to, away\nWe got to, we got to, away\nWe got to, we got to, away [/INST]\nParody:\n[Verse 1]\nput down that pineapple slice and hear my plea\nit's a culinary sin\nyour tastebuds will never win\nthe taste is just not meant to blend with cheese and dough\nit's time to face the facts and\nadmit you made a mistake\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nwe've tried this combo out before and\nwhy does it still leave us running from ough\ndisappointment raw ough\nwe've tried this combo out beforehand\nwhy does it still leave us fleeing from ow\nthe bitterness somehow\n\n[Chorus]\nput down that pineapple slice and listen to\nour rallying cry ighcries\nwe need to set things right ortiz\nput down that pineapple slice and see the\nerror of your choice ightchoices\nwe need to flee from this plesseyes\n\n[Verse 2]\nput down that pineapple slice and join the fun\nlet's savor flavors true ndertr\nmelted cheese and pepperonc\nremember we will all be better off\nwe can feast again somewhere\nsomewhere far from pine orton\n\n[Chorus]\nput down that pineapple slice and listen to\nour rallying cry ightcryiess\nwe need to set things right ounces\nput down that pineapple slice and see the ightc\nerror of your choice ightchoicesspp\nwe need to flee from this pledgessss\n\n[Bridge]\nwe don't savor much\nwe should speak up ightspe\nbefore it's all too muchs\nwill we ever learn\nwe've tried this combo\nit's just what we know\n\n[Outro]\nput down that pineapple slice and hear our plea\nwe gotta get away\nwe got to get away we got to get away\nwe got to getawayweget to getawaywe\ngot to get away we got stay\nwe got to we got to tuesday\n",
