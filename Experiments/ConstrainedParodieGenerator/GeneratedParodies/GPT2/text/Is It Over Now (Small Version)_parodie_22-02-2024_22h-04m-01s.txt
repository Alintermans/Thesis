[Verse 1]
 (I know I'm not the best par
But I know that I can make it
So I'll do what I want to
Cause I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
And I won't let you get away with it if you're not
It's not over yet but it's gonna be when I get home from
 'cause I've got to get out of here before you can get back to me
 (Oh my God I love you so much I wish I could see you again

[Chorus]
Ain't no one can see me but me and you
That's the only thing that can stop me from getting
From here to here and back and forth and
Like I said before I have to go
To the airport and get to the hospital
