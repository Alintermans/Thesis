[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
 "I was born to be
A king of the land of Israel
In the time of King Solomon I
Took the throne of Solomon

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Â I had a dream of a
King of Judah in Jerusalem
When I was young I
Went to Jerusalem to see the King
Then I went to Bethlehem
There I met a young man named
Jehovah and he told me about the
Hebrew king and how he was the son of God

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Jesus said to me that I should be the
Prince of Jerusalem and I said
That I would be a prince of all
So he gave me the keys to the Kingdom
They said they would give me a kingdom
This is what they called me
As they said it was called
Their kingdom came to an end when

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
 I heard the voice of Jesus Christ
His name was John the Baptist who
Was crucified for the sins of men
Came to preach the gospel to all nations
To all the nations that are
All of you who believe in me
You are my people and you are your kingdom
Your kingdom will come and it will bring

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
