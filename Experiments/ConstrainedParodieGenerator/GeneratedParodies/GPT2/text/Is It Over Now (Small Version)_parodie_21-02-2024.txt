[Verse 1]
 "I'll be back in a moment
 I'll tell you what I know about
 (I don't know what it is
 and I'm not sure if

[Pre-Chorus]
-I know it's not over but I can't wait to hear it
 -I've been waiting for it for a long time now and now I have
 'em and they're all waiting to see it -they're not even sure how to
 tell me what to do with them -it's too late for me to tell them how

[Chorus]
—I can see you in my dream and you can feel
.. you're in the right place at the wrong time -you
… you've got to get out of here now
–I want you to know I love you so
.. I want to be with you forever and
