Is it?)\nIs it weird that pineapple on pizza is a crime?\n\n[Verse 1]\nOnce the oven had roared (Uh-huh)\nWith the scent of cheese, I'm floored (Uh-huh)\nI bit into despair (Uh-huh)\nYou said, \"Try it, it's so rare\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred pizza debates later\nI see your profile pic with a slice, you pizza traitor\nYou dream of ham and pineapple, but it's a hater\nYou search in every pizzeria for somethin' greater, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it over when they served it on a plate?\nWas it over when you took that pineapple bait?\n\"Come here,\" I whispered in your ear\nAs you chewed on that mistake, baby\nWas it over then? And is it over now?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you lost your taste (Uh-huh)\nSweet and savory, what a waste (Uh-huh)\nPineapple on your fork (Uh-huh)\nMy taste buds screamed, \"Dork!\"\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd did you think I'd understand you?\nThere were toppings strife\nAt least I had the decency\nTo keep my crust out of the limelight\nOnly rumors 'bout my pizza pies\nAnd my cheesy highs\nOh, Lord, I think about boycotting\nEvery place that serves pineapple, darling\nJust to see you come runnin'\nAnd say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred pizza deliveries later (Oh)\nIf it's got pineapple, I will surmise, it's a pizza hater (Oh, no)\nYou dream of that fruity topping, but it's a traitor (Oh)\nYou search in every pizza box for somethin' greater, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it over when you said it's a delight?\nWas it over when you took that pineapple bite?\n\"Come here,\" I whispered in your ear\nAs you crunched on that fruit, baby\nWas it over then? And is it over now?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it?)\n[Bridge]\nThink I'd understand you?\nThere were topping fights\nAt least I had the decency\nTo keep my crust out of the limelight\nOnly rumors 'bout my pizza pies\nAnd my cheesy highs\nOh, Lord, I think about boycotting\nEvery place that serves pineapple, darling\nJust to see you come runnin' (Runnin')\nAnd say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n\n[Outro]\n(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)\nLet's fast forward to three hundred pizza deliveries later (Oh)\n(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd confess\nAnd say the one thing (Oh, Lord)\nI've been wanting (Oh, Lord)\nBut no\n(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)"
