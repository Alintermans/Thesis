Is it?)\n(Is it weird?)\n\n[Verse 1]\nOnce upon a slice (Uh-huh)\nPineapple paradise (Uh-huh)\nA taste bud sacrifice (Uh-huh)\nYou said, \"Pizza, be nice\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred doughy confrontations\nI see your plate, and it's a fruity abomination\nYou dream of ham and cheese in sweet, sweet collaboration\nBut I'm stuck on this island of pineapple fixation, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it weird when it landed on your dough?\nWas it strange when the cheese refused to flow?\n\"Come here,\" I whispered, \"Let's make a deal\nIn this pizza garden surreal, baby\nWas it weird then? And is it weird now?\"\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you lost your taste (Uh-huh)\nRed sauce, pineapple embrace (Uh-huh)\nHawaiian dreams replaced (Uh-huh)\nYour new choice, a tasteless chase\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd did you think I'd let it slide, hun?\nPineapple chunks under the sun\nOnly rumors 'bout my fruity fun\nAnd my whispered puns\nOh, Lord, I think about diving\nInto a sea of toppings thriving\nJust to see you come running\nAnd say, \"Pineapple on pizza, I'm done!\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred pizza debates later (Oh)\nIf it's got pineapple, you'll probably scoff and cater (Oh, no)\nYou dream of pepperoni, but your taste buds are traitors (Oh)\nYou search in every pizza box for something greater, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it weird when it danced upon your crust?\nWas it odd when the pineapple trust?\n\"Come here,\" I whispered, \"Let's make a vow\nIn this pineapple pizza circus, baby\nIs it weird now? And was it weird then?\"\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it?)\n[Bridge]\nDid you think I'd let it slide, hun?\nOnly rumors 'bout my fruity fun\nOh, Lord, I think about diving\nInto a sea of toppings thriving\nJust to see you come running (Running)\nAnd say, \"Pineapple on pizza, I'm done!\"\n\n[Outro]\n(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)\nLet's fast forward to three hundred taste tests later (Oh)\n(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd declare\nAnd say, \"Pineapple pizza, it's rare!\"\nBut no\n(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)"
