Is it?)\n\n[Verse 1]\nOnce the pizza was gone\nWith the pineapple's pong\nI cringed and I groaned\nYou still wouldn't condone\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizzas later\nI see your face and your smile on my pizza platter\nYou dream of pepperoni before it's drowned in the pineapple's mire\nYou pine for every pizza's crust without that fruit's dire\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it over when you ordered a pineapple pizza?\nWas it over when I told you it was a pizza travesty?\n\"Don't you dare,\" I pleaded in your ear,\nAs you reached for that pineapple slice, \"It's not a pizza, oh, dear!\"\nWas it over then? And is it over now?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you lost your taste buds\nTo the pineapple's abuse\nRed sauce, green cheese\nYour pizza's a tease\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd did you think I didn't see\nThe pineapple's green core?\nAt least I had the sense\nTo keep my pizzas from that fruit's poor excuse\nOnly whispers of my pepperoni and my veggie delight\nNo pineapple's pungent, sour bite\nOh, Lord, I think about switching\nTo a pizza without that fruit's clinging\nJust to see you come runnin'\nAnd say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred pineapple-free pizzas later (Oh)\nIf it's got no pineapple, I will surmise that you'll be back, mate (Oh, no)\nI dream of my pizza's taste before it's ruined by pineapple's state (Oh)\nI'll search for every pizza without that fruit's nasty fate, mate\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it over when you ordered that pineapple pizza?\nWas it over when I told you it was a pizza catastrophe?\n\"Don't you dare,\" I pleaded in your ear,\nAs you reached for that pineapple slice, \"It's not a pizza, oh, dear!\"\nWas it over then? And is it over now?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Bridge]\nThink I didn't see you?\nThe pineapple's green hue\nAt least I had the decency\nTo keep my pizzas from that fruit's foul brew\nOnly whispers of my pepperoni and my veggie delight\nNo pineapple's pungent, sour bite\nOh, Lord, I think about switching\nTo a pizza without that fruit's clinging\nJust to see you come runnin'\nAnd say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n\n[Outro]\n(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)\nLet's fast forward to three hundred pineapple-free pizzas later (Oh)\n(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there\nAnd say the one thing (Oh, Lord)\nI've been wanting (Oh, Lord)\nBut no\n(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)"
