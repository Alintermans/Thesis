Is it?)\n\n[Verse 1]\nOnce the pizza was served (Uh-huh)\nWith the pineapple absurd (Uh-huh)\nI couldn't eat a bite (Uh-huh)\nIt was a culinary crime\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred pizza orders later\nI see the pineapple's grin on the pizza boxes' paper\nYou dream of a pizza without the fruit, a sweet and savory delight\nYou search in every pizza place for a taste that's pure and bright\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it over when the pineapple landed on the pie?\nWas it over when the garlic and pineapple did collide?\n\"Take it away,\" I whispered in the chef's ear\nIn my dream as I threw up, baby\nWas it over then? And is it over now?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen the toppings lost control (Uh-huh)\nRed sauce, green olives (Uh-huh)\nThin crust, deep-dish (Uh-huh)\nYour pizza is a mess\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd did you think I didn't see you?\nThere were strange toppings and a weird cheese\nAt least I had the decency\nTo not order a pineapple with my cheesy feast\nOnly rumors 'bout my pizza preferences\nAnd my whispered pleas for sanity\nOh, Lord, I think about ordering\nA pizza just for me\nTo see you regret your pineapple decision, but no\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred pizza parties later (Oh)\nIf there's pineapple on the menu, I'll be the one to say no (Oh, no)\nYou dream of a pizza without the fruit, a sweet and savory delight\nYou search in every pizza place for a taste that's pure and bright\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it over when the pineapple landed on the pie?\nWas it over when the garlic and pineapple did collide?\n\"Take it away,\" I whispered in the chef's ear\nIn my dream as I threw up, baby\nWas it over then? And is it over now?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Bridge]\nThink I didn't see you?\nThere were strange toppings and a weird cheese\nAt least I had the decency\nTo not order a pineapple with my cheesy feast\nOnly rumors 'bout my pizza preferences\nAnd my whispered pleas for sanity\nOh, Lord, I think about ordering\nA pineapple-free pizza\nTo see you regret your pineapple decision, but no\n\n[Outro]\n(Strange toppings, Oh, Lord, Oh)\nLet's fast forward to three hundred pizza parties later (Oh)\n(Strange toppings) I was hoping you'd be there\nAnd say the one thing (Oh, Lord)\nI've been wanting (Oh, Lord)\nBut no\n(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)"
