    "parodie": "[INTRO]\n(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Verse 1]\nOnce I ordered a pizza (Uh-huh)\nWith extra cheese and pepperoni (Uh-huh)\nBut then you added pineapple (Uh-huh)\nI slept alone, feeling quite forlorn\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred awkward meals later (Oh)\nIf it's got pineapple, I will conjecture that you'll probably hate it (Oh, no)\nYou dream of my pizza before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)\nYou search in every restaurant's menu for somethin' greater, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it over when you ruined my pizza?\nWas it over when you added that nasty fruit?\n\"Come here,\" I whispered in your ear\nIn your dream as you passed out, baby\nWas it over then? And is it over now?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you ruined my pizza (Uh-huh)\nGreen fruit, red sauce (Uh-huh)\nBlue cheese on a crust (Uh-huh)\nYour new pizza is my nightmare\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd did you think I didn't see you?\nThere were flashin' lights\nAt least I had the decency\nTo keep my meals out of sight\nOnly rumors 'bout my appetite\nAnd my whispered sighs\nOh, Lord, I think about jumpin'\nOff of very tall somethings\nJust to see you come runnin'\nAnd say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)\nIf she's got pineapple, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)\nYou dream of my pizza before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)\nYou search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it over when you ruined my pizza?\nWas it over when you added that nasty fruit?\n\"Come here,\" I whispered in your ear\nIn your dream as you passed out, baby\nWas it over then? And is it over now?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Bridge]\nThink I didn't see you?\nThere were flashin' lights\nAt least I had the decency\nTo keep my meals out of sight\nOnly rumors 'bout my appetite\nAnd my whispered sighs\nOh, Lord, I think about jumpin'\nOff of very tall somethings\nJust to see you come runnin'\n(Runnin')\nAnd say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n\n[Outro]\n(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)\nLet's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)\n(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there\nAnd say the one thing (Oh, Lord)"
