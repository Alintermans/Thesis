[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)
(Is it weird?)

[Verse 1]
Once upon a slice (Uh-huh)
Pineapple paradise (Uh-huh)
A taste bud sacrifice (Uh-huh)
You said, "Pizza, be nice"

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred doughy confrontations
I see your plate, and it's a fruity abomination
You dream of ham and cheese in sweet, sweet collaboration
But I'm stuck on this island of pineapple fixation, baby

[Chorus]
Was it weird when it landed on your dough?
Was it strange when the cheese refused to flow?
"Come here," I whispered, "Let's make a deal
In this pizza garden surreal, baby
Was it weird then? And is it weird now?"

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you lost your taste (Uh-huh)
Red sauce, pineapple embrace (Uh-huh)
Hawaiian dreams replaced (Uh-huh)
Your new choice, a tasteless chase

[Bridge]
And did you think I'd let it slide, hun?
Pineapple chunks under the sun
Only rumors 'bout my fruity fun
And my whispered puns
Oh, Lord, I think about diving
Into a sea of toppings thriving
Just to see you come running
And say, "Pineapple on pizza, I'm done!"

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza debates later (Oh)
If it's got pineapple, you'll probably scoff and cater (Oh, no)
You dream of pepperoni, but your taste buds are traitors (Oh)
You search in every pizza box for something greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it weird when it danced upon your crust?
Was it odd when the pineapple trust?
"Come here," I whispered, "Let's make a vow
In this pineapple pizza circus, baby
Is it weird now? And was it weird then?"

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Did you think I'd let it slide, hun?
Only rumors 'bout my fruity fun
Oh, Lord, I think about diving
Into a sea of toppings thriving
Just to see you come running (Running)
And say, "Pineapple on pizza, I'm done!"

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred taste tests later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd declare
And say, "Pineapple pizza, it's rare!"
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
