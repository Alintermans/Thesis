[INTRO]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once I ordered a pizza (Uh-huh)
With extra cheese and pepperoni (Uh-huh)
But then you added pineapple (Uh-huh)
I slept alone, feeling quite forlorn

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward meals later (Oh)
If it's got pineapple, I will conjecture that you'll probably hate it (Oh, no)
You dream of my pizza before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every restaurant's menu for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when you ruined my pizza?
Was it over when you added that nasty fruit?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you ruined my pizza (Uh-huh)
Green fruit, red sauce (Uh-huh)
Blue cheese on a crust (Uh-huh)
Your new pizza is my nightmare

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my meals out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my appetite
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got pineapple, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my pizza before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when you ruined my pizza?
Was it over when you added that nasty fruit?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my meals out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my appetite
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
(Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
