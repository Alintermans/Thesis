[INTRO]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the pineapple was on the pizza (Uh-huh)
With the cheese and the sauce, it didn't belong (Uh-huh)
I ordered a pie, all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go, now it's a song

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout disasters later (Oh)
If it's got pineapple, I will surmise that you'll probably hate it (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a crazy traitor (Oh)
You search in every pizzeria's menu for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when you put pineapple on my pizza?
Was it over when you ruined my meal with your weird fetish?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you lost control (Uh-huh)
And put ham and pineapple on my pie (Uh-huh)
Red sauce, white cheese (Uh-huh)
Your new pizza is my worst nightmare

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my pizza orders out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my disgust and fright
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward pizza dates later (Oh)
If it's got pineapple, I will surmise that you'll probably hate it (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every pizzeria's menu for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when you put pineapple on my pizza?
Was it over when you ruined my meal with your weird fetish?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout disasters later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
