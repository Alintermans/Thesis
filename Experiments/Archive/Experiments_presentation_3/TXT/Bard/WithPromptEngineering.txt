[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the pizza was gone
With the pineapple's pong
I cringed and I groaned
You still wouldn't condone

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizzas later
I see your face and your smile on my pizza platter
You dream of pepperoni before it's drowned in the pineapple's mire
You pine for every pizza's crust without that fruit's dire

[Chorus]
Was it over when you ordered a pineapple pizza?
Was it over when I told you it was a pizza travesty?
"Don't you dare," I pleaded in your ear,
As you reached for that pineapple slice, "It's not a pizza, oh, dear!"
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you lost your taste buds
To the pineapple's abuse
Red sauce, green cheese
Your pizza's a tease

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see
The pineapple's green core?
At least I had the sense
To keep my pizzas from that fruit's poor excuse
Only whispers of my pepperoni and my veggie delight
No pineapple's pungent, sour bite
Oh, Lord, I think about switching
To a pizza without that fruit's clinging
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pineapple-free pizzas later (Oh)
If it's got no pineapple, I will surmise that you'll be back, mate (Oh, no)
I dream of my pizza's taste before it's ruined by pineapple's state (Oh)
I'll search for every pizza without that fruit's nasty fate, mate

[Chorus]
Was it over when you ordered that pineapple pizza?
Was it over when I told you it was a pizza catastrophe?
"Don't you dare," I pleaded in your ear,
As you reached for that pineapple slice, "It's not a pizza, oh, dear!"
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
The pineapple's green hue
At least I had the decency
To keep my pizzas from that fruit's foul brew
Only whispers of my pepperoni and my veggie delight
No pineapple's pungent, sour bite
Oh, Lord, I think about switching
To a pizza without that fruit's clinging
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred pineapple-free pizzas later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
