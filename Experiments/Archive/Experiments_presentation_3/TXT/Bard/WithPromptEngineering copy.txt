ORIGINAL:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)

PARODIE:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the pizza box opened (Uh-huh)
With the smell of pineapple aroma (Uh-huh)
I gagged all alone (Uh-huh)
My taste buds wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred plates of pizza later
I see pineapple cubes on every table, oh, waiter
You dream of my pepperoni before it called you a culinary traitor
You search for flavor in every slice, but you're just a pineapple hater, baby

[Chorus]
Is it over when the pineapple hit my tongue?
Is it over when the pizza looked so wrong?
"Take this pizza away," I whispered in the air
In my dream, I woke up in despair, baby
Is it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you lost your mind (Uh-huh)
Pineapple in every kind (Uh-huh)
Hawaiian pizza, a crime (Uh-huh)
Your new taste buds are mine

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
With that pineapple pizza, me too
At least I had the decency
To keep my pizza preferences true
Only rumors 'bout my love for pepperoni
And my whispered wishes for a pizza free of pineapple, oh
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
Pepperoni pizza, nothing else ordering
Just to see you cringe and say
"Oh, no," but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward pizza parties later (Oh)
If there's pineapple on the menu, I will surely make a fuss (Oh, no)
You dream of my simple taste before it called you a pineapple abuser (Oh)
You search for flavor in every slice, but your taste buds are confused, baby

[Chorus]
Is it over when the pineapple hit my tongue?
Is it over when the pizza looked so wrong?
"Take this pizza away," I whispered in the air
In my dream, I woke up in despair, baby
Is it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
With that pineapple pizza, me too
At least I had the decency
To keep my pizza preferences true
Only rumors 'bout my love for pepperoni
And my whispered wishes for a pizza free of pineapple, oh
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
Pepperoni pizza, nothing else ordering
Just to see you cringe and say
"Oh, no," but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizza menus later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
