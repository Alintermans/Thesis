ORIGINAL:
[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you pass–µd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

PARODIE:
[Verse 1]
When the plane took off (Oh-oh
It was a beautiful day in
The sky was blue and the clouds
And the sun was out

[Pre-Chorus]
But I couldn't see the stars in the sky (oh-ooh oh oh
Oh yeah baby I'm so glad you're here baby oh yeah I love
Your smile is so sweet oh baby yeah yeah you love me baby
Yeah baby you know I know you don't have to tell me that (yeah

[Chorus]
oh yeah oh yes baby i love you baby
Baby yeah i'm sorry baby no I don
Don't want to hear it baby don
That's okay baby it's ok baby
We're going to be together forever
