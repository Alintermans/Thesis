ORIGINAL:
[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
PARODIE:
[Verse 1]
 The flight was on the way to
 I'm gonna be the one to make
 It's a cold night in the woods
 You still won't come

[Pre-Chorus]
 Let's go to the park and play with the kids and then we'll
 We're going to be in a park with a bunch of kids playing
 That's what you do when you don't know what to do with yourself
 If you're not in love with your own body then you'll never find love

[Chorus]
 Was it when I laid on her couch and you were
 When I lay on your couch I'm not sure if you
 Come to me and I'll make you love me
 In your dreams you can't see me but
 Did it ever end when we were together

[Post-Chorus]
 What's your name again

[Verse 2]
 Why did you lose control of
 Red blood and white blood (Oh
 Blue dress with red hair and blue
 She's my new clone and her

[Bridge]
 And I thought you weren't looking at
 There were flashing lights
 At least you didn't have to die
 To keep your nights from being
 Only rumors about my thighs and
 Oh my god I can
 How do you think I feel about
 Off of tall things that are tall
 Just to watch you go running
 But I know that you know it's not true but I

[Pre-Chorus]
 This is what I do for a living (I do it because I
 So you want to know why I made you blue and red and green and yellow and
 My name is Parody Genrator and this is my parody
 A parody is a parody of a song or a movie

[Chorus]
 Is it true that I lost control and fell down
 No it wasn't over but it was over
 Don't worry about me I won
 Now you are my parody and my
 Yes it is over and it will never end

[Post-Chorus]
 Yeah I
 Are you sure you wanna
 Uh-uh
 Well I guess it

[Bridge]
 Think I don´t know who I
 They're all flashing and
 All I want is to see you cry
 For you to keep me from seeing
 Whoa whoa what are you talking about
 Pineaple should be off
 Ooh yeah I love you so much I
 On the roof of my head and
 Hey I wanna see your face (Come run
 Parody is an art form that uses a

[Outro]
 He's got a blue dress and
 Can you believe that it took me so long to write this song
 Wanna see my face when it gets dark (
 Do you like me (Oooh I like
 Be my parody and
 Then I
 Were you there when he fell to his knees and cried and
