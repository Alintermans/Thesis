ORIGINAL:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)

PARODIE:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the pizza was flown (Uh-huh)
With pineapple thrown (Uh-huh)
I ate all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't condone

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza debates later
I see your scowl and your frown at pineapple-hating haters
You dream of cheese, but then you see the fruit that's a traitor
You search in every pizza box for flavor greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it bizarre when they laid pineapple on the dough?
Was it weird when I said, "Let's give it a go?"
"Try here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you freaked out, baby
Was it peculiar then? And is it strange now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you lost your cool (Uh-huh)
Fruit and cheese, no rule (Uh-huh)
Your old taste, my new tool (Uh-huh)
This pizza's not for the old school

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were faces grim
At least I had the bravery
To try what's on a whim
Only rumors 'bout this sweet and savory
And my daring tries
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
Extra pineapple toppings
Just to see you come running
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later (Oh)
If it's got ham slices, I surmise that it's a flavor creator (Oh, no)
You dream of cheese only, before it met with the pineapple invader (Oh)
You search in every topping pile for something greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it bizarre when they laid pineapple on the dough?
Was it weird when I said, "Let's give it a go?"
"Try here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you freaked out, baby
Was it peculiar then? And is it strange now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were faces grim
At least I had the bravery
To try what's on a whim
Only rumors 'bout this sweet and savory
And my daring tries
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
Extra pineapple toppings
Just to see you come running (Running)
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Faces grim; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later (Oh)
(Faces grim) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
