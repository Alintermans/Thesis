ORIGINAL:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)

PARODIE:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the pizza dough's thrown (Uh-huh)
With the heat of the stove (Uh-huh)
I can't eat all alone (Uh-huh)
This topping's a no-go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward through a hundred pizza debates later
I see your toppings and your choice on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of pineapple before I called it a flavor traitor
You search on every pizza slice for something greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when pineapple laid down on the dough?
Was it over when the cheese and ham began to flow?
"Try here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you chewed slow, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you lost pizza control (Uh-huh)
Yellow fruit, cheese so bold (Uh-huh)
Pineapple on a roll (Uh-huh)
Your taste buds, I can't condone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see it?
There were flavors bright
At least I had the decency
To keep my toppings out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my cheese and spice
And my pizza slice
Oh, Lord, I think about leaving
This very odd pairing
Just to see you come running
And say it's a taste worth flaunting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to a hundred pizza parties later (Oh)
If it's topped with fruit, I will dispute that it's a flavor maker (Oh, no)
You dream of pineapple before it made me a pizza hater (Oh)
You search in every pizzeria bed for something greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when pineapple laid down on the dough?
Was it over when the cheese and ham began to flow?
"Try here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you chewed slow, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Bridge]
Think I didn't see it?
There were flavors bright
At least I had the decency
To keep my toppings out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my cheese and spice
And my pizza slice
Oh, Lord, I think about leaving
This very odd pairing
Just to see you come running (Running)
And say it's a taste worth flaunting, but no

[Outro]
(Flavors bright; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward through a hundred pizza debates later (Oh)
(Flavors bright) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
