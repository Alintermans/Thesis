ORIGINAL:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)

PARODIE:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the pizza was served (Uh-huh)
With the pineapple absurd (Uh-huh)
I couldn't eat a bite (Uh-huh)
It was a culinary crime

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza orders later
I see the pineapple's grin on the pizza boxes' paper
You dream of a pizza without the fruit, a sweet and savory delight
You search in every pizza place for a taste that's pure and bright

[Chorus]
Was it over when the pineapple landed on the pie?
Was it over when the garlic and pineapple did collide?
"Take it away," I whispered in the chef's ear
In my dream as I threw up, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When the toppings lost control (Uh-huh)
Red sauce, green olives (Uh-huh)
Thin crust, deep-dish (Uh-huh)
Your pizza is a mess

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were strange toppings and a weird cheese
At least I had the decency
To not order a pineapple with my cheesy feast
Only rumors 'bout my pizza preferences
And my whispered pleas for sanity
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
A pizza just for me
To see you regret your pineapple decision, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza parties later (Oh)
If there's pineapple on the menu, I'll be the one to say no (Oh, no)
You dream of a pizza without the fruit, a sweet and savory delight
You search in every pizza place for a taste that's pure and bright

[Chorus]
Was it over when the pineapple landed on the pie?
Was it over when the garlic and pineapple did collide?
"Take it away," I whispered in the chef's ear
In my dream as I threw up, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were strange toppings and a weird cheese
At least I had the decency
To not order a pineapple with my cheesy feast
Only rumors 'bout my pizza preferences
And my whispered pleas for sanity
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
A pineapple-free pizza
To see you regret your pineapple decision, but no

[Outro]
(Strange toppings, Oh, Lord, Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza parties later (Oh)
(Strange toppings) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)
