[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)

PARODIE:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the pizza was gone
With the pineapple's pong
I cringed and I groaned
You still wouldn't condone

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout pizzas later
I see your face and your smile on my pizza platter
You dream of pepperoni before it's drowned in the pineapple's mire
You pine for every pizza's crust without that fruit's dire

[Chorus]
Was it over when you ordered a pineapple pizza?
Was it over when I told you it was a pizza travesty?
"Don't you dare," I pleaded in your ear,
As you reached for that pineapple slice, "It's not a pizza, oh, dear!"
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you lost your taste buds
To the pineapple's abuse
Red sauce, green cheese
Your pizza's a tease

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see
The pineapple's green core?
At least I had the sense
To keep my pizzas from that fruit's poor excuse
Only whispers of my pepperoni and my veggie delight
No pineapple's pungent, sour bite
Oh, Lord, I think about switching
To a pizza without that fruit's clinging
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pineapple-free pizzas later (Oh)
If it's got no pineapple, I will surmise that you'll be back, mate (Oh, no)
I dream of my pizza's taste before it's ruined by pineapple's state (Oh)
I'll search for every pizza without that fruit's nasty fate, mate

[Chorus]
Was it over when you ordered that pineapple pizza?
Was it over when I told you it was a pizza catastrophe?
"Don't you dare," I pleaded in your ear,
As you reached for that pineapple slice, "It's not a pizza, oh, dear!"
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
The pineapple's green hue
At least I had the decency
To keep my pizzas from that fruit's foul brew
Only whispers of my pepperoni and my veggie delight
No pineapple's pungent, sour bite
Oh, Lord, I think about switching
To a pizza without that fruit's clinging
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred pineapple-free pizzas later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
