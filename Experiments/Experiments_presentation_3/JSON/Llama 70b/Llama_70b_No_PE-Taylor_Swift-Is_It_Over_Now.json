    "parodie": "[INTRO]\n(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Verse 1]\nOnce the pineapple was on the pizza (Uh-huh)\nWith the cheese and the sauce, it didn't belong (Uh-huh)\nI ordered a pie, all alone (Uh-huh)\nYou still wouldn't go, now it's a song\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred takeout disasters later (Oh)\nIf it's got pineapple, I will surmise that you'll probably hate it (Oh, no)\nYou dream of my mouth before it called you a crazy traitor (Oh)\nYou search in every pizzeria's menu for somethin' greater, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it over when you put pineapple on my pizza?\nWas it over when you ruined my meal with your weird fetish?\n\"Come here,\" I whispered in your ear\nIn your dream as you passed out, baby\nWas it over then? And is it over now?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you lost control (Uh-huh)\nAnd put ham and pineapple on my pie (Uh-huh)\nRed sauce, white cheese (Uh-huh)\nYour new pizza is my worst nightmare\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd did you think I didn't see you?\nThere were flashin' lights\nAt least I had the decency\nTo keep my pizza orders out of sight\nOnly rumors 'bout my disgust and fright\nAnd my whispered sighs\nOh, Lord, I think about jumpin'\nOff of very tall somethings\nJust to see you come runnin'\nAnd say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's fast forward to three hundred awkward pizza dates later (Oh)\nIf it's got pineapple, I will surmise that you'll probably hate it (Oh, no)\nYou dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)\nYou search in every pizzeria's menu for somethin' greater, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nWas it over when you put pineapple on my pizza?\nWas it over when you ruined my meal with your weird fetish?\n\"Come here,\" I whispered in your ear\nIn your dream as you passed out, baby\nWas it over then? And is it over now?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\nUh-huh\n(Is it? Is it?)\n\n[Outro]\n(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)\nLet's fast forward to three hundred takeout disasters later (Oh)\n(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there\nAnd say the one thing (Oh, Lord)\nI've been wanting (Oh, Lord)\nBut no\n(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)"
