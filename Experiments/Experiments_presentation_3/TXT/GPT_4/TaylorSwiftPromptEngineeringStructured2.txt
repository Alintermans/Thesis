ORIGINAL:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)

PARODIE:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the pizza dough's thrown (Uh-huh)
With pineapple home (Uh-huh)
I thought all alone (Uh-huh)
This combo's unknown

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza slices later
I see your surprise and your eyes on this fruity invader
You dream of plain cheese before this tropical betrayer
You search in every topping's blend for flavor savior, baby

[Chorus]
Was it crazy when pineapple laid upon your slice?
Was it madness when ham joined in, oh, isn't it nice?
"Come try," I whispered with a grin
In your dream as you munched out, baby
Was it crazy then? And is it crazy now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you took your first bite (Uh-huh)
Sweet and savory fight (Uh-huh)
Cheese stretch, oh so right (Uh-huh)
Your new fave, in plain sight

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashing lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my toppings out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my fruity bites
And my pineapple nights
Oh, Lord, I think about serving
Up very odd somethings
Just to see you come running
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred cheesy debates later (Oh)
If it's got that fruit, I guess it's fate that you'll probably hate her (Oh, no)
You dream of plain crust before it met this flavor traitor (Oh)
You search in every pizzeria for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it crazy when pineapple laid upon your slice?
Was it madness when ham joined in, oh, isn't it nice?
"Come try," I whispered with a grin
In your dream as you munched out, baby
Was it crazy then? And is it crazy now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashing lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my toppings out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my fruity bites
And my pineapple nights
Oh, Lord, I think about serving
Up very odd somethings
Just to see you come running (Running)
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashing lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred cheesy slices later (Oh)
(Flashing lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
