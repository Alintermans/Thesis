ORIGINAL:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)

PARODIE:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)
(Oh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Once a pizza pie, oh (Uh-huh)
With the cheese all aglow (Uh-huh)
I tried a bite, oh (Uh-huh)
Pineapple, you know (Uh-huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza debates later
I see your face and your taste, it's a pizza hater
You dream of that fruit, on your pizza, you're an instigator
You search for that fruity kick, but it's just a spectator, baby

[Chorus]
Was it wrong when I put pineapple on my slice?
Was it wrong when you said, "That's not very nice"?
"Try it," I said with pizza pride
In my Hawaiian paradise, baby
Was it wrong then? And is it wrong now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you took a bite (Uh-huh)
Said, "It's just not right" (Uh-huh)
You looked quite uptight (Uh-huh)
But I enjoyed every bite (Uh-huh)

[Bridge]
And did you think I wouldn't notice?
That disapproving stare
At least I had the bravery
To put pineapple everywhere
Only whispers 'bout my toppings choice
And my taste bud voice
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
A pie with extra pineapple rings
Just to hear you start bickering
But no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza nights later (Oh)
If it's got pineapple, I will savor, no need to cater (Oh, no)
You dream of a classic slice, but you're just a pizza traitor (Oh)
You search for a plain pie, but you'll find nothin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it wrong when I put pineapple on my slice?
Was it wrong when you said, "That's not very nice"?
"Try it," I said with pizza pride
In my Hawaiian paradise, baby
Was it wrong then? And is it wrong now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Bridge]
Did you think I wouldn't notice?
That pineapple's delight
At least I had the bravery
To add that sweet, tangy bite
Only whispers 'bout my toppings choice
And my taste bud voice
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
A pie with extra pineapple rings
Just to hear you start bickering
But no
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)

[Outro]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza debates later (Oh)
I was hoping you'd try it
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been craving (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
