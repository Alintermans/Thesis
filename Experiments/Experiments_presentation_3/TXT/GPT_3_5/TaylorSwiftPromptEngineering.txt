[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Is it weird that pineapple on pizza is a crime?

[Verse 1]
Once the oven had roared (Uh-huh)
With the scent of cheese, I'm floored (Uh-huh)
I bit into despair (Uh-huh)
You said, "Try it, it's so rare"

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza debates later
I see your profile pic with a slice, you pizza traitor
You dream of ham and pineapple, but it's a hater
You search in every pizzeria for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when they served it on a plate?
Was it over when you took that pineapple bait?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
As you chewed on that mistake, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you lost your taste (Uh-huh)
Sweet and savory, what a waste (Uh-huh)
Pineapple on your fork (Uh-huh)
My taste buds screamed, "Dork!"

[Bridge]
And did you think I'd understand you?
There were toppings strife
At least I had the decency
To keep my crust out of the limelight
Only rumors 'bout my pizza pies
And my cheesy highs
Oh, Lord, I think about boycotting
Every place that serves pineapple, darling
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza deliveries later (Oh)
If it's got pineapple, I will surmise, it's a pizza hater (Oh, no)
You dream of that fruity topping, but it's a traitor (Oh)
You search in every pizza box for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when you said it's a delight?
Was it over when you took that pineapple bite?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
As you crunched on that fruit, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I'd understand you?
There were topping fights
At least I had the decency
To keep my crust out of the limelight
Only rumors 'bout my pizza pies
And my cheesy highs
Oh, Lord, I think about boycotting
Every place that serves pineapple, darling
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza deliveries later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd confess
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
