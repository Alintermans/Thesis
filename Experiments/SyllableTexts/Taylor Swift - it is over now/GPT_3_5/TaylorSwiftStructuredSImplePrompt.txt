ORIGINAL:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)

PARODIE:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Pineapple on a pizza (Uh-huh)
Caused a real pizza feud (Uh-huh)
I took a big bite (Uh-huh)
Now I'm misconstrued

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza parlor debates later
I see you with your pineapple, you pizza rule breaker
You dream of sweet and savory, but I say, "See you later"
You search for pizza toppings that'll make my taste buds greater, baby

[Chorus]
Is it crazy when it's on my slice?
Is it madness, a culinary heist?
"Oh no," I cried as I took a bite
In pizza dreams, it seemed so right, baby
Is it over yet? Or just flavor paradise?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you reached for that can (Uh-huh)
And the fruit hit the cheese (Uh-huh)
I said, "Hey, man" (Uh-huh)
"Are you trying to tease?"

[Bridge]
And did you think I wouldn't notice?
That fruity, cheesy blend
At least I had the decency
To try and comprehend
Only rumors 'bout that pineapple slice
And my pizza vice
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
A pizza with everything
Just to make your taste buds sing
And say, "Pineapple's the king," but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza toppings later (Oh)
If it's pineapple again, I'll be the pizza dictator (Oh, no)
You dream of that sweetness, but I'm a pizza curator (Oh)
You search for the perfect combo, but I say, "See you later," baby

[Chorus]
Is it crazy when it's on my slice?
Is it madness, a culinary heist?
"Oh no," I cried as I took a bite
In pizza dreams, it seemed so right, baby
Is it over yet? Or just flavor paradise?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Bridge]
Think I wouldn't notice?
That fruity, cheesy blend
At least I had the decency
To try and comprehend
Only rumors 'bout that pineapple slice
And my pizza vice
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
A pizza with everything
Just to make your taste buds sing
And say, "Pineapple's the king," but no

[Outro]
(On my pizza; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza parlor debates later (Oh)
(On my pizza) I was hoping you'd see the light
And say that pineapple (Oh, Lord)
Is the topping that's just right
But no
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)
