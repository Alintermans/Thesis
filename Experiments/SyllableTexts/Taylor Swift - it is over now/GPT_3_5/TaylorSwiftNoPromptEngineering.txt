ORIGINAL:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)

PARODIE:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)
(Is it weird?)

[Verse 1]
Once upon a slice (Uh-huh)
Pineapple paradise (Uh-huh)
A taste bud sacrifice (Uh-huh)
You said, "Pizza, be nice"

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred doughy confrontations
I see your plate, and it's a fruity abomination
You dream of ham and cheese in sweet, sweet collaboration
But I'm stuck on this island of pineapple fixation, baby

[Chorus]
Was it weird when it landed on your dough?
Was it strange when the cheese refused to flow?
"Come here," I whispered, "Let's make a deal
In this pizza garden surreal, baby
Was it weird then? And is it weird now?"

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you lost your taste (Uh-huh)
Red sauce, pineapple embrace (Uh-huh)
Hawaiian dreams replaced (Uh-huh)
Your new choice, a tasteless chase

[Bridge]
And did you think I'd let it slide, hun?
Pineapple chunks under the sun
Only rumors 'bout my fruity fun
And my whispered puns
Oh, Lord, I think about diving
Into a sea of toppings thriving
Just to see you come running
And say, "Pineapple on pizza, I'm done!"

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza debates later (Oh)
If it's got pineapple, you'll probably scoff and cater (Oh, no)
You dream of pepperoni, but your taste buds are traitors (Oh)
You search in every pizza box for something greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it weird when it danced upon your crust?
Was it odd when the pineapple trust?
"Come here," I whispered, "Let's make a vow
In this pineapple pizza circus, baby
Is it weird now? And was it weird then?"

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Did you think I'd let it slide, hun?
Only rumors 'bout my fruity fun
Oh, Lord, I think about diving
Into a sea of toppings thriving
Just to see you come running (Running)
And say, "Pineapple on pizza, I'm done!"

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred taste tests later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd declare
And say, "Pineapple pizza, it's rare!"
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
