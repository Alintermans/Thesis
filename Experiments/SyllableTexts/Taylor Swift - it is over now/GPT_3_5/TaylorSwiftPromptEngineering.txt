ORIGINAL:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)

PARODIE:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Is it weird that pineapple on pizza is a crime?

[Verse 1]
Once the oven had roared (Uh-huh)
With the scent of cheese, I'm floored (Uh-huh)
I bit into despair (Uh-huh)
You said, "Try it, it's so rare"

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza debates later
I see your profile pic with a slice, you pizza traitor
You dream of ham and pineapple, but it's a hater
You search in every pizzeria for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when they served it on a plate?
Was it over when you took that pineapple bait?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
As you chewed on that mistake, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you lost your taste (Uh-huh)
Sweet and savory, what a waste (Uh-huh)
Pineapple on your fork (Uh-huh)
My taste buds screamed, "Dork!"

[Bridge]
And did you think I'd understand you?
There were toppings strife
At least I had the decency
To keep my crust out of the limelight
Only rumors 'bout my pizza pies
And my cheesy highs
Oh, Lord, I think about boycotting
Every place that serves pineapple, darling
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza deliveries later (Oh)
If it's got pineapple, I will surmise, it's a pizza hater (Oh, no)
You dream of that fruity topping, but it's a traitor (Oh)
You search in every pizza box for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when you said it's a delight?
Was it over when you took that pineapple bite?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
As you crunched on that fruit, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I'd understand you?
There were topping fights
At least I had the decency
To keep my crust out of the limelight
Only rumors 'bout my pizza pies
And my cheesy highs
Oh, Lord, I think about boycotting
Every place that serves pineapple, darling
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza deliveries later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd confess
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
