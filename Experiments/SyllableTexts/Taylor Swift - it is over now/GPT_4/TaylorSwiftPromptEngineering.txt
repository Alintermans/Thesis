[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)

PARODIE:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Weird or is it? Tasty? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the pizza came (Uh-huh)
With pineapple's shame (Uh-huh)
I gazed in disdain (Uh-huh)
You still craved its taste

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza debates later
I see your odd topping choice and sigh at pizzeria waiters
You dream of sweet fruit where cheese and sauce cater
You search in every pizza slice for flavor greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it bizarre when pineapple lay on the dough?
Was it strange when you said, "Trust me, let's go"?
"Try here," you whispered, near my fear
In my doubt as I hesitated, baby
Was it weird then? And is it peculiar now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Edible?)

[Verse 2]
When you lost your sense (Uh-huh)
Fruit and cheese, intense (Uh-huh)
My taste buds on defense (Uh-huh)
Your choice makes no pretense

[Bridge]
And did you think I wouldn't notice?
There were tangy bites
At least I had the decency
To keep my doubts out of sight
Only whispers 'bout this topping fight
And my puzzled plight
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
Just plain ol' pepperoni
Just to see you arguing
And say the one thing I've been pondering, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred weird topping trials later (Oh)
If it's got fruit on, I will presume that you'll probably savor (Oh, no)
You dream of my taste before it named you a flavor traitor (Oh)
You search in every quirky dish for something greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it bizarre when pineapple lay on the dough?
Was it strange when you said, "Trust me, let's go"?
"Try here," you whispered, near my fear
In my doubt as I hesitated, baby
Was it weird then? And is it peculiar now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Edible?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Bridge]
Think I didn't taste it?
There were tangy bites
At least I had the decency
To keep my doubts out of sight
Only whispers 'bout this topping fight
And my puzzled plight
Oh, Lord, I think about ordering
Just plain ol' pepperoni
Just to see you arguing (Arguing)
And say the one thing I've been pondering, but no

[Outro]
(Tangy bites; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred pizza debates later (Oh)
(Tangy bites) I was hoping you'd change
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Is it? Is it? Weird or tasty? Is it?)
