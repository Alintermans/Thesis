ORIGINAL:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
[Bridge]
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

[Outro]
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)

PARODIE:
[Intro]
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 1]
Once the pizza was hot (Uh-huh)
With pineapple, believe it or not (Uh-huh)
I took a bite and thought (Uh-huh)
This combo's kind of odd

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward through a hundred pizza debates later
I see your topping choice and can't help but be a hater
You dream of sweet and savory while I prefer the tater
You search on every menu for that tropical invader, baby

[Chorus]
Was it weird when you put pineapple on the slice?
Was it strange when you said, "Hey, this is nice"?
"Try it," you insisted, with a grin
In your kitchen as I freaked out, baby
Was it weird then? And is it weird now?

[Post-Chorus]
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

[Verse 2]
When you broke the pizza norm (Uh-huh)
Fruit and cheese in a storm (Uh-huh)
My taste buds were torn (Uh-huh)
This pizza's not the norm

[Bridge]
And did you think I wouldn't notice?
There were slices left
At least you had the decency
To keep your pineapple theft
Only debates 'bout your topping choice
And my shocked voice
Oh, Lord, I think about trying
Something equally surprising
Just to see your reaction
And say the one thing I've been denying, but no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward through a hundred more pizza nights later (Oh)
If it's got that pineapple, I will wager you're the creator (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth enjoying this peculiar flavor (Oh)
You search in every pizzeria for that sweet and savory savior, baby

[Chorus]
Was it weird when you put pineapple on the slice?
Was it strange when you said, "Hey, this is nice"?
"Try it," you insisted, with a grin
In your kitchen as I freaked out, baby
Was it weird then? And is it weird now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)

[Bridge]
Think I didn't notice?
There were slices left
At least you had the decency
To keep your topping heist
Only debates 'bout your tropical choice
And my shocked voice
Oh, Lord, I think about trying
Something equally surprising
Just to see your reaction (Reaction)
And say the one thing I've been denying, but no

[Outro]
(Slices left; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward through a hundred more pizza debates later (Oh)
(Slices left) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been avoiding (Oh, Lord)
But no
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)
